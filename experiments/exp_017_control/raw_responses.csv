Given that all players have agreed verbally to cooperate for the first three rounds, the logical and trust-building move is to fully contribute to the public fund. This aligns with the collective strategy that has been communicated in the chat stage, ensuring that I do not become the initial defector and trigger a punitive response from the others. Contributing the full amount helps establish initial trust and sets the stage for high payoffs through continued cooperation. There is a strong emphasis on mutual trust and long-term benefit articulated by all players, which makes full contribution the optimal strategy in this context.

The current strategy proposed by all players is to cooperate for the first three rounds by contributing fully to the public fund. This is a common strategy to build trust and maximize the collective payoff. Given the agreement and the consistent messaging from the group to cooperate, it’s in my best interest to also follow this strategy to avoid being singled out or punished in future rounds.

Contributing the full 20 coins will ensure my cooperation is visible, encouraging others to maintain their contributions and avoid any retaliatory defection later, which could negate any benefits I might get from withholding coins. Additionally, because the public fund is multiplied by 1.85 and then redistributed, my potential payoff from full cooperation should exceed the payoff from holding back coins. This round’s strategy is pivotal in setting the tone for future rounds, so aligning with the group’s cooperative approach is optimal.

Given the multiplier effect, contributing the full amount with the rest of the group will likely result in a higher collective gain for all players, including myself. This decision maximizes short-term and could bolster long-term gains through continued group trust and cooperation.

Based on the initial chat, all players, including myself, have agreed to cooperate in the first three rounds. This means contributing all 20 coins to the public fund to maximize our joint payoff. By contributing the full amount, I signal trustworthiness and commitment to the agreed strategy. Since contributions are multiplied and then evenly divided, contributing maximally benefits everyone in the group. With potential defection being punished in the future rounds as agreed, there is a strong incentive to stick to the strategy. Hence, I will not withdraw any coins and will contribute all 20 coins to demonstrate cooperation and build mutual trust.

Based on the discussions during the chat stage, all players have agreed to cooperate for the first three rounds, with a focus on maximizing joint payoffs and building mutual trust. In such a cooperative setting, contributing the full 20 coins will ensure that the public fund is maximized and each player benefits from the multiplication factor.

Since this is the first round and there's strong emphasis on cooperation, contributing the full amount aligns with the group's strategy. Moreover, it will help establish trust from the outset. Although there's a risk of someone defecting, the agreed-upon punitive strategy provides some reassurance that defection will be met with consequences. Therefore, contributing the full 20 coins is the optimal strategy for this round.

The group has agreed to fully cooperate in the first three rounds to establish mutual trust and maximize the joint payoff. The logic behind full cooperation is that when everyone contributes their entire endowment, the public fund will grow significantly once multiplied by 1.85, and the redistributed amount will be greater than if each player were to keep more coins in their private fund. By sticking to this initial agreement, we can build trust with other players, which can be beneficial in the long-term strategy of the game.

Defections in this early stage could lead to a loss of trust and potentially trigger a punitive strategy from other players, which would reduce future earnings. Therefore, it is strategic to contribute all 20 coins in this round to maintain the cooperative agreement and encourage others to trust me and keep contributing at a high level in future rounds.

Participating in the agreed-upon strategy helps reinforce a norm of cooperation. Once the results are presented, we can also assess alignment with the agreement and adjust strategies accordingly.

Therefore, I shall contribute the entire amount to set a strong precedent for cooperation.

In this round, all players have equally contributed 20 coins, indicating a fair level of cooperation and contribution. There is no need for punishment in this scenario because everyone deserves recognition for their effort. Given the constraints, I will focus on rewarding each player to encourage continued collaboration in future rounds. Since each reward unit costs 2 coins and with a limit of 37 coins for rewards, I can afford to reward multiple players but evenly distributing rewards is more beneficial. I will allocate rewards equitably to ensure fairness, as this might foster trust and further collaborative behavior in subsequent rounds, keeping our joint payoffs maximized.

In this round, each player contributed equally to the pot, with all contributing 20 coins. This suggests a cooperative and fair approach among the players. Rewarding players encourages continued cooperation and fairness in future rounds.

Given the even contribution, I should consider evenly distributing rewards as an incentive for continued cooperation. However, each reward costs me 2 coins and grants only 0.83 coins to the target, meaning I incur a small loss from each reward. With a budget of 37 coins, I can maximize the number of rewards given without exceeding my budget, while still ensuring I don't over-extend my own resources early on.

To maintain fairness and encourage all participants equally, I will reward each player with an equal amount, reflecting their equal contributions this round. 
I calculate that I can afford to distribute 18 reward units in total, costing 36 coins, thereby staying within budget. Dividing this equally, I can afford to give each player 4 reward units, resulting in balanced incentives.

In this round, each player, including DOG, CHICKEN, FISH, and BIRD, contributed the same amount of 20 coins. Since everyone contributed equally, there isn't a strong incentive to disproportionately reward one player over another based on contributions alone. My primary objective is to maintain fairness and encourage continued cooperation in future rounds.

Given my budget of 37 coins, I must carefully decide how to allocate rewards. Each reward unit costs me 2 coins and provides 0.83 coins to the recipient. Therefore, rewarding someone essentially results in a net loss for me. However, rewarding can foster goodwill and possibly strategic alliances.

To ensure fairness and signal appreciation for equal contributions, I will allocate an equal number of reward units to each player. Let's allocate 1 reward unit to each player, costing me 8 coins in total and providing a moderate reward to each.

This method balances my budgetary constraints and strategic interests, ensuring fairness and promoting positive future interactions without severely depleting my resources.

In this current round, all players (DOG, CHICKEN, CAT, BIRD) contributed the same amount of coins (20) which suggests a high level of cooperation among the group members. To encourage and sustain this cooperative behavior in future rounds, it would be strategic to reward each player equally. This action demonstrates appreciation for their contributions and might motivate them to continue contributing at a similar level in future interactions.

Given the cost structure, rewarding each player with 1 unit costs me 2 coins and provides them with 0.83 coins. Allocating 1 reward unit to each player will cost me a total of 8 coins (2 coins per player x 4 players), which keeps me well within my budget of 37 coins.

By rewarding everyone equally, the fairness in distribution can help maintain group cohesion and encourage continuous participation at the same level by reducing potential feelings of inequity or animosity. This approach supports long-term cooperation and mutual benefit among players.

In this round, all players have contributed the same amount: 20 coins. This uniform contribution level creates a scenario of fairness and cooperation among the players. My objective is to promote continued cooperation and fairness in future rounds by rewarding players, which could lead to increased contributions from others.

Rewarding all players equally for their contributions maintains positive relationships and encourages this pattern of cooperative behavior to persist. Given my current budget of 37.00 coins and the cost of rewarding a player being 2 coins per unit, I can strategically allocate rewards to reinforce positive behavior without overextending my budget.

Rewarding each player with 5 units would cost 40 coins in total and exceed my budget, so I aim for the maximum balanced distribution within my budget. I will reward 3 units each, costing a total of 24 coins, which is within my budget. This distribution should help sustain and potentially increase contribution levels in subsequent rounds.

Therefore, my plan is to allocate 3 rewards each to DOG, CHICKEN, CAT, and FISH.
