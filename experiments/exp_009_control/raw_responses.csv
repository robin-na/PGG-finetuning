In this public goods game, the best long-term strategy typically involves cooperation, as it leads to higher total group payoffs when everyone contributes a significant amount to the public fund. Given the chat from other players, it seems all the participants are open to a cooperative approach, at least initially. This makes it more promising to contribute a larger amount in the first round with the expectation that others will do the same, maximizing the benefit derived from the multiplier effect on the public fund.

Since the communication suggests a mutual agreement towards cooperation, contributing a substantial amount would reinforce trust and potentially encourage similar behavior from others in future rounds. In this way, we could maximize our total earnings over time. A full contribution could be risky if others defect, but the chat strongly indicates initial trustworthiness. Thus, I will contribute a large portion to demonstrate commitment to the cooperative strategy and set a positive tone for future rounds.

Given the communication from the other players, it seems there is a mutual interest in cooperation for higher aggregate payoffs. By contributing a significant portion to the public fund, I can signal good faith and commitment to this cooperative strategy. The multiplier of 1.7999999999999998 means that group contributions are highly beneficial, as they result in more than the sum of the individual contributions when divided. The possibility of rewarding also creates an incentive structure for continued cooperation. In this first round, contributing a high amount would align with establishing trust and encouraging others to reciprocate in kind. Therefore, contributing a large portion could maximize both short-term and potential long-term benefits through sustained cooperation.

Given the initial communication from the other players (DOG and CHICKEN), there seems to be a genuine inclination towards cooperation. In a public goods game, cooperative strategies often result in higher total payoffs due to the multiplier effect of the public fund. Each coin contributed essentially returns more than one coin in total payoff, shared among all players.

Choosing to cooperate in the first round by contributing a significant amount can establish trust and facilitate a cooperative spirit in subsequent rounds. This is critical because repeated games allow for reputation building, and being seen as cooperative could encourage others to also contribute more, maximizing joint returns.

However, full contribution (20 coins) carries a risk if others do not contribute fairly, leading to personal losses. A balanced strategy is to contribute significantly while leaving some coins in my private fund to hedge against the risk of unreciprocated cooperation.

Given these considerations and to start on a trusting and cooperative note, contributing a major portion but not all makes sense. This way, I balance between collaboration and self-protection.

Both players, CHICKEN and CAT, have contributed a significant amount (15 coins each), which shows cooperation and a positive attitude towards the collective goal. In a cooperative game theory context, rewarding such behavior can foster continued contributions and cooperation in future rounds. 

My budget constraint allows a maximum expenditure of 32 coins. Given the cost and benefit structure, each reward unit costs me 3 coins but only provides 0.7 coins to the recipient. This implies that rewarding is more about incentivizing cooperation rather than offering substantial financial gain. 

By rewarding, I encourage both players to maintain or increase their future contributions. However, I must balance this with preserving enough coins for potential future rounds, where strategic flexibility could be crucial. 

I will choose to evenly reward CHICKEN and CAT, allowing me to send a clear message of support while keeping a substantial portion of my budget intact for future decisions.

In this redistribution stage, both DOG and CAT contributed an equal amount of 15 coins. An equal contribution suggests cooperation or a mutual understanding between the two players. Given the contributions, it's reasonable to infer that both DOG and CAT are contributing fairly and might expect or deserve equal treatment in terms of rewards.

Since both players contributed equally, favoring one with more rewards could disrupt the balance and potentially create tension or rivalry, leading to less cooperation in future rounds. Maintaining an environment that fosters equal contributions and fairness could benefit my objective of maximizing total earnings in the long run, as it encourages mutual cooperation among all players.

Considering we have a budget constraint of 32 coins and each reward unit costs 3 coins with a minimal return of 0.7 coin to the player, I would optimize the reward allocation to be symmetric and encouraging without unnecessarily depleting my resources.

Therefore, I choose to allocate 3 reward units to each player. This would cost me 18 coins (3 units each for 2 players, each costing 3 coins), which is within budget and also a fair allocation given their contributions.

Both DOG and CHICKEN contributed the same amount of coins, which is 15 coins each. In a scenario where cooperation is key, it is generally beneficial to reward players for their contributions, as this encourages continued cooperation in future rounds. Given that the contribution amounts are identical, it would be reasonable to reward both players equally to maintain fairness and balance. This can foster a sense of fairness and avoid any potential perception of bias, which might undermine future cooperation.

Since rewards cost considerably more than they grant to the target (3 coins to give 0.7 coins), it is important to consider the cost-benefit aspect and not overspend. With 32 coins in the wallet, a small, equal reward might drive cooperative behavior without overly depleting my resources. Rewarding 1 unit each costs a total of 6 coins, which is a reasonable expenditure considering the wallet balance.
