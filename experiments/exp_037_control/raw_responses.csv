In this public goods game, the key is to balance my contributions in a way that maximizes my total earnings. If both players contribute 20 coins, the total in the public fund will be 40 coins. After being multiplied by 1.12, the fund will be 44.8 coins, which when divided evenly will give each player 22.4 coins. This is a clear gain over keeping all 20 coins privately, resulting in a 2.4 coin increase.

However, the risk lies in the possibility of the other player contributing nothing. If I contribute all 20 coins and the other player contributes nothing, the fund will be 20 coins, multiplied to 22.4, and evenly divided to give each of us 11.2 coins. In this case, I would end up with a net loss compared to keeping the 20 coins privately.

Therefore, to enhance cooperation and maximize earnings, it would be strategic to contribute all 20 coins, hoping that the other player also reciprocates. This initial round is critical to building trust and cooperation which could have compounding benefits in the subsequent rounds.

Taking into account the initial cooperative signal, I will contribute all my coins.

In this game, the optimal strategy depends significantly on predicting the actions of the other player. If both players contribute all their coins, the public fund will be maximized, and both players will ultimately receive a higher payoff. Conversely, if one player contributes and the other does not, the non-contributor benefits more by keeping their private funds while still gaining from the public fund's redistribution.

Since this is the first round and there is no prior behavior to assess, I must rely on basic strategic theories. One approach is to contribute nothing, which is a risk-averse strategy, maximizing my sure payoff in case the other player decides to contribute. However, this could lead to mistrust if repeated behavior prevents mutual cooperation. On the other hand, contributing all can maximize growth collectively but runs the risk of being exploited.

For this first round, to set a cooperative tone and see how the 'CHICKEN' player reacts, I will choose to contribute all my coins, hoping to establish a pattern of cooperation.
