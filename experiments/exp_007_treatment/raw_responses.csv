In this public goods game, we're dealing with a mix of individual and group incentives. The public fund is a collaborative resource that benefits everyone when it's maximally contributed to and then multiplied. However, individual players might be tempted to ""free-ride"" by withdrawing all their coins into their private fund while still benefiting from others' contributions.

If everyone contributes their full 20 coins, the public fund will be maximized, and each player will receive a substantial return from the 2.79 multiplier. However, the presence of deduction and reward mechanisms implies potential consequences for free-riding or rewarding cooperative behavior.

Given that this is an early round, my strategy is to test the waters by contributing all my coins to signal cooperation and to observe how others respond. This strategy sets a cooperative tone and increases the likelihood of receiving rewards, while reducing the risk of deductions. If everyone else also contributes fully, the payoff is quite favorable for everyone. In the long term, demonstrating cooperation early might encourage others to also contribute fully in future rounds.

In deciding whether to contribute all of my coins or none to the public fund, I need to consider the potential payoff from cooperation versus personal gain from defection. If all players contribute their 20 coins, the public fund becomes 180 coins (20 x 9), which, when multiplied by 2.79, becomes 502.2 coins. This would mean each of us receives 55.8 coins (502.2 / 9) back, which is a significant increase from the original 20 coins.

On the contrary, if I withdraw all my coins, I maximize my private funds to 20, while still benefiting from others' contributions. Given there's no communication, it's likely that some players will defect to maximize their personal gains. However, contribution often leads to higher collective payoff and might lead to reduced deductions from others and more potential rewards.

Moreover, post-contribution deductions and rewards introduce another strategic layer. Contributing nothing might prompt retaliation from others through deductions, while contributing may result in rewards.

Given these factors, I choose to contribute all of my coins to signal cooperation and potentially receive rewards, which can further increase my payoff beyond immediate and short-sighted personal maximization.

In this public goods game, optimal collaboration would be achieved if all players contribute their entire 20 coins because the fund is multiplied by 2.79, providing a higher collective payoff. However, given that individuals can choose to either contribute 20 coins or nothing and can later impose punishments or rewards based on contributions, the dynamics introduce complexity.

Here, the decision to contribute all or nothing is somewhat influenced by incentives for cooperation via punishments for low contributions and rewards for high contributions. Contributing nothing maximizes individual short-term gains since you retain all 20 coins and still receive a share of the multiplied pool. However, this behavior may provoke punishment from other players. In contrast, contributing all coins aligns with collective interest and could minimize the risk of punishment, possibly even garnering rewards.

In this one-shot game, considering that any punishment or reward mechanism comes at a cost to the imploring party and that a strong focus on long-term relationships is absent, the optimal move becomes more challenging. I will contribute all coins to the fund, assuming other players may have similar incentives toward collectivization, and this minimizes punishment risk while potentially optimizing for group reward dynamics.

In this public goods game, contributing nothing (withdrawing all 20 coins) or everything (withdrawing nothing) are the only two options. The maximum long-term payoff for the group is achieved if everyone contributes all their coins. This is because the fund is multiplied by 2.79 and distributed, suggesting a group payoff significantly higher than individual retention.

However, individual players might act selfishly by contributing nothing while still benefiting from the public fund's distribution. I will assume that other players might also consider contributing all for better group payoff and because post-contribution rewards can be given to boost the total gain if they notice consistent cooperation.

In this one-round game, I will contribute all my coins. This decision might endear cooperation or at the very least minimize deductions from those who value cooperation, while also making me a candidate for rewards from supportive players.

In this game, the ideal strategy depends on the behavior of other players, whom I cannot communicate with or predict perfectly. Contributing all my coins can maximize the collective pot, resulting in a higher payoff for everyone. Additionally, a high contribution might avoid penalties from other players and possibly earn rewards if others perceive this as cooperative behavior. However, choosing to contribute nothing maximizes my guaranteed income from private funds and avoids any risk of loss from player deduction actions.

Given the multiplier of the public fund (2.79), contributing all coins to the public fund generally results in a higher collective payoff, and since this is the only round, there's no punishment/reward history to base strategies on. Thus, cooperative behavior may lead to positive returns in this one-time interaction due to the substantial amplification of returns via the multiplier. Moreover, not contributing can trigger deductions from other players who may want to punish free-riding, which could wipe out any initial advantage.

Considering these points, contributing all the coins might be the best strategy to maximize both personal and collective gains in this game round while maintaining a positive reception from others.

In this single round of the public goods game, my primary goal is to maximize my total earnings. Contributing nothing could seem optimal since I would keep all 20 coins in my private fund. However, this could provoke punishment from other players if they perceive my non-contribution as unfair, leading them to spend their coins to impose deductions on me, which would ultimately reduce my earnings.

On the other hand, by contributing all 20 coins to the public fund, I signal cooperation and may avoid punishment. Additionally, if others also contribute, the pool multiplies by 2.79, meaning the shared payoff would be considerable. For example, if everyone contributes (180 coins total), the fund would become 502.2 coins, yielding a payoff of around 55.8 coins per player. My net payoff would be higher than simply keeping the 20 coins.

Given these dynamics and the lack of communication, contributing all of my coins could encourage a positive outcome. Even if some players contribute nothing, I may still benefit from any cooperation and avoid costly punishments. On balance, the potential gain from cooperation outweighs the risk, especially with the multiplier effect in play.

Thus, strategically, contributing all coins seems wise.

In this public goods game, maximizing total earnings involves considering both the benefits of contributing to the public fund and the subsequent possible deductions or rewards.

1. **Contribution Decision**: The total payoff is determined by how much is in the public fund, multiplied by 2.79, and then divided among all players. Contributing nothing and hoping others will contribute can lead to free-riding benefits in the short term, but there's a risk of being punished or facing retaliation in terms of deductions.

2. **Potential Deductions**: If I withdraw everything (20 coins), the others will see that I did not contribute to the public fund at all. There's a strong possibility that other players will impose deductions on me, which would reduce my earnings significantly more than potentially losing what's in the public fund by contributing.

3. **Social Norms and Future Reputation**: Even though this is a single round, players may still follow social norms of fairness and cooperation, meaning non-contributors could be punished to align with those norms. On the other hand, contributors might receive rewards as encouragement.

Given the above, contributing the full 20 coins prevents any negative deductions from others, as it shows cooperative intent. While there's no guarantee of being rewarded, the contribution ensures I'm aligned with potential norms of fairness among the group.

Therefore, I will contribute the full 20 coins to the public fund.

In this public goods game, the payoff from contributing to the public fund is calculated by multiplying the total contributions by 2.79 and then dividing it equally among all 9 players. Each player’s potential payoff from the public fund depends on the total contributions made by the group.

Let's consider the scenarios:

1. **If everyone contributes all 20 coins (including me)**
   - Total contribution = 9 players * 20 coins = 180 coins
   - Multiplied amount = 180 * 2.79 = 502.2 coins
   - Each player's payoff from the public fund = 502.2 / 9 ≈ 55.8 coins
   - My final coins = 55.8 (public) + 0 (private) = 55.8 coins

2. **If I alone do not contribute while others do (free-rider)**
   - Total contribution = 8 players * 20 coins = 160 coins
   - Multiplied amount = 160 * 2.79 = 446.4 coins
   - Each player's payoff from the public fund = 446.4 / 9 ≈ 49.6 coins
   - My final coins = 49.6 (public) + 20 (private) = 69.6 coins

3. **If I contribute and others do not (sucker)**
   - Total contribution = 1 player * 20 coins = 20 coins
   - Multiplied amount = 20 * 2.79 = 55.8 coins
   - Each player's payoff from the public fund = 55.8 / 9 ≈ 6.2 coins
   - My final coins = 6.2 (public) + 0 (private) = 6.2 coins

Since it's a single round game with no communication, maximizing personal payoff is prioritized. By withdrawing all 20 coins to my private fund, I ensure a guaranteed 20 coins. If everyone else contributes, I can benefit further from the public fund. 

There is a risk of deductions by other players if they view non-contribution negatively, but the game dynamics favor initially securing coins and potentially rewarding or punishing post-round based on observed contributions.

Given these considerations, the optimal choice appears to be to withdraw all 20 coins to my private fund.

In this public goods game, my goal is to maximize my total earnings while considering the actions of other players. Contributing 0 coins (i.e., withdrawing all 20 coins) would ensure that I keep the entire amount in my private fund. However, this strategy relies on the hope that others will contribute, allowing me to benefit from the multiplier effect without contributing myself. 

Conversely, if I contribute all 20 coins, I would be fully investing in the public good, potentially maximizing the group's total payoff if others do the same.

Since this is a single round game and contribution levels are revealed afterward allowing for punishment or reward, a strong incentive exists to contribute to align with group norms and avoid negative consequences. Players are often inclined to punish low contributors, which could be costly.

Therefore, contributing all 20 coins is a strategic choice to:
1. Align with group norms, avoiding punishment.
2. Maximize the potential total available for distribution, possibly increasing my final payoff.

This strategy considers both immediate benefits and potential long-term outcomes like avoiding deductions.

In this redistribution stage, I aim to maximize my earnings while considering long-term strategy implications. My options are to either punish or reward other players, and I must do so with a clear strategy in mind since both punishment and reward have costs.

Firstly, rewards typically foster positive future interactions or alliances, whereas punishment may deter unfavorable actions from others but can also create adversarial relationships.

Given my budget constraint of 55.80 coins, I must be strategic:

1. **Team Building/Collaboration:** Players who have shown consistent cooperative behavior in the past should be rewarded to maintain positive relations and potentially receive reciprocal rewards in the future. 
   
2. **Blocking Threats:** Players who tend to disrupt the overall group's goals might need to be punished to discourage negative behavior.

3. **Neutrals:** Players who neither contribute positively nor negatively should remain unpunished unless there's a strategic value in incentivizing them towards cooperation.

Given no historical context is provided, I'll assume a balanced route where I slightly reward cooperative behavior and refrain from punishment due to the high cost for minor immediate return.

- As a default stance, a light reward across most players can be a gesture of goodwill promoting a friendly or neutral stance, leading to potential alliances.

Let’s assign 5 reward units to one player who seems like the most strategic ally candidate, distribute 2 reward units to three other players to foster cooperation, and save the rest of the coins for future stages or interactions.

In this stage, I need to decide whether to reward or punish other players to maximize my future gains. The cost of rewarding is greater than the gain for the target player, so rewards should be used strategically with players who can potentially help me in the future. Punishments cost more than rewards in terms of financial drain without reliable future gains, so they should be used sparingly and only if necessary to discourage actions that could harm me. 

Considering rational cooperation, I aim to foster potential alliances or reinforce existing positive relationships by using small rewards strategically. Since I don't have historical data with specific actions or outcomes from each player here, a balanced approach minimizing excessive resource expenditure is prudent.

Thus, I assume players who can potentially aid collaboratively will be rewarded minimally, avoiding spending too aggressively, while maintaining a defensive budget for unfavorable future actions I might want to counteract with punishments.

The total available for redistribution is 55.80 coins, limiting reward or punishment decisions to a strategic, balanced amount.

In determining how to allocate my coins for punishments or rewards, I must consider the following factors:
1. **Historical Behavior:** I should focus on rewarding players who have previously cooperated and punished those who have consistently defected, assuming such historical data is available.
2. **Impact of Actions:** Rewards slightly have a better net benefit than punishments since the reward almost gives back as much as it costs (2 coins for 1.46 coins to the recipient). However, rewards incentivize positive future behavior.
3. **Budget Constraint:** I have 55.80 coins, so I can use a maximum of 27 units (costing 54 coins) if I were to distribute entirely in one direction (either reward or punishment).
4. **Future Strategy:** Encouraging allies or discouraging competitors might set a favorable future course for my interactions with these players.

Since I don't have specific historical data in this context, I'll assume a fair-minded approach where I aim to reward relationships that could be mutually beneficial and lightly punish those who have more competitive or aggressive playstyles so far.

Decisions:
- Prioritize rewarding potential allies or historically cooperative players.
- Apply a minor punishment to competitors or likely competitors.

Assuming balanced historical behavior assessments where players generally shared gains or losses equally, I’ll distribute rewards evenly among players with a slight favor on those assumed to be alignable partners.

Finally, due to lack of explicit historical player strategies, I'll choose a conservative middle-ground strategy with rewards to balance influence without exhausting resources.

To make the best strategic decision, I will consider alliances, past behavior, and potential future cooperation with the other players:

1. **DOG and CAT**: If they have been cooperative or beneficial to me in the past, rewarding them could foster continued support. If they've been adversarial, punishing them might deter future negative behavior.

2. **CHICKEN and RABBIT**: Should be considered based on their influence and position in the game. If aligning with them increases my chances of receiving reciprocal rewards or strategic advantage, rewarding might be sensible.

3. **BIRD and TURTLE**: Evaluate their past interactions. If they are neutral or opportunistic, remain cautious. Only reward if there's a clear benefit to align, or punish if they’ve consistently disrupted my strategy.

4. **HAMSTER and FROG**: Consider their current status. Are they in a position to affect my future objectives? If so, incentivizing them through rewards could establish a cooperative dynamic.

I will prioritize rewards over punishments, as positive reinforcement may yield a greater return if others reciprocate. However, I'll maintain caution against overspending my budget.

Here's a rough allocation strategy:
- Allocate smaller rewards to those who've been allies or neutral but beneficial in the past.
- Consider minimal punishment to deter negative behavior from a player with a history of obstruction.

Spending plan:
- Reserve a maximum of 22 units (44 coins) across rewards.
- Leave flexibility for necessary small-scale punishments if needed.

Assumptions:
- Players can remember past rewards and punishments.
- Reciprocity can materially change outcomes.
- Overall stability in relationships is preferable unless a player poses a significant threat.

Calculating the balance between short-term and long-term gain is key, as is keeping spending under control.

In order to maximize my payoff, I need to consider the potential future actions of other players and how my redistribution choices could influence their behavior. Since I have a limited budget and can only spend up to 55.80 coins, I need to be strategic.

1. **Assessment of Current Performance:** I'll look at each player's past actions (if available or assumed) to infer their potential threat or benefit to me.
   
2. **Punishments vs. Rewards:**
   - **Punishment** reduces another player's resources, potentially deterring negative actions toward me but at a cost that may not significantly impair the other player (as it costs me more than it costs them).
   - **Reward** may foster goodwill and encourage positive future interactions or reciprocation, which can be valuable if establishing alliances or cooperative dynamics is possible.

3. **Optimal Allocation:**
   - If some players have consistently acted against my interest, punishing them might deter further such actions.
   - If other players have shown signs of cooperation or neutrality, rewarding them could enhance future collaboration or deter any adversarial actions.

4. **Budget Optimization:** Given the budget constraint and the cost-value ratio of punishments and rewards, I should prioritize allocating my resources to where they can have the most substantial anticipated impact on the overall game dynamics to either help create allies or deter threats.

Based on hypothetical scenarios and player behavior:

- **DOG:** Neutral or uncertain; minimal previous interactions, neutral.
- **CHICKEN:** Has shown competitive or adversarial strategies; consider punitive deterrent.
- **CAT:** Cooperative tendencies in past interactions; reward to strengthen alliance.
- **FISH:** Neutral; no significant past interactions, neutral approach.
- **RABBIT:** Neutral or minor ally potential; small encouragement reward.
- **TURTLE:** Adversarial or threatening actions; stronger punishment considered.
- **HAMSTER:** Cooperative, valuable potential ally; moderate reward is sensible.
- **FROG:** Neutral or cooperative; small reward to encourage goodwill.

Budget Calculations:
- Punishment (CHICKEN, TURTLE): Target significant threats (consider spending 10 coins each = 20 coins total).
- Reward (CAT, HAMSTER, RABBIT, FROG): Foster or maintain alliances (CAT 10 coins, HAMSTER 10 coins, RABBIT 6 coins, FROG 6 coins = 32 coins total).

In deciding how to allocate my coins for punishments or rewards, I need to consider the long-term effects of my actions on the game dynamics and my own payoff. The cost of both punishment and reward to me is 2 coins, while punishment decreases the target's coins by 1, and reward increases the target's coins by 1.46. Thus, rewards provide a net positive change to the group as a whole, which could foster a more cooperative environment.

Given that my total budget is 55.80 coins, I have several options to distribute between punishments and rewards. Rewarding players who likely contribute positively to the game's overall progress or who are likely to reciprocate may boost collective group payoff and indirectly benefit me. On the other hand, punishing players who act against the group's interests or threaten my own standing could signal the need for strategic realignment within the game.

Without specific historical behaviors or performance metrics for each player, my strategy will emphasize a greater inclination toward rewards, promoting a collaborative environment unless past actions provide a strong reason to punish. Given that all players need to be addressed, I will balance distribution by giving more rewards to those whom I presume have been or will likely be cooperative.

In this redistribution stage, I must carefully allocate my budget of 55.80 coins, considering both the potential positive and negative impacts of rewards and punishments. Punishments are costly for me and only remove half of what they cost from the target, making them efficient if a player is acting against the group's interest or if they are a threat to my potential earnings. Rewards, while improving relations and promoting cooperation, cost more to me than they benefit the recipient because each unit costs me 2 coins but only rewards the other player 1.46 coins.

First, I'll consider previous behaviors: which players have shown cooperative behavior, which ones have acted selfishly, and which might benefit from incentivization.

1. **DOG**: If DOG has historically been a cooperative player, a reward could strengthen the alliance. Otherwise, no action is necessary.
2. **CHICKEN**: If known for strategic disruptions to group welfare, a slight punishment could deter future negative actions.
3. **CAT**: Seen as neutral, neither distinctly beneficial nor harmful, a reward could help and strengthen potential future cooperation.
4. **FISH**: Reward to encourage or maintain cooperative mutualism if FISH has shown such potential before.
5. **BIRD**: Punishment if BIRD has a history of undermining cooperative efforts but cautiously considering budget constraints.
6. **RABBIT**: A player who often collaborates should be rewarded to reinforce such behavior.
7. **HAMSTER**: If there's been evidence of detrimental behavior, some punishment should be enough to signal discontent.
8. **FROG**: Using the rest of the budget on a small reward to boost cooperation, assuming reciprocal potential.

The objective is to influence future behavior to maximize my payoff. Rewards should be used to encourage beneficial actions from cooperative players, while punishments might discourage detrimental actions from competitors.

To allocate my resources effectively, I must consider:

1. Historical Behavior: If I have historical data on these players, I'll reward those who have previously cooperated or are likely to reciprocate. I'll punish players who have been adversarial or are likely to exploit others’ generosity.

2. Impact of Actions: Since rewards currently have a better incentive-to-cost ratio (1.46 received for 2 spent), they may be more effective if targeting potentially cooperative individuals.

3. Budget: With a 55.80 coin constraint, I can’t afford to impact all players meaningfully. Prioritizing a few key influencers or deterrents is wiser.

Assumptions: Due to lack of specific historical data in the prompt, I'll assume mixed historical behaviors and focus only on key actions rather than widespread reallocations. 

Decision:
- Reward cooperative/detrimental-to-opponent players more with the expectation of reciprocal actions.
- Punish strategic adversarial behavior but focus spending on rewards due to higher returns.

Plan:
- Reward DOG, CAT, and BIRD more, assuming they are cooperative or influential.
- Punish CHICKEN if past behavior was adversarial.
- Neutral on others due to budget constraints and lack of distinct historical insights.

Calculated Spend Based on Budget:
- Reward DOG with 10 units (20 coins) - **Strategic influencer**
- Reward CAT with 9 units (18 coins) - **Likely cooperative**
- Reward BIRD with 7 units (14 coins) - **Potential incentivizing**
- Punish CHICKEN with 1 unit (2 coins) to deter (if adversarial)

To maximize my total earnings, I need to consider both the potential impact of my actions on my relationships with other players and the budget constraint. Punishing other players costs more than rewarding them in terms of impact per coin spent, so I might consider rewards more often if I want to foster cooperative behavior.

Given the budget constraint of 55.80 coins, I aim to spend it judiciously to influence favorable outcomes in future rounds. I should also consider the historical behavior of these players (if available) to decide who might be worth rewarding to encourage positive interactions.

Without historical behavior data, I will base decisions on assumptions:
- Players typically aiding group outcomes in similar setups might be rewarded slightly to encourage continued cooperation.
- I should not heavily punish without clear rationale, as it could lead to retaliation in future stages.

As a strategic choice, focusing on rewarding could strengthen alliances or collaborative plays, particularly with those known to have positive impacts.

I will choose low reward units for several players, ensuring my total expenses do not exceed the budget and are distributed in a manner that promotes potential future collaboration.
