CHICKEN,1,VALIDATION_10_T,,,5,作为第一个回合，我应该贡献一部分资金以促进合作。考虑到乘数为1.9，如果大家都能贡献，总收益会更高。我会贡献5个硬币，既支持合作又不会过于冒险。,{},,
CROCODILE,1,VALIDATION_10_T,Let's cooperate to maximize our collective gains!,"Since this is the first round, I should consider the potential for cooperation. Contributing some coins to the shared pot could lead to higher overall gains, as the pot is multiplied by 1.9 and split equally. However, I need to balance this with the risk of others not contributing, which might result in a lower return. I'll start by contributing a moderate amount, say 10 coins, to encourage cooperation while keeping some for myself.",20,,{},,
MONKEY,1,VALIDATION_10_T,,,20,"To maximize collective gains, I should contribute as much as possible. The multiplier is 1.9×, which is greater than 1, so contributing benefits everyone.",{},,"I should contribute 20 coins to the shared pot to maximize the total pot, which will then be multiplied by 1.9 and split evenly. This ensures the highest possible return for all players."

CROCODILE,3,VALIDATION_10_T,,"Based on the previous rounds, I notice that my contributions are being matched by others. In round 1, I contributed 20 coins, and others contributed 5 and 20. In round 2, both others contributed 20. This suggests that others might be following a cooperative strategy. To maintain the positive outcome, I should continue contributing 20 coins to the pot. This will ensure that the total contribution is maximized, leading to a higher multiplied pot and equal shares. I should not punish anyone as there's no evidence of free-riding.",nan,...,{},,

CHICKEN,5,VALIDATION_10_T,我们需要保持合作，共同最大化收益。,在第五轮，我注意到其他玩家的贡献有所波动。CROCODILE在第三轮贡献了0，而MONKEY持续贡献20。这可能影响了整体收益。我需要考虑是否调整自己的贡献策略。由于乘数是1.9，如果大家都能贡献，总收益会更高。但考虑到之前的贡献情况，可能需要更谨慎。我会贡献8个硬币，保持一定的合作，同时避免过度投入。,15,在观察到其他玩家行为的变化后，特别是看到CROCODILE的贡献下降，我需要调整策略。为了促进更有效的合作并确保集体收益最大化，我会贡献15个硬币，以鼓励他人跟进，同时保持自己的合理收益。,{},,
