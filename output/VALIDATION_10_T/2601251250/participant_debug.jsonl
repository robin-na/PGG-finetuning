In round 3, I contributed 20, but CHICKEN only contributed 5. This inconsistency might lower the overall pot. To encourage more contributions, I should consider contributing less in the next round. However, I need to maintain a fair approach to avoid being exploited. Maybe contribute 10 coins, which is less than the maximum but still a significant amount. This way, I can signal that I'm willing to contribute, but others should do the same"}
