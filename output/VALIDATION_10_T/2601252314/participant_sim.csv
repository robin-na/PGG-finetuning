This round I will put a little more than Snake, who is now the most generous player in the group. I will trust that the others will start to follow my example and contribute in the next round. If Snake was doing this all along, that would be awesome! Now I am going to put a little more coins and show I trust the cooperative behavior from Snake.","{""SNAKE"":12}",,"It is the third round, and it has been observed that even though Snake is the most generous player, they tend to receive negative feedback for being a free-loader. This shows that Snake is indeed not acting as a trustworthy player. They do not have a history of cooperation, and have been rewarded for low or zero contributions all this while. That is why I will choose to punish Snake for the first time to give them a chance to improve and to make an example out of WHALE."
