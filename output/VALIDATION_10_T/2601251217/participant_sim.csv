SNAKE,1,VALIDATION_10_T,Let's work together for a common goal! Contribution: 5 coins.,"1. I will start by contributing a moderate amount, say 5 coins, to encourage cooperation. 2. I will assess the group's response in the next round before adjusting my contribution. 3. I will communicate a positive message to promote collaboration.",20,,{},,"1. The total contribution was 41, which is high, but the multiplier (1.9) leads to 77.9. Divided by 3 players, each gets 25.97. 2. I contributed 20, which is more than the average of 13.67, so I should reward, not punish. 3. Since others contributed differently, I will not punish anyone."

I contributed 20, which was more than the average. 3. I did not punish anyone, and my payoff was 25. 4. I should maintain my cooperative strategy.",20,"1.

The total contribution was the same as round 1 (41), but the multiplier (1.9) gave the same return (77.9). 2. I contributed 20 again, which was more than the average. 3.

SNAKE,3,VALIDATION_10_T,,"1. In round 1 and 2, the total contribution was consistently 41, but the multiplier gave a good return. 2. I contributed 20 each time, which was more than the average, but Parrot's contribution was very low (1). 3. Parrot might be acting selfishly, so I should consider punishing them, but the cost might be high. 4. However, since the return from the pot was good, I should keep contributing and perhaps encourage Parrot to contribute more.",20,,{},,"1. Parrot increased their contribution to 3, which is still low, but better than before. 2. The total contribution is now 43, leading to a higher pot (81.7). 3. I should not punish as the return is still good, and Parrot might be trying to improve. 4. I will continue contributing 20 and avoid punishment."

SNAKE,4,VALIDATION_10_T,Let's keep contributing to maximize the shared pot.,"1. In round 3, Parrot contributed 3, which is still low, but better than before. 2. MOOSE contributed 20, and I also contributed 20. 3. The payoff for MOOSE decreased due to punishment (they spent 8 coins on punishment, leading to a lower payoff). 4. I should consider if the punishment affects the group dynamics. 5. I will continue contributing 20 to maintain the pot growth.",20,"1. In round 3, the total contribution was 43, leading to a higher pot (81.7). 2. I contributed 20, and the payoff was 27. 3. Parrot's contribution was still low (3), but they improved. 4.

SNAKE,5,VALIDATION_10_T,,"1. In round 4, Parrot's contribution dropped back to 1, which is very low. 2. MOOSE's payoff was reduced due to their own punishment, but they still contributed 20. 3. I should consider if Parrot is intentionally contributing minimally to lower the pot. 4. To ensure the shared pot benefits, I might need to punish Parrot for their low contribution. 5. The cost of punishment is 4 coins per unit, so I need to decide how many units to impose.",1,,{},,
MOOSE,5,VALIDATION_10_T,,PARROT is still not contributing fairly. I should continue punishing them to encourage more contribution.,20,,"{""SNAKE"":2,""PARROT"":2}",,SNAKE and PARROT are both contributing only 1 coin each. This is very low. I should punish both to encourage higher contributions.

SNAKE,6,VALIDATION_10_T,,,1,"1. In round 5, I contributed 1, which is very low, leading to a low pot (41.8) and a reduced payoff. 2. Despite this, the punishment from Parrot and MOOSE affected my payoff. 3. I need to consider the group dynamics and decide whether to punish or not. 4. Since my payoff is very low (8), I should adjust by either contributing more or not being punished. 5. I will decide to contribute minimally or try to improve the pot in this final round.",{},,
