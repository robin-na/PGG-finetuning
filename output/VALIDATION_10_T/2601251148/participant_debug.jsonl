This has caused the total contribution to be very low, and the shared pot has not been maximized.  I think that the GORILLA has been contributing too little, and that the MOOSE has been contributing a lot.  I would like to encourage the GORILLA to contribute more, so that the group can benefit from the shared pot.  Therefore, I will not punish anyone in this round.  I will instead focus on contributing more myself. "}
