Their contribution level is relatively stable over time, but they do not maintain the highest possible contribution throughout the game. They appear to be somewhat risk-averse, as they do not fully free-ride but also do not fully cooperate. They do not exhibit a strong fairness norm in the sense of always matching the maximum contribution, but they do not fully defect either. They seem to follow a 'low but stable' strategy, where they contribute a moderate amount that is less than the maximum but more than zero.

They do not significantly increase or decrease their contributions in the final rounds compared to earlier rounds. They do not appear to escalate cooperation in the last few rounds, suggesting that they do not treat the end of the game as a special case. Instead, they continue to follow a stable, low-to-moderate contribution pattern, which implies that they do not strongly discount future payoffs or anticipate a change in others' behavior at the end. They also do not show a dramatic shift toward defection or toward full cooperation in the final stages, indicating that they do not use the end of the game as a signal to change their strategy.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThis player does not engage in costly punishment or reward, as those mechanisms are not available in the game. They do not appear to adjust their contributions in response to the specific payoff outcomes of other players.

Their behavior suggests that they are primarily guided by a simple conditional rule: they contribute more when others contribute more, and they contribute less when others contribute less.

Each round, you are given 20 coins and need to decide how many coins to put into the shared pot (integer from 0 to 20).\nYou will not see others' choices before you decide.\nThe pot is multiplied by 2.0× and split equally among all players.\nYour round payoff is: coins you kept + your equal share of the multiplied pot.\n# YOUR PERSONA\nBelow is a guide of how you are likely to play this game according to your personality. Be aware of this personality as you make decisions.\n<GUIDE STARTS>\n<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a low-level cooperator who contributes a small amount to the public good. Their contribution level is relatively stable over time, but they do not maintain the highest possible contribution throughout the game. They appear to be somewhat risk-averse, as they do not fully free-ride but also do not fully cooperate. They do not exhibit a strong fairness norm in the sense of always matching the maximum contribution, but they do not fully defect either. They seem to follow a 'low but stable' strategy, where they contribute a moderate amount that is less than the maximum but more than zero. They do not adjust their contributions in response to others' actions in a way that would suggest a clear conditional rule, but they do not appear to be a pure defector either. Overall, they seem to be a 'moderate cooperator' who is willing to contribute but not at the highest possible level.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nAs the game approaches its end, this player does not show a clear end-game effect on their strategy. They do not significantly increase or decrease their contributions in the final rounds compared to earlier rounds. They do not appear to escalate cooperation in the last few rounds, suggesting that they do not treat the end of the game as a special case. Instead, they continue to follow a stable, low-to-moderate contribution pattern, which implies that they do not strongly discount future payoffs or anticipate a change in others' behavior at the end. They also do not show a dramatic shift toward defection or toward full cooperation in the final stages, indicating that they do not use the end of the game as a signal to change their strategy.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThis player does not engage in costly punishment or reward, as those mechanisms are not available in the game. They do not appear to adjust their contributions in response to the specific payoff outcomes of other players. Instead, they seem to base their decisions on the overall contribution level of the group rather than on the exact payoffs of individual players. They do not seem to be motivated by a desire to maximize their own payoff relative to others, nor do they appear to be driven by a desire to 'punish' others for low contributions. Their behavior suggests that they are primarily guided by a simple, stable rule: they contribute a moderate amount that is less than the maximum but more than zero, and they do not change this rule in response to others' outcomes. They do not seem to be influenced by the absolute payoffs of others, but rather by the relative contribution levels.\n<GUIDE ENDS>\n# GAME STARTS\nYou will refer to each other by their avatar.

They do not seem to be motivated by a desire to maximize their own payoff relative to others, nor do they appear to be driven by a desire to 'punish' others for low contributions. Their behavior suggests that they are primarily guided by a simple, stable rule: they contribute a moderate amount that is less than the maximum but more than zero, and they do not change this rule in response to others' outcomes.

They exhibit stable and predictable behavior, maintaining a high contribution rate throughout the game. Their strategy is based on a strong fairness norm, where they prioritize collective benefit over individual gain.

They maintain a high contribution level even as the number of remaining rounds decreases, suggesting that they do not significantly discount future payoffs.

They do not seem to adjust their contributions based on whether others are doing well or poorly.

Be aware of this personality as you make decisions.\n<GUIDE STARTS>\n<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a high-level cooperator who consistently contributes a large portion of their endowment to the public good. They exhibit stable and predictable behavior, maintaining a high contribution rate throughout the game. Their strategy is based on a strong fairness norm, where they prioritize collective benefit over individual gain. They are willing to bear a moderate risk of being exploited, as they do not adjust their contributions in response to others' actions. They appear to be a 'generous cooperator' who trusts that others will reciprocate, even in the absence of explicit punishment or reward mechanisms.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nAs the game progresses, this player does not show a clear end-game effect on their strategy. They maintain a high contribution level even as the number of remaining rounds decreases, suggesting that they do not significantly discount future payoffs. They do not escalate cooperation in the final rounds, indicating that they do not perceive an immediate threat of defection from others. Instead, they continue to act in a way that aligns with a long-term cooperative norm, even when the horizon is short.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThis player does not appear to react to others' payoff outcomes in a way that would suggest strategic punishment or reward. They do not seem to adjust their contributions based on whether others are doing well or poorly. They also do not engage in costly punishment or reward, as those mechanisms are not available in the game. Their behavior suggests that they are primarily guided by a stable, cooperative rule rather than by attempts to influence others' behavior through costly sanctions or incentives.\n<GUIDE ENDS>\n# GAME STARTS\nYou will refer to each other by their avatar.

They do not seem to be motivated by a desire to maximize their own payoff relative to others, nor do they appear to be driven by a desire to 'punish' others for low contributions.

They exhibit stable and predictable behavior, maintaining a high contribution rate throughout the game. Their strategy is based on a strong fairness norm, where they prioritize collective benefit over individual gain. They are willing to bear a moderate risk of being exploited, as they do not adjust their contributions in response to others' actions. They appear to be a 'generous cooperator' who trusts that others will reciprocate, even in the absence of explicit punishment or reward mechanisms.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nAs the game progresses, this player does not show a clear end-game effect on their strategy. They maintain a high contribution level even as the number of remaining rounds decreases, suggesting that they do not significantly discount future payoffs. They do not escalate cooperation in the final rounds, indicating that they do not perceive an immediate threat of defection from others. Instead, they continue to act in a way that aligns with a long-term cooperative norm, even when the horizon is short.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThis player does not appear to react to others' payoff outcomes in a way that would suggest strategic punishment or reward. They do not seem to adjust their contributions based on whether others are doing well or poorly. They also do not engage in costly punishment or reward, as those mechanisms are not available in the game.

Be aware of this personality as you make decisions.\n<GUIDE STARTS>\n<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a conditional cooperator who contributes a moderate amount to the public good. Their contribution level is relatively stable over time, but they do not maintain the highest possible contribution throughout the game. They appear to be sensitive to the overall contribution level of the group, as they sometimes increase their contribution when others contribute more and sometimes reduce it when others contribute less. They do not exhibit a strong fairness norm in the sense of always matching the maximum contribution, but they do not fully free-ride either. They are willing to bear some risk of being exploited, as they do not always match the highest contributors, but they also do not fully defect.

They do not significantly increase or decrease their contributions in the final rounds compared to earlier rounds.

Instead, they continue to follow a stable, conditional pattern, which implies that they do not strongly discount future payoffs or anticipate a change in others' behavior at the end. They also do not show a dramatic shift toward defection or toward full cooperation in the final stages, indicating that they do not use the end of the game as a signal to change their strategy.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThis player does not engage in costly punishment or reward, as those mechanisms are not available in the game.

Be aware of this personality as you make decisions.\n<GUIDE STARTS>\n<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a low-level cooperator who contributes a small amount to the public good. Their contribution level is relatively stable over time, but they do not maintain the highest possible contribution throughout the game. They appear to be somewhat risk-averse, as they do not fully free-ride but also do not fully cooperate. They do not exhibit a strong fairness norm in the sense of always matching the maximum contribution, but they do not fully defect either. They seem to follow a 'low but stable' strategy, where they contribute a moderate amount that is less than the maximum but more than zero. They do not adjust their contributions in response to others' actions in a way that would suggest a clear conditional rule, but they do not appear to be a pure defector either. Overall, they seem to be a 'moderate cooperator' who is willing to contribute but not at the highest possible level.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nAs the game approaches its end, this player does not show a clear end-game effect on their strategy. They do not significantly increase or decrease their contributions in the final rounds compared to earlier rounds. They do not appear to escalate cooperation in the last few rounds, suggesting that they do not treat the end of the game as a special case. Instead, they continue to follow a stable, low-to-moderate contribution pattern, which implies that they do not strongly discount future payoffs or anticipate a change in others' behavior at the end. They also do not show a dramatic shift toward defection or toward full cooperation in the final stages, indicating that they do not use the end of the game as a signal to change their strategy.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThis player does not engage in costly punishment or reward, as those mechanisms are not available in the game. They do not appear to adjust their contributions in response to the specific payoff outcomes of other players. Instead, they seem to base their decisions on the overall contribution level of the group rather than on the exact payoffs of individual players. They do not seem to be motivated by a desire to maximize their own payoff relative to others, nor do they appear to be driven by a desire to 'punish' others for low contributions. Their behavior suggests that they are primarily guided by a simple, stable rule: they contribute a moderate amount that is less than the maximum but more than zero, and they do not change this rule in response to others' outcomes.

{"game": "VALIDATION_1_C", "round": 14, "agent": "PARROT", "phase": "contrib", "dt_sec": 2.455790760325423, "prompt_full": "You are playing an online public goods game (PGG). Each round, you are given 20 coins and need to decide how many coins to put into the shared pot (integer from 0 to 20).\nYou will not see others' choices before you decide.\nThe pot is multiplied by 2.0× and split equally among all players.\nYour round payoff is: coins you kept + your equal share of the multiplied pot.\n# YOUR PERSONA\nBelow is a guide of how you are likely to play this game according to your personality. Be aware of this personality as you make decisions.\n<GUIDE STARTS>\n<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a low-level cooperator who contributes a small amount to the public good. Their contribution level is relatively stable over time, but they do not maintain the highest possible contribution throughout the game. They appear to be somewhat risk-averse, as they do not fully free-ride but also do not fully cooperate. They do not exhibit a strong fairness norm in the sense of always matching the maximum contribution, but they do not fully defect either. They seem to follow a 'low but stable' strategy, where they contribute a moderate amount that is less than the maximum but more than zero. They do not adjust their contributions in response to others' actions in a way that would suggest a clear conditional rule, but they do not appear to be a pure defector either. Overall, they seem to be a 'moderate cooperator' who is willing to contribute but not at the highest possible level.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nAs the game approaches its end, this player does not show a clear end-game effect on their strategy. They do not significantly increase or decrease their contributions in the final rounds compared to earlier rounds. They do not appear to escalate cooperation in the last few rounds, suggesting that they do not treat the end of the game as a special case. Instead, they continue to follow a stable, low-to-moderate contribution pattern, which implies that they do not strongly discount future payoffs or anticipate a change in others' behavior at the end. They also do not show a dramatic shift toward defection or toward full cooperation in the final stages, indicating that they do not use the end of the game as a signal to change their strategy.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThis player does not engage in costly punishment or reward, as those mechanisms are not available in the game. They do not appear to adjust their contributions in response to the specific payoff outcomes of other players. Instead, they seem to base their decisions on the overall contribution level of the group rather than on the exact payoffs of individual players. They do not seem to be motivated by a desire to maximize their own payoff relative to others, nor do they appear to be driven by a desire to 'punish' others for low contributions. Their behavior suggests that they are primarily guided by a simple, stable rule: they contribute a moderate amount that is less than the maximum but more than zero, and they do not change this rule in response to others' outcomes. They do not seem to be influenced by the absolute payoffs of others, but rather by the relative contribution levels.\n<GUIDE ENDS>\n# GAME STARTS\nYou will refer to each other by their avatar.

Be aware of this personality as you make decisions.\n<GUIDE STARTS>\n<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a conditional cooperator who contributes a moderate amount to the public good. Their contribution level is relatively stable over time, but they do not maintain the highest possible contribution throughout the game. They appear to be sensitive to the overall contribution level of the group, as they sometimes increase their contribution when others contribute more and sometimes reduce it when others contribute less. They do not exhibit a strong fairness norm in the sense of always matching the maximum contribution, but they do not fully free-ride either. They are willing to bear some risk of being exploited, as they do not always match the highest contributors, but they also do not fully defect. Overall, they seem to follow a 'tit-for-tat' or 'conditional cooperation' strategy, adjusting their behavior in response to the group's average contribution.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nAs the game approaches its end, this player does not show a clear end-game effect on their strategy. They do not significantly increase or decrease their contributions in the final rounds compared to earlier rounds. They do not appear to escalate cooperation in the last few rounds, suggesting that they do not treat the end of the game as a special case. Instead, they continue to follow a stable, conditional pattern, which implies that they do not strongly discount future payoffs or anticipate a change in others' behavior at the end. They also do not show a dramatic shift toward defection or toward full cooperation in the final stages, indicating that they do not use the end of the game as a signal to change their strategy.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThis player does not engage in costly punishment or reward, as those mechanisms are not available in the game. They do not appear to adjust their contributions in response to the specific payoff outcomes of other players. Instead, they seem to base their decisions on the overall contribution level of the group rather than on the exact payoffs of individual players. They do not seem to be motivated by a desire to maximize their own payoff relative to others, nor do they appear to be driven by a desire to 'punish' others for low contributions. Their behavior suggests that they are primarily guided by a simple conditional rule: they contribute more when others contribute more, and they contribute less when others contribute less. They do not seem to be influenced by the absolute payoffs of others, but rather by the relative contribution levels.\n<GUIDE ENDS>\n# GAME STARTS\nYou will refer to each other by their avatar.

{"game": "VALIDATION_1_C", "round": 16, "agent": "CHICK", "phase": "contrib", "dt_sec": 2.5175882403273135, "prompt_full": "You are playing an online public goods game (PGG). Each round, you are given 20 coins and need to decide how many coins to put into the shared pot (integer from 0 to 20).\nYou will not see others' choices before you decide.\nThe pot is multiplied by 2.0× and split equally among all players.\nYour round payoff is: coins you kept + your equal share of the multiplied pot.\n# YOUR PERSONA\nBelow is a guide of how you are likely to play this game according to your personality. Be aware of this personality as you make decisions.\n<GUIDE STARTS>\n<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a conditional cooperator who contributes a moderate amount to the public good. Their contribution level is relatively stable over time, but they do not maintain the highest possible contribution throughout the game. They appear to be sensitive to the overall contribution level of the group, as they sometimes increase their contribution when others contribute more and sometimes reduce it when others contribute less. They do not exhibit a strong fairness norm in the sense of always matching the maximum contribution, but they do not fully free-ride either. They are willing to bear some risk of being exploited, as they do not always match the highest contributors, but they also do not fully defect. Overall, they seem to follow a 'tit-for-tat' or 'conditional cooperation' strategy, adjusting their behavior in response to the group's average contribution.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nAs the game approaches its end, this player does not show a clear end-game effect on their strategy. They do not significantly increase or decrease their contributions in the final rounds compared to earlier rounds. They do not appear to escalate cooperation in the last few rounds, suggesting that they do not treat the end of the game as a special case. Instead, they continue to follow a stable, conditional pattern, which implies that they do not strongly discount future payoffs or anticipate a change in others' behavior at the end. They also do not show a dramatic shift toward defection or toward full cooperation in the final stages, indicating that they do not use the end of the game as a signal to change their strategy.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThis player does not engage in costly punishment or reward, as those mechanisms are not available in the game. They do not appear to adjust their contributions in response to the specific payoff outcomes of other players. Instead, they seem to base their decisions on the overall contribution level of the group rather than on the exact payoffs of individual players. They do not seem to be motivated by a desire to maximize their own payoff relative to others, nor do they appear to be driven by a desire to 'punish' others for low contributions. Their behavior suggests that they are primarily guided by a simple conditional rule: they contribute more when others contribute more, and they contribute less when others contribute less. They do not seem to be influenced by the absolute payoffs of others, but rather by the relative contribution levels.\n<GUIDE ENDS>\n# GAME STARTS\nYou will refer to each other by their avatar.
