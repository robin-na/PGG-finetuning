DOG,,1,VALIDATION_10_C,"Hi everyone, starting with a contribution of 10. Let's see how this goes!","It's the first round, so I will contribute a moderate amount to see how others respond. I'll start with 10 to test the waters.",10,"Following my initial strategy, I will contribute 10 coins to the pot.",,,
COW,,1,VALIDATION_10_C,,"I will start by contributing 0. It's the first round, and I want to see what others do before committing.",0,It's the first round. I'll keep my contribution at 0 to observe others' behavior and avoid being exploited if others contribute little.,,,
WHALE,,1,VALIDATION_10_C,"Hi everyone, contributing 8 to the pot. Let's see how this goes!","It's the first round. I'll contribute a moderate amount to see how others respond. Signaling willingness to cooperate, but not being a complete sucker.",8,"First round, so I'm testing the waters with 8. It is enough to demonstrate willingness to cooperate, without being overly generous and risking exploitation.",,,
DOG,,2,VALIDATION_10_C,"Round 1 was low. Contributing 5 this round, hoping for more from others.","COW contributed nothing and WHALE contributed less than me. Since the total contribution was low, I still benefit from contributing, but I reduce mine to 5 to encourage others.",5,"COW isn't contributing, and WHALE's contribution is fluctuating. I'll lower my contribution to 5 to test the waters again and see if they respond.",,,
COW,,2,VALIDATION_10_C,Continuing with 0 for now to observe.,"I contributed 0 in the last round and received 31 coins. Others contributed a combined 18 coins, resulting in a redistribution of 11.4 coins per person, meaning I didn't lose out by contributing little. I will continue contributing 0 for now to see if others maintain their contributions.",0,"I'm still observing. They complain I'm not contributing, but it's a rational response given the outcomes so far.",,,
WHALE,,2,VALIDATION_10_C,DOG and I seem to be the only contributors. COW isn't helping.,"COW contributed nothing in round 1 and gained the highest payoff. This seems like a free-riding strategy. It is unlikely COW will change this behavior. DOG seems willing to cooperate. I will continue to contribute, but reduce my contribution to test the waters a bit more. I will also hint to DOG that COW is not cooperating.",4,COW is free-riding. DOG is decreasing contribution. Decreasing my contribution to 4.,,,
DOG,,3,VALIDATION_10_C,"COW and WHALE, even small contributions help! I'm putting in 3.","COW is not contributing and Whale is reducing their contribution. I will try a small contribution to show I'm still willing to cooperate, and explicitly ask for more cooperation.",1,Continued lack of contribution from COW and decreasing contribution from WHALE necessitate a minimal contribution of 1 to still benefit from the multiplier.,,,
COW,,3,VALIDATION_10_C,"Still observing, contributions seem to be decreasing.",I'm still observing. They're lowering contributions. I'll remain at 0.,0,"Contributions are falling, and I'm still seeing little incentive to contribute. I'll continue observing.",,,
WHALE,,3,VALIDATION_10_C,COW is clearly free-riding. Contributions are decreasing. I'm contributing just 1.,"COW continues to free-ride and DOG is decreasing their contribution. Since COW isn't cooperating, I anticipate further reduction in contributions. I'll decrease mine to 1, to avoid being exploited, signaling this observation to DOG but without totally abandoning cooperation.",1,"COW is free-riding and overall contributions are declining. Decreasing contribution to 1 to avoid exploitation, while still technically participating.",,,
DOG,,4,VALIDATION_10_C,"COW and WHALE, Since you contribute nothing, I will also contribute nothing.",COW and WHALE are clearly free riding. I will contribute 0 to signal that I will no longer be exploited without reciprocity,0,COW and WHALE are clearly free riding. I will match their behavior and contribute 0.,,,
COW,,4,VALIDATION_10_C,"Let's try to contribute a little more, even just 1 or 2 coins, to increase the total pot.","Contributions are very low. A message might encourage them to contribute a bit more, although I doubt it will significantly change outcomes.",1,Contributions are very low. I will contribute 1 to attempt to increase the pot a small amount.,,,
WHALE,,4,VALIDATION_10_C,I'm done contributing.,"Contributions are minimal, likely due to COW's free-riding. Since further cooperation is unlikely, signaling isn't useful anymore and it would be better to keep my 20.",0,"Given that COW continues to free-ride and DOG has stopped contributing, there's no incentive for further cooperation. It is optimal to maximize my own payoff by keeping all 20 coins.",,,
DOG,,5,VALIDATION_10_C,,COW and WHALE are clearly not cooperating. Continuing to contribute is pointless. I'll remain silent and contribute 0.,0,Continued lack of cooperation from other players. No incentive to contribute.,,,
COW,,5,VALIDATION_10_C,No point in contributing when no one else does.,"Contributing 0, since the others have stopped contributing. It seems pointless to contribute alone.",0,Others have stopped contributing. Continuing to contribute would be pointless.,,,
WHALE,,5,VALIDATION_10_C,,"Since everyone else has stopped contributing, there is no benefit to contributing. I will remain silent to avoid signaling any change in strategy.",0,Everyone else has stopped contributing. No reason to contribute when there is no reciprocity. It is maximized my payoffs to remain with all coins.,,,
DOG,,6,VALIDATION_10_C,,"No cooperation from others, no incentive to contribute in the last round. I am staying silent.",0,"No cooperation from others throughout the game, so no point in contributing in the final round.",,,
COW,,6,VALIDATION_10_C,,"Since everyone has stopped contributing, there's no benefit to contributing in the last round. Maintaining the free-riding strategy maximizes my payoff.",0,Everyone has stopped contributing in the previous rounds. There is no benefit to contributing alone. I'll maintain the free-riding strategy to maximize my payoff in the final round.,,,
WHALE,,6,VALIDATION_10_C,,"Since this is the final round and no cooperation is happening, there is no advantage to contributing or communicating. I remain silent and retain my coins to maximize payoff in this last round.",0,"Since everyone has stopped contributing in previous rounds, there is no benefit to contributing. It is maximized my payoffs to remain with all coins.",,,
