They appear to prioritize group welfare over individual gain, indicating a strong fairness norm and a willingness to bear personal cost for collective benefit. Their contribution is stable and not conditional on others' behavior, suggesting a principled rather than opportunistic approach. They seem to tolerate some free-riding without retaliating, which may reflect a belief in the possibility of future cooperation or a low sensitivity to short-term defection.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThey engage in communication that is generally positive and encouraging, aiming to reinforce cooperation and maintain group harmony.

They respond to others' contributions with appreciation and encouragement, indicating a responsive and socially attuned style.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nAs the game approaches its end, this player maintains their cooperative strategy without significant change. They do not appear to engage in end-game defection or escalation, suggesting a stable, long-term cooperative orientation rather than a last-minute opportunistic shift. Their awareness of the finite horizon does not lead to a breakdown in cooperation, indicating a belief in the value of sustained cooperation even when future interactions are limited.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThis player is reluctant to punish, even when others contribute less than the maximum. They do not impose penalties on free-riders, which may reflect a preference for forgiveness, a desire to avoid conflict, or a belief that cooperation can be maintained through positive reinforcement rather than punishment. They do not use punishment as a deterrent or retaliatory tool, suggesting a more tolerant and trusting disposition.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey are willing to reward others who contribute highly, using the reward mechanism to reinforce cooperative behavior.

Their contribution is stable and not conditional on others' behavior, suggesting that they do not adjust their strategy based on the group's actions. They are willing to take advantage of others' contributions without reciprocating, which reflects a low level of fairness concern and a high tolerance for exploitation. They do not show any signs of increasing contributions in response to others' generosity, indicating a lack of reciprocity or conditional cooperation.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nTheir communication is minimal and non-confrontational. They do not engage in explicit coordination attempts or persuasion, and they do not respond to others' contributions or to calls for cooperation. Their tone is neutral and does not include expressions of gratitude, frustration, or encouragement. They appear to avoid direct engagement with the group, which may reflect a desire to minimize social interaction or a lack of interest in influencing others. They do not use chat to signal their own strategy or to justify their low contributions, suggesting that they are not motivated to explain or defend their behavior.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nAs the game approaches its end, this player continues their low-contribution strategy without any noticeable change. They do not escalate cooperation or attempt to compensate for earlier free-riding, indicating that they do not adjust their behavior based on the remaining rounds. Their horizon awareness does not lead them to increase contributions; instead, they maintain their self-interested pattern, suggesting that they do not value future interactions enough to change their strategy.

They do not use the punishment mechanism at all, which suggests a low willingness to enforce norms or deter free-riding. They do not appear to be motivated by a desire to maintain fairness or to protect the group from exploitation. Their lack of punishment may reflect a belief that others should bear the cost of maintaining cooperation, or it may simply reflect a preference for avoiding the personal cost of punishment. They do not engage in retaliatory punishment, indicating that they do not use punishment as a tool for revenge or deterrence.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey are unwilling to reward others, even when they see high contributors. They do not use the reward mechanism at all, which suggests that they do not see a benefit in reinforcing cooperative behavior through positive incentives. Their lack of reward may reflect a general indifference to social norms or a belief that rewards are unnecessary in a cooperative environment.

They do not engage in excessive punishment, indicating a balance between enforcing norms and avoiding unnecessary conflict.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey are willing to reward high contributors, using the reward mechanism to reinforce cooperative behavior. Their rewards are targeted at those who consistently contribute at or near the maximum level, indicating a desire to encourage and sustain high contributions. They do not reward low contributors, which suggests that they view rewards as a way to reinforce the cooperative norm rather than as a general incentive. Their use of rewards appears strategic, aimed at maintaining group cohesion and encouraging continued cooperation, rather than at signaling gratitude alone.\n<GUIDE ENDS>\n# GAME STARTS\nYou will refer to each other by their avatar.

Be aware of this personality as you make decisions.\n<GUIDE STARTS>\n<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a free-rider who consistently contributes the minimum amount in each round. They appear to prioritize personal gain over group welfare, indicating a strong self-interested orientation. Their contribution is stable and not conditional on others' behavior, suggesting that they do not adjust their strategy based on the group's actions. They are willing to take advantage of others' contributions without reciprocating, which reflects a low level of fairness concern and a high tolerance for exploitation. They do not show any signs of increasing contributions in response to others' generosity, indicating a lack of reciprocity or conditional cooperation.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nTheir communication is minimal and non-confrontational. They do not engage in explicit coordination attempts or persuasion, and they do not respond to others' contributions or to calls for cooperation. Their tone is neutral and does not include expressions of gratitude, frustration, or encouragement. They appear to avoid direct engagement with the group, which may reflect a desire to minimize social interaction or a lack of interest in influencing others. They do not use chat to signal their own strategy or to justify their low contributions, suggesting that they are not motivated to explain or defend their behavior.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nAs the game approaches its end, this player continues their low-contribution strategy without any noticeable change. They do not escalate cooperation or attempt to compensate for earlier free-riding, indicating that they do not adjust their behavior based on the remaining rounds. Their horizon awareness does not lead them to increase contributions; instead, they maintain their self-interested pattern, suggesting that they do not value future interactions enough to change their strategy. They do not show any signs of last-minute cooperation or attempts to improve the group's outcome.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThis player is unwilling to punish others, even when they observe that some players contribute more than the minimum. They do not use the punishment mechanism at all, which suggests a low willingness to enforce norms or deter free-riding. They do not appear to be motivated by a desire to maintain fairness or to protect the group from exploitation. Their lack of punishment may reflect a belief that others should bear the cost of maintaining cooperation, or it may simply reflect a preference for avoiding the personal cost of punishment. They do not engage in retaliatory punishment, indicating that they do not use punishment as a tool for revenge or deterrence.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey are unwilling to reward others, even when they see high contributors. They do not use the reward mechanism at all, which suggests that they do not see a benefit in reinforcing cooperative behavior through positive incentives. Their lack of reward may reflect a general indifference to social norms or a belief that rewards are unnecessary in a cooperative environment. They do not appear to use rewards to encourage others or to signal appreciation, indicating that they do not engage in strategic reinforcement of prosocial behavior.\n<GUIDE ENDS>\n# GAME STARTS\nYou will refer to each other by their avatar.

Be aware of this personality as you make decisions.\n<GUIDE STARTS>\n<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a conditional cooperator who adjusts their contributions based on the group's overall behavior. They tend to contribute more when others are also contributing generously, and they reduce or stop contributing when they perceive that others are free-riding. This suggests a sensitivity to the social context and a desire to maintain a fair balance between personal cost and group benefit. They are willing to bear some personal cost to support the group, but they are not a pure altruist; they appear to monitor the group and adjust their own behavior accordingly.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nTheir communication is strategic and somewhat confrontational. They use chat to express dissatisfaction with low contributors and to encourage higher contributions, indicating a desire to influence group behavior. They are responsive to others' contributions and do not shy away from calling out free-riders, which suggests a normative stance that cooperation is expected and that deviations from this norm are worth addressing. Their tone is firm but not overly aggressive, and they occasionally offer positive reinforcement to those who contribute well, indicating a mix of corrective and supportive communication.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nAs the game nears its end, this player becomes more cautious and less willing to contribute at the maximum level. This suggests a horizon-aware strategy: they are more willing to take risks and invest in the group when future interactions are uncertain. They appear to prioritize short-term gains and self-preservation in the final round, indicating a shift from long-term cooperation to a more self-interested stance. However, they do not completely defect; they still contribute a moderate amount, showing some residual concern for group welfare even in the end game.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThis player is willing to punish free-riders, especially when they perceive that others are not contributing their fair share. They use punishment as a deterrent rather than as a purely retaliatory tool, aiming to maintain group cooperation and fairness. They are selective in their punishment, targeting those who contribute very little while ignoring moderate or high contributors.

Their awareness of the finite horizon does not lead to a breakdown in cooperation, indicating a belief in the value of sustained cooperation even when future interactions are limited.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThis player is reluctant to punish, even when others contribute less than the maximum. They do not impose penalties on free-riders, which may reflect a preference for forgiveness, a desire to avoid conflict, or a belief that cooperation can be maintained through positive reinforcement rather than punishment. They do not use punishment as a deterrent or retaliatory tool, suggesting a more tolerant and trusting disposition.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey are willing to reward others who contribute highly, using the reward mechanism to reinforce cooperative behavior. Their rewards are targeted at high contributors, indicating a strategic intent to encourage and sustain high contributions.

They appear to avoid direct engagement with the group, which may reflect a desire to minimize social interaction or a lack of interest in influencing others. They do not use chat to signal their own strategy or to justify their low contributions, suggesting that they are not motivated to explain or defend their behavior.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nAs the game approaches its end, this player continues their low-contribution strategy without any noticeable change. They do not escalate cooperation or attempt to compensate for earlier free-riding, indicating that they do not adjust their behavior based on the remaining rounds. Their horizon awareness does not lead them to increase contributions; instead, they maintain their self-interested pattern, suggesting that they do not value future interactions enough to change their strategy. They do not show any signs of last-minute cooperation or attempts to improve the group's outcome.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThis player is unwilling to punish others, even when they observe that some players contribute more than the minimum. They do not use the punishment mechanism at all, which suggests a low willingness to enforce norms or deter free-riding. They do not appear to be motivated by a desire to maintain fairness or to protect the group from exploitation. Their lack of punishment may reflect a belief that others should bear the cost of maintaining cooperation, or it may simply reflect a preference for avoiding the personal cost of punishment. They do not engage in retaliatory punishment, indicating that they do not use punishment as a tool for revenge or deterrence.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey are unwilling to reward others, even when they see high contributors. They do not use the reward mechanism at all, which suggests that they do not see a benefit in reinforcing cooperative behavior through positive incentives. Their lack of reward may reflect a general indifference to social norms or a belief that rewards are unnecessary in a cooperative environment. They do not appear to use rewards to encourage others or to signal appreciation, indicating that they do not engage in strategic reinforcement of prosocial behavior.\n<GUIDE ENDS>\n# GAME STARTS\nYou will refer to each other by their avatar.

Be aware of this personality as you make decisions.\n<GUIDE STARTS>\n<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a conditional cooperator who adjusts their contributions based on the group's overall behavior. They tend to contribute more when others are also contributing generously, and they reduce or stop contributing when they perceive that others are free-riding. This suggests a sensitivity to the social context and a desire to maintain a fair balance between personal cost and group benefit. They are willing to bear some personal cost to support the group, but they are not a pure altruist; they appear to monitor the group and adjust their own behavior accordingly.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nTheir communication is strategic and somewhat confrontational. They use chat to express dissatisfaction with low contributors and to encourage higher contributions, indicating a desire to influence group behavior. They are responsive to others' contributions and do not shy away from calling out free-riders, which suggests a normative stance that cooperation is expected and that deviations from this norm are worth addressing. Their tone is firm but not overly aggressive, and they occasionally offer positive reinforcement to those who contribute well, indicating a mix of corrective and supportive communication.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nAs the game nears its end, this player becomes more cautious and less willing to contribute at the maximum level. This suggests a horizon-aware strategy: they are more willing to take risks and invest in the group when future interactions are uncertain. They appear to prioritize short-term gains and self-preservation in the final round, indicating a shift from long-term cooperation to a more self-interested stance. However, they do not completely defect; they still contribute a moderate amount, showing some residual concern for group welfare even in the end game.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThis player is willing to punish free-riders, especially when they perceive that others are not contributing their fair share. They use punishment as a deterrent rather than as a purely retaliatory tool, aiming to maintain group cooperation and fairness. They are selective in their punishment, targeting those who contribute very little while ignoring moderate or high contributors. This suggests a belief that punishment should be reserved for clear violations of the cooperative norm rather than used as a general threat. They do not engage in excessive punishment, indicating a balance between enforcing norms and avoiding unnecessary conflict.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey are willing to reward high contributors, using the reward mechanism to reinforce cooperative behavior. Their rewards are targeted at those who consistently contribute at or near the maximum level, indicating a desire to encourage and sustain high contributions. They do not reward low contributors, which suggests that they view rewards as a way to reinforce the cooperative norm rather than as a general incentive. Their use of rewards appears strategic, aimed at maintaining group cohesion and encouraging continued cooperation, rather than at signaling gratitude alone.\n<GUIDE ENDS>\n# GAME STARTS\nYou will refer to each other by their avatar.

They appear to prioritize group welfare over individual gain, indicating a strong fairness norm and a willingness to bear personal cost for collective benefit.

They do not appear to engage in end-game defection or escalation, suggesting a stable, long-term cooperative orientation rather than a last-minute opportunistic shift. Their awareness of the finite horizon does not lead to a breakdown in cooperation, indicating a belief in the value of sustained cooperation even when future interactions are limited.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThis player is reluctant to punish, even when others contribute less than the maximum. They do not impose penalties on free-riders, which may reflect a preference for forgiveness, a desire to avoid conflict, or a belief that cooperation can be maintained through positive reinforcement rather than punishment. They do not use punishment as a deterrent or retaliatory tool, suggesting a more tolerant and trusting disposition.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey are willing to reward others who contribute highly, using the reward mechanism to reinforce cooperative behavior. Their rewards are targeted at high contributors, indicating a strategic intent to encourage and sustain high contributions.

They do not use chat to signal their own strategy or to justify their low contributions, suggesting that they are not motivated to explain or defend their behavior.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nAs the game approaches its end, this player continues their low-contribution strategy without any noticeable change. They do not escalate cooperation or attempt to compensate for earlier free-riding, indicating that they do not adjust their behavior based on the remaining rounds. Their horizon awareness does not lead them to increase contributions; instead, they maintain their self-interested pattern, suggesting that they do not value future interactions enough to change their strategy. They do not show any signs of last-minute cooperation or attempts to improve the group's outcome.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThis player is unwilling to punish others, even when they observe that some players contribute more than the minimum. They do not use the punishment mechanism at all, which suggests a low willingness to enforce norms or deter free-riding. They do not appear to be motivated by a desire to maintain fairness or to protect the group from exploitation. Their lack of punishment may reflect a belief that others should bear the cost of maintaining cooperation, or it may simply reflect a preference for avoiding the personal cost of punishment. They do not engage in retaliatory punishment, indicating that they do not use punishment as a tool for revenge or deterrence.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey are unwilling to reward others, even when they see high contributors. They do not use the reward mechanism at all, which suggests that they do not see a benefit in reinforcing cooperative behavior through positive incentives. Their lack of reward may reflect a general indifference to social norms or a belief that rewards are unnecessary in a cooperative environment. They do not appear to use rewards to encourage others or to signal appreciation, indicating that they do not engage in strategic reinforcement of prosocial behavior.\n<GUIDE ENDS>\n# GAME STARTS\nYou will refer to each other by their avatar.

Be aware of this personality as you make decisions.\n<GUIDE STARTS>\n<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a conditional cooperator who adjusts their contributions based on the group's overall behavior. They tend to contribute more when others are also contributing generously, and they reduce or stop contributing when they perceive that others are free-riding. This suggests a sensitivity to the social context and a desire to maintain a fair balance between personal cost and group benefit. They are willing to bear some personal cost to support the group, but they are not a pure altruist; they appear to monitor the group and adjust their own behavior accordingly.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nTheir communication is strategic and somewhat confrontational. They use chat to express dissatisfaction with low contributors and to encourage higher contributions, indicating a desire to influence group behavior. They are responsive to others' contributions and do not shy away from calling out free-riders, which suggests a normative stance that cooperation is expected and that deviations from this norm are worth addressing. Their tone is firm but not overly aggressive, and they occasionally offer positive reinforcement to those who contribute well, indicating a mix of corrective and supportive communication.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nAs the game nears its end, this player becomes more cautious and less willing to contribute at the maximum level. This suggests a horizon-aware strategy: they are more willing to take risks and invest in the group when future interactions are uncertain. They appear to prioritize short-term gains and self-preservation in the final round, indicating a shift from long-term cooperation to a more self-interested stance. However, they do not completely defect; they still contribute a moderate amount, showing some residual concern for group welfare even in the end game.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThis player is willing to punish free-riders, especially when they perceive that others are not contributing their fair share. They use punishment as a deterrent rather than as a purely retaliatory tool, aiming to maintain group cooperation and fairness. They are selective in their punishment, targeting those who contribute very little while ignoring moderate or high contributors. This suggests a belief that punishment should be reserved for clear violations of the cooperative norm rather than used as a general threat. They do not engage in excessive punishment, indicating a balance between enforcing norms and avoiding unnecessary conflict.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey are willing to reward high contributors, using the reward mechanism to reinforce cooperative behavior. Their rewards are targeted at those who consistently contribute at or near the maximum level, indicating a desire to encourage and sustain high contributions. They do not reward low contributors, which suggests that they view rewards as a way to reinforce the cooperative norm rather than as a general incentive. Their use of rewards appears strategic, aimed at maintaining group cohesion and encouraging continued cooperation, rather than at signaling gratitude alone.\n<GUIDE ENDS>\n# GAME STARTS\nYou will refer to each other by their avatar.

They do not impose penalties on free-riders, which may reflect a preference for forgiveness, a desire to avoid conflict, or a belief that cooperation can be maintained through positive reinforcement rather than punishment.

Be aware of this personality as you make decisions.\n<GUIDE STARTS>\n<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a free-rider who consistently contributes the minimum amount in each round. They appear to prioritize personal gain over group welfare, indicating a strong self-interested orientation. Their contribution is stable and not conditional on others' behavior, suggesting that they do not adjust their strategy based on the group's actions. They are willing to take advantage of others' contributions without reciprocating, which reflects a low level of fairness concern and a high tolerance for exploitation. They do not show any signs of increasing contributions in response to others' generosity, indicating a lack of reciprocity or conditional cooperation.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nTheir communication is minimal and non-confrontational. They do not engage in explicit coordination attempts or persuasion, and they do not respond to others' contributions or to calls for cooperation. Their tone is neutral and does not include expressions of gratitude, frustration, or encouragement. They appear to avoid direct engagement with the group, which may reflect a desire to minimize social interaction or a lack of interest in influencing others. They do not use chat to signal their own strategy or to justify their low contributions, suggesting that they are not motivated to explain or defend their behavior.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nAs the game approaches its end, this player continues their low-contribution strategy without any noticeable change. They do not escalate cooperation or attempt to compensate for earlier free-riding, indicating that they do not adjust their behavior based on the remaining rounds. Their horizon awareness does not lead them to increase contributions; instead, they maintain their self-interested pattern, suggesting that they do not value future interactions enough to change their strategy. They do not show any signs of last-minute cooperation or attempts to improve the group's outcome.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThis player is unwilling to punish others, even when they observe that some players contribute more than the minimum. They do not use the punishment mechanism at all, which suggests a low willingness to enforce norms or deter free-riding. They do not appear to be motivated by a desire to maintain fairness or to protect the group from exploitation. Their lack of punishment may reflect a belief that others should bear the cost of maintaining cooperation, or it may simply reflect a preference for avoiding the personal cost of punishment. They do not engage in retaliatory punishment, indicating that they do not use punishment as a tool for revenge or deterrence.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey are unwilling to reward others, even when they see high contributors. They do not use the reward mechanism at all, which suggests that they do not see a benefit in reinforcing cooperative behavior through positive incentives. Their lack of reward may reflect a general indifference to social norms or a belief that rewards are unnecessary in a cooperative environment. They do not appear to use rewards to encourage others or to signal appreciation, indicating that they do not engage in strategic reinforcement of prosocial behavior.\n<GUIDE ENDS>\n# GAME STARTS\nYou will refer to each other by their avatar.

Be aware of this personality as you make decisions.\n<GUIDE STARTS>\n<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a conditional cooperator who adjusts their contributions based on the group's overall behavior. They tend to contribute more when others are also contributing generously, and they reduce or stop contributing when they perceive that others are free-riding. This suggests a sensitivity to the social context and a desire to maintain a fair balance between personal cost and group benefit. They are willing to bear some personal cost to support the group, but they are not a pure altruist; they appear to monitor the group and adjust their own behavior accordingly.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nTheir communication is strategic and somewhat confrontational. They use chat to express dissatisfaction with low contributors and to encourage higher contributions, indicating a desire to influence group behavior. They are responsive to others' contributions and do not shy away from calling out free-riders, which suggests a normative stance that cooperation is expected and that deviations from this norm are worth addressing. Their tone is firm but not overly aggressive, and they occasionally offer positive reinforcement to those who contribute well, indicating a mix of corrective and supportive communication.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nAs the game nears its end, this player becomes more cautious and less willing to contribute at the maximum level. This suggests a horizon-aware strategy: they are more willing to take risks and invest in the group when future interactions are uncertain. They appear to prioritize short-term gains and self-preservation in the final round, indicating a shift from long-term cooperation to a more self-interested stance. However, they do not completely defect; they still contribute a moderate amount, showing some residual concern for group welfare even in the end game.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThis player is willing to punish free-riders, especially when they perceive that others are not contributing their fair share. They use punishment as a deterrent rather than as a purely retaliatory tool, aiming to maintain group cooperation and fairness. They are selective in their punishment, targeting those who contribute very little while ignoring moderate or high contributors. This suggests a belief that punishment should be reserved for clear violations of the cooperative norm rather than used as a general threat. They do not engage in excessive punishment, indicating a balance between enforcing norms and avoiding unnecessary conflict.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey are willing to reward high contributors, using the reward mechanism to reinforce cooperative behavior. Their rewards are targeted at those who consistently contribute at or near the maximum level, indicating a desire to encourage and sustain high contributions. They do not reward low contributors, which suggests that they view rewards as a way to reinforce the cooperative norm rather than as a general incentive. Their use of rewards appears strategic, aimed at maintaining group cohesion and encouraging continued cooperation, rather than at signaling gratitude alone.\n<GUIDE ENDS>\n# GAME STARTS\nYou will refer to each other by their avatar.

They do not impose penalties on free-riders, which may reflect a preference for forgiveness, a desire to avoid conflict, or a belief that cooperation can be maintained through positive reinforcement rather than punishment.

Be aware of this personality as you make decisions.\n<GUIDE STARTS>\n<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a conditional cooperator who adjusts their contributions based on the group's overall behavior. They tend to contribute more when others are also contributing generously, and they reduce or stop contributing when they perceive that others are free-riding. This suggests a sensitivity to the social context and a desire to maintain a fair balance between personal cost and group benefit. They are willing to bear some personal cost to support the group, but they are not a pure altruist; they appear to monitor the group and adjust their own behavior accordingly.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nTheir communication is strategic and somewhat confrontational. They use chat to express dissatisfaction with low contributors and to encourage higher contributions, indicating a desire to influence group behavior. They are responsive to others' contributions and do not shy away from calling out free-riders, which suggests a normative stance that cooperation is expected and that deviations from this norm are worth addressing. Their tone is firm but not overly aggressive, and they occasionally offer positive reinforcement to those who contribute well, indicating a mix of corrective and supportive communication.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nAs the game nears its end, this player becomes more cautious and less willing to contribute at the maximum level. This suggests a horizon-aware strategy: they are more willing to take risks and invest in the group when future interactions are uncertain. They appear to prioritize short-term gains and self-preservation in the final round, indicating a shift from long-term cooperation to a more self-interested stance. However, they do not completely defect; they still contribute a moderate amount, showing some residual concern for group welfare even in the end game.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThis player is willing to punish free-riders, especially when they perceive that others are not contributing their fair share. They use punishment as a deterrent rather than as a purely retaliatory tool, aiming to maintain group cooperation and fairness. They are selective in their punishment, targeting those who contribute very little while ignoring moderate or high contributors. This suggests a belief that punishment should be reserved for clear violations of the cooperative norm rather than used as a general threat. They do not engage in excessive punishment, indicating a balance between enforcing norms and avoiding unnecessary conflict.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey are willing to reward high contributors, using the reward mechanism to reinforce cooperative behavior. Their rewards are targeted at those who consistently contribute at or near the maximum level, indicating a desire to encourage and sustain high contributions. They do not reward low contributors, which suggests that they view rewards as a way to reinforce the cooperative norm rather than as a general incentive. Their use of rewards appears strategic, aimed at maintaining group cohesion and encouraging continued cooperation, rather than at signaling gratitude alone.\n<GUIDE ENDS>\n# GAME STARTS\nYou will refer to each other by their avatar.

They appear to prioritize personal gain over group welfare, indicating a strong self-interested orientation. Their contribution is stable and not conditional on others' behavior, suggesting that they do not adjust their strategy based on the group's actions. They are willing to take advantage of others' contributions without reciprocating, which reflects a low level of fairness concern and a high tolerance for exploitation. They do not show any signs of increasing contributions in response to others' generosity, indicating a lack of reciprocity or conditional cooperation.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nTheir communication is minimal and non-confrontational. They do not engage in explicit coordination attempts or persuasion, and they do not respond to others' contributions or to calls for cooperation. Their tone is neutral and does not include expressions of gratitude, frustration, or encouragement. They appear to avoid direct engagement with the group, which may reflect a desire to minimize social interaction or a lack of interest in influencing others. They do not use chat to signal their own strategy or to justify their low contributions, suggesting that they are not motivated to explain or defend their behavior.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nAs the game approaches its end, this player continues their low-contribution strategy without any noticeable change. They do not escalate cooperation or attempt to compensate for earlier free-riding, indicating that they do not adjust their behavior based on the remaining rounds. Their horizon awareness does not lead them to increase contributions; instead, they maintain their self-interested pattern, suggesting that they do not value future interactions enough to change their strategy. They do not show any signs of last-minute cooperation or attempts to improve the group's outcome.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThis player is unwilling to punish others, even when they observe that some players contribute more than the minimum. They do not use the punishment mechanism at all, which suggests a low willingness to enforce norms or deter free-riding. They do not appear to be motivated by a desire to maintain fairness or to protect the group from exploitation. Their lack of punishment may reflect a belief that others should bear the cost of maintaining cooperation, or it may simply reflect a preference for avoiding the personal cost of punishment. They do not engage in retaliatory punishment, indicating that they do not use punishment as a tool for revenge or deterrence.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey are unwilling to reward others, even when they see high contributors. They do not use the reward mechanism at all, which suggests that they do not see a benefit in reinforcing cooperative behavior through positive incentives. Their lack of reward may reflect a general indifference to social norms or a belief that rewards are unnecessary in a cooperative environment. They do not appear to use rewards to encourage others or to signal appreciation, indicating that they do not engage in strategic reinforcement of prosocial behavior.\n<GUIDE ENDS>\n# GAME STARTS\nYou will refer to each other by their avatar.
