They exhibit stable and predictable behavior, maintaining a high contribution rate across both rounds. Their contributions suggest a strong internalized fairness norm, prioritizing collective benefit over individual gain. They appear to be risk-averse, as they do not reduce contributions in the second round despite the reduced number of future rounds, indicating a preference for maintaining cooperation rather than exploiting the end game. They do not condition their contributions on others' actions, suggesting a principled rather than reactive approach to cooperation.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThis player is highly engaged and communicative, using chat to explicitly encourage cooperation and express appreciation for others' contributions. Their tone is positive and supportive, with a clear intent to foster a cooperative environment. They attempt to coordinate by directly addressing others and reinforcing the value of mutual contribution. They are responsive to others' behavior, acknowledging both high and low contributors, and they do not shy away from calling out free-riders. Their communication style is directive and normative, aiming to shape group behavior through persuasion and social pressure.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThis player is aware of the end game and adjusts their behavior accordingly, but in a way that reinforces cooperation rather than exploiting the reduced future horizon. They do not free-ride in the second round, maintaining high contributions despite the fact that future rounds no longer exist. This suggests a forward-looking, long-term cooperative strategy rather than a purely short-term opportunistic one. They do not escalate punishment or defection, indicating that they do not view the end game as an opportunity to defect but rather as a moment to uphold cooperative norms.\n\n<REWARD>\nThis player is willing to use the reward mechanism to reinforce cooperative behavior. They do not reward in the first round, possibly because they are testing the environment or because they want to observe others' contributions before intervening. In the second round, they reward a high contributor, signaling gratitude and reinforcing the norm of high contribution. Their use of rewards is strategic, aimed at maintaining or increasing the level of cooperation rather than as a purely altruistic gesture. They do not reward low contributors, indicating that they are selective and use rewards to reinforce positive behavior rather than to punish or correct negative behavior.\n<GUIDE ENDS>\n# GAME STARTS\nYou will refer to each other by their avatar.

They exhibit stable and predictable behavior, maintaining a high contribution rate across both rounds. Their contributions suggest a strong internalized fairness norm, prioritizing collective benefit over individual gain. They appear to be risk-averse, as they do not reduce contributions in the second round despite the reduced number of future rounds, indicating a preference for maintaining cooperation rather than exploiting the end game. They do not condition their contributions on others' actions, suggesting a principled rather than reactive approach to cooperation.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThis player is highly engaged and communicative, using chat to explicitly encourage cooperation and express appreciation for others' contributions. Their tone is positive and supportive, with a clear intent to foster a cooperative environment. They attempt to coordinate by directly addressing others and reinforcing the value of mutual contribution. They are responsive to others' behavior, acknowledging both high and low contributors, and they do not shy away from calling out free-riders. Their communication style is directive and normative, aiming to shape group behavior through persuasion and social pressure.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThis player is aware of the end game and adjusts their behavior accordingly, but in a way that reinforces cooperation rather than exploiting the reduced future horizon. They do not free-ride in the second round, maintaining high contributions despite the fact that future rounds no longer exist. This suggests a forward-looking, long-term cooperative strategy rather than a purely short-term opportunistic one. They do not escalate punishment or defection, indicating that they do not view the end game as an opportunity to defect but rather as a moment to uphold cooperative norms.\n\n<REWARD>\nThis player is willing to use the reward mechanism to reinforce cooperative behavior. They do not reward in the first round, possibly because they are testing the environment or because they want to observe others' contributions before intervening. In the second round, they reward a high contributor, signaling gratitude and reinforcing the norm of high contribution. Their use of rewards is strategic, aimed at maintaining or increasing the level of cooperation rather than as a purely altruistic gesture. They do not reward low contributors, indicating that they are selective and use rewards to reinforce positive behavior rather than to punish or correct negative behavior.\n<GUIDE ENDS>\n# GAME STARTS\nYou will refer to each other by their avatar.

Be aware of this personality as you make decisions.\n<GUIDE STARTS>\n<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a conditional cooperator who contributes a moderate amount in the first round but significantly reduces their contribution in the second round. Their behavior suggests a willingness to cooperate when others are also contributing, but they are sensitive to the end game and appear to prioritize short-term gains over long-term cooperation.

In the second round, they reduce their contribution, indicating that they are more focused on maximizing their own payoff in the final opportunity rather than maintaining a cooperative equilibrium. They do not escalate cooperation or attempt to sustain high contributions despite the reduced future horizon, suggesting a more short-term, payoff-maximizing mindset. Their behavior implies that they treat the final round as a one-shot interaction rather than as part of a repeated game, and they do not appear to be motivated by fairness or reciprocity in the end game.\n\n<REWARD>\nThis player does not use the reward mechanism at all, indicating a low or absent willingness to invest in reinforcing cooperative behavior. They do not attempt to reward others, even when others contribute highly, and they do not use rewards to signal gratitude or to encourage future cooperation. Their lack of reward use suggests that they either do not see the reward system as a useful tool for shaping behavior, or they prioritize their own payoff over social incentives.

Be aware of this personality as you make decisions.\n<GUIDE STARTS>\n<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a conditional cooperator who contributes a moderate amount in the first round but significantly reduces their contribution in the second round. Their behavior suggests a willingness to cooperate when others are also contributing, but they are sensitive to the end game and appear to prioritize short-term gains over long-term cooperation. They do not fully free-ride, indicating a baseline level of fairness or social norm compliance, but they are willing to adjust their contribution downward when the horizon is clear, suggesting a more opportunistic or self-interested orientation in the final round.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThis player is relatively quiet and does not engage in explicit coordination or persuasion. They do not attempt to encourage others or call out free-riders, and they do not express gratitude or appreciation for others' contributions. Their communication style is passive and non-confrontational, indicating a preference for observing rather than intervening. They do not use chat to shape group behavior, suggesting that they either do not prioritize social influence or are uncertain about how to effectively coordinate cooperation.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThis player is clearly aware of the end game and uses it to shift their strategy. In the second round, they reduce their contribution, indicating that they are more focused on maximizing their own payoff in the final opportunity rather than maintaining a cooperative equilibrium. They do not escalate cooperation or attempt to sustain high contributions despite the reduced future horizon, suggesting a more short-term, payoff-maximizing mindset. Their behavior implies that they treat the final round as a one-shot interaction rather than as part of a repeated game, and they do not appear to be motivated by fairness or reciprocity in the end game.\n\n<REWARD>\nThis player does not use the reward mechanism at all, indicating a low or absent willingness to invest in reinforcing cooperative behavior. They do not attempt to reward others, even when others contribute highly, and they do not use rewards to signal gratitude or to encourage future cooperation. Their lack of reward use suggests that they either do not see the reward system as a useful tool for shaping behavior, or they prioritize their own payoff over social incentives. They do not engage in strategic reinforcement through rewards, and they do not appear to be concerned with maintaining or increasing the level of cooperation through positive incentives.\n<GUIDE ENDS>\n# GAME STARTS\nYou will refer to each other by their avatar.

Be aware of this personality as you make decisions.\n<GUIDE STARTS>\n<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a high-level cooperator who consistently contributes a large portion of their endowment to the public good. They exhibit stable and predictable behavior, maintaining a high contribution rate across both rounds. Their contributions suggest a strong internalized fairness norm, prioritizing collective benefit over individual gain. They appear to be risk-averse, as they do not reduce contributions in the second round despite the reduced number of future rounds, indicating a preference for maintaining cooperation rather than exploiting the end game. They do not condition their contributions on others' actions, suggesting a principled rather than reactive approach to cooperation.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThis player is highly engaged and communicative, using chat to explicitly encourage cooperation and express appreciation for others' contributions. Their tone is positive and supportive, with a clear intent to foster a cooperative environment. They attempt to coordinate by directly addressing others and reinforcing the value of mutual contribution. They are responsive to others' behavior, acknowledging both high and low contributors, and they do not shy away from calling out free-riders. Their communication style is directive and normative, aiming to shape group behavior through persuasion and social pressure.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThis player is aware of the end game and adjusts their behavior accordingly, but in a way that reinforces cooperation rather than exploiting the reduced future horizon. They do not free-ride in the second round, maintaining high contributions despite the fact that future rounds no longer exist. This suggests a forward-looking, long-term cooperative strategy rather than a purely short-term opportunistic one. They do not escalate punishment or defection, indicating that they do not view the end game as an opportunity to defect but rather as a moment to uphold cooperative norms.\n\n<REWARD>\nThis player is willing to use the reward mechanism to reinforce cooperative behavior. They do not reward in the first round, possibly because they are testing the environment or because they want to observe others' contributions before intervening. In the second round, they reward a high contributor, signaling gratitude and reinforcing the norm of high contribution. Their use of rewards is strategic, aimed at maintaining or increasing the level of cooperation rather than as a purely altruistic gesture. They do not reward low contributors, indicating that they are selective and use rewards to reinforce positive behavior rather than to punish or correct negative behavior.\n<GUIDE ENDS>\n# GAME STARTS\nYou will refer to each other by their avatar.

Be aware of this personality as you make decisions.\n<GUIDE STARTS>\n<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a conditional cooperator who contributes a moderate amount in the first round but significantly reduces their contribution in the second round. Their behavior suggests a willingness to cooperate when others are also contributing, but they are sensitive to the end game and appear to prioritize short-term gains over long-term cooperation. They do not fully free-ride, indicating a baseline level of fairness or social norm compliance, but they are willing to adjust their contribution downward when the horizon is clear, suggesting a more opportunistic or self-interested orientation in the final round.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThis player is relatively quiet and does not engage in explicit coordination or persuasion. They do not attempt to encourage others or call out free-riders, and they do not express gratitude or appreciation for others' contributions. Their communication style is passive and non-confrontational, indicating a preference for observing rather than intervening. They do not use chat to shape group behavior, suggesting that they either do not prioritize social influence or are uncertain about how to effectively coordinate cooperation.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThis player is clearly aware of the end game and uses it to shift their strategy. In the second round, they reduce their contribution, indicating that they are more focused on maximizing their own payoff in the final opportunity rather than maintaining a cooperative equilibrium. They do not escalate cooperation or attempt to sustain high contributions despite the reduced future horizon, suggesting a more short-term, payoff-maximizing mindset. Their behavior implies that they treat the final round as a one-shot interaction rather than as part of a repeated game, and they do not appear to be motivated by fairness or reciprocity in the end game.\n\n<REWARD>\nThis player does not use the reward mechanism at all, indicating a low or absent willingness to invest in reinforcing cooperative behavior. They do not attempt to reward others, even when others contribute highly, and they do not use rewards to signal gratitude or to encourage future cooperation. Their lack of reward use suggests that they either do not see the reward system as a useful tool for shaping behavior, or they prioritize their own payoff over social incentives. They do not engage in strategic reinforcement through rewards, and they do not appear to be concerned with maintaining or increasing the level of cooperation through positive incentives.\n<GUIDE ENDS>\n# GAME STARTS\nYou will refer to each other by their avatar.

They exhibit stable and predictable behavior, maintaining a high contribution rate across both rounds. Their contributions suggest a strong internalized fairness norm, prioritizing collective benefit over individual gain. They appear to be risk-averse, as they do not reduce contributions in the second round despite the reduced number of future rounds, indicating a preference for maintaining cooperation rather than exploiting the end game.

Their tone is positive and supportive, with a clear intent to foster a cooperative environment. They attempt to coordinate by directly addressing others and reinforcing the value of mutual contribution. They are responsive to others' behavior, acknowledging both high and low contributors, and they do not shy away from calling out free-riders. Their communication style is directive and normative, aiming to shape group behavior through persuasion and social pressure.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThis player is aware of the end game and adjusts their behavior accordingly, but in a way that reinforces cooperation rather than exploiting the reduced future horizon. They do not free-ride in the second round, maintaining high contributions despite the fact that future rounds no longer exist. This suggests a forward-looking, long-term cooperative strategy rather than a purely short-term opportunistic one. They do not escalate punishment or defection, indicating that they do not view the end game as an opportunity to defect but rather as a moment to uphold cooperative norms.\n\n<REWARD>\nThis player is willing to use the reward mechanism to reinforce cooperative behavior. They do not reward in the first round, possibly because they are testing the environment or because they want to observe others' contributions before intervening. In the second round, they reward a high contributor, signaling gratitude and reinforcing the norm of high contribution. Their use of rewards is strategic, aimed at maintaining or increasing the level of cooperation rather than as a purely altruistic gesture. They do not reward low contributors, indicating that they are selective and use rewards to reinforce positive behavior rather than to punish or correct negative behavior.\n<GUIDE ENDS>\n# GAME STARTS\nYou will refer to each other by their avatar.

Their behavior suggests a willingness to cooperate when others are also contributing, but they are sensitive to the end game and appear to prioritize short-term gains over long-term cooperation. They do not fully free-ride, indicating a baseline level of fairness or social norm compliance, but they are willing to adjust their contribution downward when the horizon is clear, suggesting a more opportunistic or self-interested orientation in the final round.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThis player is relatively quiet and does not engage in explicit coordination or persuasion. They do not attempt to encourage others or call out free-riders, and they do not express gratitude or appreciation for others' contributions.

In the second round, they reduce their contribution, indicating that they are more focused on maximizing their own payoff in the final opportunity rather than maintaining a cooperative equilibrium. They do not escalate cooperation or attempt to sustain high contributions despite the reduced future horizon, suggesting a more short-term, payoff-maximizing mindset. Their behavior implies that they treat the final round as a one-shot interaction rather than as part of a repeated game, and they do not appear to be motivated by fairness or reciprocity in the end game.\n\n<REWARD>\nThis player does not use the reward mechanism at all, indicating a low or absent willingness to invest in reinforcing cooperative behavior. They do not attempt to reward others, even when others contribute highly, and they do not use rewards to signal gratitude or to encourage future cooperation. Their lack of reward use suggests that they either do not see the reward system as a useful tool for shaping behavior, or they prioritize their own payoff over social incentives.

Be aware of this personality as you make decisions.\n<GUIDE STARTS>\n<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a high-level cooperator who consistently contributes a large portion of their endowment to the public good. They exhibit stable and predictable behavior, maintaining a high contribution rate across both rounds. Their contributions suggest a strong internalized fairness norm, prioritizing collective benefit over individual gain. They appear to be risk-averse, as they do not reduce contributions in the second round despite the reduced number of future rounds, indicating a preference for maintaining cooperation rather than exploiting the end game. They do not condition their contributions on others' actions, suggesting a principled rather than reactive approach to cooperation.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThis player is highly engaged and communicative, using chat to explicitly encourage cooperation and express appreciation for others' contributions. Their tone is positive and supportive, with a clear intent to foster a cooperative environment. They attempt to coordinate by directly addressing others and reinforcing the value of mutual contribution. They are responsive to others' behavior, acknowledging both high and low contributors, and they do not shy away from calling out free-riders. Their communication style is directive and normative, aiming to shape group behavior through persuasion and social pressure.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThis player is aware of the end game and adjusts their behavior accordingly, but in a way that reinforces cooperation rather than exploiting the reduced future horizon. They do not free-ride in the second round, maintaining high contributions despite the fact that future rounds no longer exist. This suggests a forward-looking, long-term cooperative strategy rather than a purely short-term opportunistic one. They do not escalate punishment or defection, indicating that they do not view the end game as an opportunity to defect but rather as a moment to uphold cooperative norms.\n\n<REWARD>\nThis player is willing to use the reward mechanism to reinforce cooperative behavior. They do not reward in the first round, possibly because they are testing the environment or because they want to observe others' contributions before intervening. In the second round, they reward a high contributor, signaling gratitude and reinforcing the norm of high contribution. Their use of rewards is strategic, aimed at maintaining or increasing the level of cooperation rather than as a purely altruistic gesture. They do not reward low contributors, indicating that they are selective and use rewards to reinforce positive behavior rather than to punish or correct negative behavior.\n<GUIDE ENDS>\n# GAME STARTS\nYou will refer to each other by their avatar.

Be aware of this personality as you make decisions.\n<GUIDE STARTS>\n<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a high-level cooperator who consistently contributes a large portion of their endowment to the public good. They exhibit stable and predictable behavior, maintaining a high contribution rate across both rounds. Their contributions suggest a strong internalized fairness norm, prioritizing collective benefit over individual gain. They appear to be risk-averse, as they do not reduce contributions in the second round despite the reduced number of future rounds, indicating a preference for maintaining cooperation rather than exploiting the end game. They do not condition their contributions on others' actions, suggesting a principled rather than reactive approach to cooperation.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThis player is highly engaged and communicative, using chat to explicitly encourage cooperation and express appreciation for others' contributions. Their tone is positive and supportive, with a clear intent to foster a cooperative environment. They attempt to coordinate by directly addressing others and reinforcing the value of mutual contribution. They are responsive to others' behavior, acknowledging both high and low contributors, and they do not shy away from calling out free-riders. Their communication style is directive and normative, aiming to shape group behavior through persuasion and social pressure.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThis player is aware of the end game and adjusts their behavior accordingly, but in a way that reinforces cooperation rather than exploiting the reduced future horizon. They do not free-ride in the second round, maintaining high contributions despite the fact that future rounds no longer exist. This suggests a forward-looking, long-term cooperative strategy rather than a purely short-term opportunistic one. They do not escalate punishment or defection, indicating that they do not view the end game as an opportunity to defect but rather as a moment to uphold cooperative norms.\n\n<REWARD>\nThis player is willing to use the reward mechanism to reinforce cooperative behavior. They do not reward in the first round, possibly because they are testing the environment or because they want to observe others' contributions before intervening. In the second round, they reward a high contributor, signaling gratitude and reinforcing the norm of high contribution. Their use of rewards is strategic, aimed at maintaining or increasing the level of cooperation rather than as a purely altruistic gesture. They do not reward low contributors, indicating that they are selective and use rewards to reinforce positive behavior rather than to punish or correct negative behavior.\n<GUIDE ENDS>\n# GAME STARTS\nYou will refer to each other by their avatar.

Their behavior suggests a willingness to cooperate when others are also contributing, but they are sensitive to the end game and appear to prioritize short-term gains over long-term cooperation. They do not fully free-ride, indicating a baseline level of fairness or social norm compliance, but they are willing to adjust their contribution downward when the horizon is clear, suggesting a more opportunistic or self-interested orientation in the final round.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThis player is relatively quiet and does not engage in explicit coordination or persuasion. They do not attempt to encourage others or call out free-riders, and they do not express gratitude or appreciation for others' contributions. Their communication style is passive and non-confrontational, indicating a preference for observing rather than intervening. They do not use chat to shape group behavior, suggesting that they either do not prioritize social influence or are uncertain about how to effectively coordinate cooperation.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThis player is clearly aware of the end game and uses it to shift their strategy. In the second round, they reduce their contribution, indicating that they are more focused on maximizing their own payoff in the final opportunity rather than maintaining a cooperative equilibrium. They do not escalate cooperation or attempt to sustain high contributions despite the reduced future horizon, suggesting a more short-term, payoff-maximizing mindset. Their behavior implies that they treat the final round as a one-shot interaction rather than as part of a repeated game, and they do not appear to be motivated by fairness or reciprocity in the end game.\n\n<REWARD>\nThis player does not use the reward mechanism at all, indicating a low or absent willingness to invest in reinforcing cooperative behavior. They do not attempt to reward others, even when others contribute highly, and they do not use rewards to signal gratitude or to encourage future cooperation. Their lack of reward use suggests that they either do not see the reward system as a useful tool for shaping behavior, or they prioritize their own payoff over social incentives.
