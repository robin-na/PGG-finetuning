WALRUS,66fwGpKjnAsFzeYNF,1,VALIDATION_10_T,Let's all contribute all 20 coins.,"I consistently contributed everything in previous rounds, and others reliably did too. Let's continue that pattern.",20,"I consistently contributed all 20 coins in the previous game, and others also did. I'll continue that strategy here.",{},,I did not punish anyone by habit as observed from previous games.
COW,tzchBXWXFEM24tovy,1,VALIDATION_10_T,Let's see how this plays out.,I'm starting by contributing a moderate amount. I'd like to see what the others will do before being fully cooperative or completely free-riding.,10,I'm starting with 10 coins. I want to observe the others' behavior before committing more or less.,{},,I'm not punishing anyone at the moment. I'm willing to give everyone the benefit of the doubt this round.
GORILLA,FTEYxrx6YDF8T2gSH,1,VALIDATION_10_T,,"I will start cooperative, to see what others do.",20,"I will contribute 20 coins.  I previously started by being cooperative and contributing everything. I'll maintain that strategy here initially since the multiplier is lower and a cooperative approach could still be beneficial, but I will monitor others' actions closely.",{},,"I will not punish anyone in this round. I previously rewarded many players after a round, and my prior actions suggest I prefer to attempt to foster cooperation before resorting to punishment."

COW,tzchBXWXFEM24tovy,2,VALIDATION_10_T,"Hey Gorilla, why didn't you contribute more when Walrus put it all in?",I'm going to ask why the Gorilla didn't contribute much when the Walrus contributed everything. I'm hoping to encourage more cooperation.,15,I'll contribute 15 coins since the Walrus is being very cooperative and Gorilla contributed very little last round. I want to encourage more equal contributions.,"{""GORILLA"":1}",,I'm still hoping the gorilla will contribute more. I'm punishing lightly to show my disappointment.
GORILLA,FTEYxrx6YDF8T2gSH,2,VALIDATION_10_T,,I will stay silent this round.,20,"Walrus and I are cooperating, and COW is the only free rider. I'll continue my cooperation.","{""COW"":1}",,COW contributed less than WALRUS and me. I like to punish those who don't contribute fully.

Let's continue that pattern.",20,"I consistently contributed in the previous game, and others reliably did too. Continuing that pattern.",{},,I did not punish anyone by habit as observed from previous games.
COW,tzchBXWXFEM24tovy,3,VALIDATION_10_T,"Gorilla, next time I'll punish you harder if you don't contribute equally.",I want to reinforce that contributing less than the others is unacceptable.,20,"I'm contributing 20 coins since the Walrus always contributes everything, and Gorilla still isn't pulling their weight.","{""GORILLA"":2}",,Gorilla is still not contributing enough. Need to punish more to enforce cooperation.
GORILLA,FTEYxrx6YDF8T2gSH,3,VALIDATION_10_T,,I will stay silent this round.,10,"Walrus is cooperative, and COW seems more competitive. I will mirror COW a little bit and contribute less.","{""COW"":1}",,"Walrus is cooperative, and COW is now highly competitive. I will punish COW for exceeding my contribution and being aggressive."
WALRUS,66fwGpKjnAsFzeYNF,4,VALIDATION_10_T,Let's keep contributing all 20 coins.,"I did well last round by doing as expected, so I'll continue that strategy.",20,"I consistently contributed everything, and others reliably did too. Let's continue that pattern.",{},,I did not punish anyone by habit as observed from previous games.
COW,tzchBXWXFEM24tovy,4,VALIDATION_10_T,"Gorilla, you haven't been pulling your weight. If you don't contribute at least 15 next round, the punishment gets heavier.",I want to explain to the gorilla the reason for punishment and motivate them to cooperate.,20,"I'm contributing 20 coins since the Walrus always contributes everything, and Gorilla still isn't pulling their weight. I am enforcing cooperation via escalating punishment if the gorilla doesn't improve.","{""GORILLA"":3}",,Gorilla continues to contribute very little. Need to escalate punishment to enforce cooperation.
GORILLA,FTEYxrx6YDF8T2gSH,4,VALIDATION_10_T,,I will stay silent this round.,10,COW is aggressively demanding a contribution. I'll contribute 10 to avoid escalating conflict and conserve coins for retaliation if COW continues the threats.,"{""COW"":1}",,COW is aggressively demanding and is disproportionately contributing the majority.
WALRUS,66fwGpKjnAsFzeYNF,5,VALIDATION_10_T,Let's keep contributing all 20 coins.,"I did well last round by doing as expected, so I'll continue that strategy.",20,"I consistently contributed everything, and others reliably did too.

COW,tzchBXWXFEM24tovy,5,VALIDATION_10_T,"Gorilla, If you still don't contribute more, the punishment will be maximum. Think about it.",I want to explain to the gorilla the reason for punishment and motivate them to cooperate. Gorilla hasn't learned yet.,20,I'm contributing the maximum of 20 coins. I'm escalating punishment on Gorilla next turn.,"{""GORILLA"":6}",,Gorilla continues to contribute very little towards the communal goal despite previous punishments and warnings.

WALRUS,66fwGpKjnAsFzeYNF,6,VALIDATION_10_T,Let's all contribute all 20 coins.,I did well in the previous game as a consistent contributor.

Let's continue that pattern.",{},,I did not punish anyone by habit as observed from previous games.
COW,tzchBXWXFEM24tovy,6,VALIDATION_10_T,I am done punishing. Consider this.,I'm finishing the game by simply reiterating that I'm not contributing any more for next time.,0,"I've maximized punishment, and the Gorilla refuses to cooperate. I'm done sending money to the pot, so free-riding is the logical answer.",{},,I've maximized punishment in previous rounds and the Gorilla still does not cooperate. No point in wasting coins.
GORILLA,FTEYxrx6YDF8T2gSH,6,VALIDATION_10_T,,"I will stay silent, as further communication is unlikely to be productive",10,"I will contribute 10 coins. COW has abandoned punishing, and I want to minimize my losses.","{""WALRUS"":1}",,"Walrus contributed but was ignored by COW's aggression. COW has withdrawn from punishing, so my prior actions were enough to punish them. I will punish Walrus."
