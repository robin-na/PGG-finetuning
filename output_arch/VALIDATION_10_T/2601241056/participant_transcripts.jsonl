The pot multiplier is 1.9×. </ROUND_INFO>\nReasoning: In the final round, the goal is to maximize the group's overall payoff by encouraging all players to contribute as much as possible. Given that SLOTH has consistently contributed less, a final push with a message encouraging higher contributions might motivate a change. I'll maintain my contribution to demonstrate commitment to the cooperative strategy and hope that SLOTH will increase their contribution as well.\n\nMessage: \"Let's make the last round count with our best contributions!\"\n\nContribution: 15\nAnswer: <CONTRIB> 15 </CONTRIB>\n<REDIST total_contrib=\"40\" multiplied_contrib=\"76.0\" active_players=\"3\" redistributed_each=\"25.3\"/>\n<PEERS_CONTRIBUTIONS> SLOTH=10,OWL=15 </PEERS_CONTRIBUTIONS>\n<!-- PEER_ORDER [\"SLOTH\", \"OWL\"] -->\n<MECHANISM_INFO> It will cost you, per unit, 4 coins to impose a deduction of 12.0 coins.

While this is the last opportunity to address this behavior through punishment, it may not significantly impact the outcome since there are no future rounds to influence. However, applying a mild punishment could serve as a signal of dissatisfaction with their contribution strategy, promoting fairness in similar future interactions. Nonetheless, given that this is the final round, the impact of punishment might be minimal.\n\nPunishment: None\nAnswer: [0, 0]>> </PUNISHMENTS>\n<ROUND SUMMARY json='{\"WALRUS (YOU)\":{\"coins_spent_on_punish\":0,\"coins_deducted_from_you\":0,\"payoff\":30},\"SLOTH\":{\"coins_spent_on_punish\":0,\"coins_deducted_from_them\":0,\"payoff\":35},\"OWL\":{\"coins_spent_on_punish\":0,\"coins_deducted_from_them\":0,\"payoff\":30}}'/>\n</ROUND>"}
