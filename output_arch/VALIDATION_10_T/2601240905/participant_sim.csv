MOOSE,2,VALIDATION_10_T,3,I will maintain a low contribution to observe others' behaviors and ensure I have coins for future rounds.,{},,"The Whale continues to contribute generously, which benefits everyone. The contributions from both players are acceptable, so no punishment is necessary."
WHALE,2,VALIDATION_10_T,10,Contributing a moderate amount again should encourage peers to increase their contributions while maintaining a balance between personal gain and group benefit.,"{""CHICKEN"":2,""MOOSE"":2}",,"Despite previous punishment, peers have not increased their contributions, suggesting stronger action might be necessary to incentivize higher contributions for the group's benefit."
CHICKEN,3,VALIDATION_10_T,5,WHALE has been contributing a significant amount while I have been contributing moderately. Increasing my contribution slightly might foster more trust and cooperation in the group.,{},,"WHALE has consistently contributed a high amount, showing cooperation, while MOOSE has been contributing less.

WHALE,4,VALIDATION_10_T,10,"Continuing to contribute a moderate amount shows consistency and leadership, potentially encouraging higher contributions from peers for mutual benefit.","{""MOOSE"":2}",,"Chicken has shown improvement by increasing their contribution, which should be acknowledged positively. Moose, however, remains consistent in their low contributions, impacting the group's potential benefit negatively. Continued punishment of Moose is necessary to encourage change."
CHICKEN,5,VALIDATION_10_T,7,Continuing to increase my contribution can further encourage group cooperation and increase the group's total payoff. WHALE's consistent high contributions show a cooperative strategy worth supporting.,{},,"WHALE continues to contribute significantly, demonstrating a cooperative approach.
