CHICK,1,VALIDATION_10_T,Let's try to cooperate!,"I will start by contributing a small amount, hoping others will do the same. If they don't, I will decrease my contribution in later rounds. I will contribute 5 coins.",5,I am contributing 5 coins. I want to test the waters and see how others respond. I will observe the results and adjust next time.,{},,I will not punish anyone this round. My payoff was 20 - 5 + 7.6 = 22.6. It's not bad and punishing will just increase costs for everyone.

MONKEY,4,VALIDATION_10_T,,,nan,,"{""CHICK"":2,""PINGUIN"":2}",,Everyone has stopped contributing. I'll punish both other players by 2 units each to increase the cost of defection. This is costly but might encourage cooperation.
CHICK,4,VALIDATION_10_T,I'll go to 0 as well.,"After looking at the previous round’s results, I see that everyone chose to contribute 0. This could easily happen due to a misunderstanding or a free-riding strategy. I will decrease my contribution to 0 as well because I don't want to be the only one contributing.",nan,,{},,I will not punish anyone as everyone contributed 0. It's the rational response to others' actions.

CHICK,6,VALIDATION_10_T,"It's the end of the game, so going with 0.","Since everyone seems to have fallen into a pattern of contributing 0 and punishing each other, I will contribute 0 as well. There isn't any benefit in contributing at this point.",0,I will contribute 0 as there is no point in cooperating anymore. The last few rounds have been about punishing each other.,"{""MONKEY"":1,""PINGUIN"":1}",,I will punish Monkey again with one unit. Last time I punished him there were no changes.
