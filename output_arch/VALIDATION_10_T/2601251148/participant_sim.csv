GORILLA,1,VALIDATION_10_T,,"Okay, let's start this game. I need to decide whether to send a message to the group or stay silent. Since it's the first round, maybe I should introduce myself and express interest in collaborating. That way, others know who I am and what my intentions are. Let me check the rules again to make sure I'm following them correctly. The format requires me to put my reasoning in <Reasoning> tags and optionally a message in <CHAT> tags. I should keep the message friendly and open-ended to encourage interaction. Alright, I'll go with sending a message.",20,,{},,

I should not punish because my contribution is small and others may not be in a good position.  I may contribute more in the next round.  Since the punishment would cost me 4 coins per unit, which is high. I think the best idea is to not punish and wait for the others to change their behavior."

CROCODILE,4,VALIDATION_10_T,,,13,"I contribute more in this round (13) compared to previous rounds. I feel that the previous contribution by others was not great, so I want to compensate for that by contributing more. I think the group needs to be in a balanced situation. I feel the GORILLA's contribution has been low and I should try to help the group. So, I contribute 13 to the shared pot this round.",{},,"I do not feel like punishing others because the punishment cost is high, and I have a limited budget of 20 coins.  I can't afford to spend too much on punishment. So, I think it's better to not punish others and just contribute more for the group benefit."

However, punishing would cost me coins, so I need to decide whether the benefit of a higher pot outweighs the cost.  If I punish one unit, it costs me 4 coins and reduces their payoff by 12 coins.  I need to see if this is worth it.  But since the pot is multiplied by 1.9, maybe I should focus on contributing more instead.  So I'll not punish anyone this time."
