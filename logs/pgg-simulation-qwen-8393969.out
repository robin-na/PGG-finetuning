You are playing an online public goods game (PGG). Each round, you are given 20 coins and need to decide how many coins to put into the shared pot (integer from 0 to 20).
You will not see others' choices before you decide.
The pot is multiplied by 1.9× and split equally among all players.
Your round payoff is: coins you kept + your equal share of the multiplied pot.
After contributions are redistributed, players may punish each other.
Follow the stage instructions exactly.
The required response format will be shown at the END of each prompt.
When asked for reasoning, use <Reasoning>...</Reasoning> and keep it brief.
At the start of each round, you may optionally send ONE short message to the group.
It is valid to stay silent; only speak when it helps.

You are playing an online public goods game (PGG). Each round, you are given 20 coins and need to decide how many coins to put into the shared pot (integer from 0 to 20).
You will not see others' choices before you decide.
The pot is multiplied by 1.9× and split equally among all players.
Your round payoff is: coins you kept + your equal share of the multiplied pot.
After contributions are redistributed, players may punish each other.
Follow the stage instructions exactly.
The required response format will be shown at the END of each prompt.
When asked for reasoning, use <Reasoning>...</Reasoning> and keep it brief.
At the start of each round, you may optionally send ONE short message to the group.
It is valid to stay silent; only speak when it helps.

You are playing an online public goods game (PGG). Each round, you are given 20 coins and need to decide how many coins to put into the shared pot (integer from 0 to 20).
You will not see others' choices before you decide.
The pot is multiplied by 1.9× and split equally among all players.
Your round payoff is: coins you kept + your equal share of the multiplied pot.
After contributions are redistributed, players may punish each other.

----- PROMPT (CONTRIB) -----
You are playing an online public goods game (PGG). Each round, you are given 20 coins and need to decide how many coins to put into the shared pot (integer from 0 to 20).
You will not see others' choices before you decide.
The pot is multiplied by 1.9× and split equally among all players.
Your round payoff is: coins you kept + your equal share of the multiplied pot.
After contributions are redistributed, players may punish each other.
Follow the stage instructions exactly.
The required response format will be shown at the END of each prompt.
When asked for reasoning, use <Reasoning>...</Reasoning> and keep it brief.
At the start of each round, you may optionally send ONE short message to the group.
It is valid to stay silent; only speak when it helps.

----- PROMPT (ACTIONS) -----
You are playing an online public goods game (PGG). Each round, you are given 20 coins and need to decide how many coins to put into the shared pot (integer from 0 to 20).
You will not see others' choices before you decide.
The pot is multiplied by 1.9× and split equally among all players.
Your round payoff is: coins you kept + your equal share of the multiplied pot.
After contributions are redistributed, players may punish each other.
Follow the stage instructions exactly.
The required response format will be shown at the END of each prompt.
When asked for reasoning, use <Reasoning>...</Reasoning> and keep it brief.
At the start of each round, you may optionally send ONE short message to the group.
It is valid to stay silent; only speak when it helps.

You are playing an online public goods game (PGG). Each round, you are given 20 coins and need to decide how many coins to put into the shared pot (integer from 0 to 20).
You will not see others' choices before you decide.
The pot is multiplied by 1.9× and split equally among all players.
Your round payoff is: coins you kept + your equal share of the multiplied pot.
After contributions are redistributed, players may punish each other.
Follow the stage instructions exactly.
The required response format will be shown at the END of each prompt.
When asked for reasoning, use <Reasoning>...</Reasoning> and keep it brief.
At the start of each round, you may optionally send ONE short message to the group.

You are playing an online public goods game (PGG). Each round, you are given 20 coins and need to decide how many coins to put into the shared pot (integer from 0 to 20).
You will not see others' choices before you decide.
The pot is multiplied by 1.9× and split equally among all players.
Your round payoff is: coins you kept + your equal share of the multiplied pot.
After contributions are redistributed, players may punish each other.
Follow the stage instructions exactly.

You are playing an online public goods game (PGG). Each round, you are given 20 coins and need to decide how many coins to put into the shared pot (integer from 0 to 20).
You will not see others' choices before you decide.
The pot is multiplied by 1.9× and split equally among all players.
Your round payoff is: coins you kept + your equal share of the multiplied pot.
After contributions are redistributed, players may punish each other.
Follow the stage instructions exactly.
The required response format will be shown at the END of each prompt.
When asked for reasoning, use <Reasoning>...</Reasoning> and keep it brief.
At the start of each round, you may optionally send ONE short message to the group.
It is valid to stay silent; only speak when it helps.
