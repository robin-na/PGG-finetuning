First, I need to decide whether to send a message in the chat stage. Since the game is a public goods game, communication can influence others' strategies. However, in the first round, there's no prior information about others' behavior. A message might encourage cooperation, but without knowing the group dynamics, it's risky to assume. 

If I send a message, it should be neutral and non-committal. Maybe something like, "Let's all contribute to maximize collective gains." This promotes cooperation without binding commitments. Alternatively, staying silent might be safer since there's no prior history to'

<Reasoning> Since this is the first round, I should consider the potential for cooperation. Contributing some coins to the shared pot could lead to higher overall gains, as the pot is multiplied by 1.9 and split equally. However, I need to balance this with the risk of others not contributing, which might result in a lower return. I'll start by contributing a moderate amount, say 10 coins, to encourage cooperation while keeping some for myself. </Reasoning>

<Reasoning> Based on the previous rounds, I notice that my contributions are being matched by others. In round 1, I contributed 20 coins, and others contributed 5 and 20. In round 2, both others contributed 20. This suggests that others might be following a cooperative strategy. To maintain the positive outcome, I should continue contributing 20 coins to the pot. This will ensure that the total contribution is maximized, leading to a higher multiplied pot and equal shares. I should not punish anyone as there's no evidence of free-riding. </Reasoning>

This inconsistency might lower the overall pot. To encourage more contributions, I should consider contributing less in the next round.

<Reasoning> Since this is the first round, I should consider the potential for cooperation. Contributing some coins to the shared pot could lead to higher overall gains, as the pot is multiplied by 1.9 and split equally. However, I need to balance this with the risk of others not contributing, which might result in a lower return.

<Reasoning> Since this is the first round, I should consider the potential for cooperation. Contributing some coins to the shared pot could lead to higher overall gains, as the pot is multiplied by 1.9 and split equally. However, I need to balance this with the risk of others not contributing, which might result in a lower return. I'll start by contributing a moderate amount, say 10 coins, to encourage cooperation while keeping some for myself. </Reasoning>

<Reasoning> Based on the previous rounds, I notice that my contributions are being matched by others. In round 1, I contributed 20 coins, and others contributed 5 and 20. In round 2, both others contributed 20. This suggests that others might be following a cooperative strategy. To maintain the positive outcome, I should continue contributing 20 coins to the pot. This will ensure that the total contribution is maximized, leading to a higher multiplied pot and equal shares. I should not punish anyone as there's no evidence of free-riding. </Reasoning>

Okay, let's see. In this round, I contributed 20 coins again, which is my usual strategy. The total contributions were 27, so the multiplied pot is 51.3, split among three players. My payoff was 17.1. But looking at the peers' contributions, Chicken contributed 4 and Crocodile contributed 3. Both are low, which didn't maximize the pot. Maybe I should consider punishing them for free-riding. However, punishing costs coins. The cost per unit is 4 coins per unit, and'

<Reasoning> Since this is the first round, I should consider the potential for cooperation. Contributing some coins to the shared pot could lead to higher overall gains, as the pot is multiplied by 1.9 and split equally. However, I need to balance this with the risk of others not contributing, which might result in a lower return. I'll start by contributing a moderate amount, say 10 coins, to encourage cooperation while keeping some for myself. </Reasoning>

<Reasoning> Based on the previous rounds, I notice that my contributions are being matched by others. In round 1, I contributed 20 coins, and others contributed 5 and 20. In round 2, both others contributed 20. This suggests that others might be following a cooperative strategy. To maintain the positive outcome, I should continue contributing 20 coins to the pot. This will ensure that the total contribution is maximized, leading to a higher multiplied pot and equal shares. I should not punish anyone as there's no evidence of free-riding. </Reasoning>

Okay, let's see. I'm in the fifth round of this public goods game. So far, I've been contributing 20 coins every time, but the other players' contributions have varied. In the third round, they contributed 5 and 0, which led to a lower total pot. Maybe I should consider adjusting my contribution if others aren't contributing enough. But wait, the multiplier is still 1.9, so even if others contribute less, contributing my maximum might still be optimal. However, looking at the fourth round, they contributed 4 and'

<Reasoning> Based on the previous rounds, I notice that my contributions are being matched by others. In round 1, I contributed 20 coins, and others contributed 5 and 20. In round 2, both others contributed 20. This suggests that others might be following a cooperative strategy. To maintain the positive outcome, I should continue contributing 20 coins to the pot. This will ensure that the total contribution is maximized, leading to a higher multiplied pot and equal shares. I should not punish anyone as there's no evidence of free-riding. </Reasoning>

<Reasoning> Since this is the first round, I should consider the potential for cooperation. Contributing some coins to the shared pot could lead to higher overall gains, as the pot is multiplied by 1.9 and split equally. However, I need to balance this with the risk of others not contributing, which might result in a lower return. I'll start by contributing a moderate amount, say 10 coins, to encourage cooperation while keeping some for myself. </Reasoning>

In round 2, both others contributed 20. This suggests that others might be following a cooperative strategy. To maintain the positive outcome, I should continue contributing 20 coins to the pot.

<Reasoning> It seems that Chicken has contributed 15 coins, while Monkey contributed 20. My contribution is only 3, which may not align with the group's efforts. To encourage fair contribution, I might consider punishing Chicken for under-contributing. However, punishing could lead to retaliation, so I need to assess the cost and potential benefits. Since the cost to punish is 4 coins per unit, and each unit deducts 12 from the target, I should check if the benefit of punishment outweighs the cost. Since the pot multiplier is 1.9,'

<Reasoning> Since this is the first round, I should consider the potential for cooperation. Contributing some coins to the shared pot could lead to higher overall gains, as the pot is multiplied by 1.9 and split equally. However, I need to balance this with the risk of others not contributing, which might result in a lower return. I'll start by contributing a moderate amount, say 10 coins, to encourage cooperation while keeping some for myself. </Reasoning>

<Reasoning> Based on the previous rounds, I notice that my contributions are being matched by others. In round 1, I contributed 20 coins, and others contributed 5 and 20. In round 2, both others contributed 20. This suggests that others might be following a cooperative strategy. To maintain the positive outcome, I should continue contributing 20 coins to the pot. This will ensure that the total contribution is maximized, leading to a higher multiplied pot and equal shares. I should not punish anyone as there's no evidence of free-riding. </Reasoning>

<Reasoning> Since this is the first round, I should consider the potential for cooperation. Contributing some coins to the shared pot could lead to higher overall gains, as the pot is multiplied by 1.9 and split equally. However, I need to balance this with the risk of others not contributing, which might result in a lower return. I'll start by contributing a moderate amount, say 10 coins, to encourage cooperation while keeping some for myself. </Reasoning>

<Reasoning> Based on the previous rounds, I notice that my contributions are being matched by others. In round 1, I contributed 20 coins, and others contributed 5 and 20. In round 2, both others contributed 20. This suggests that others might be following a cooperative strategy. To maintain the positive outcome, I should continue contributing 20 coins to the pot. This will ensure that the total contribution is maximized, leading to a higher multiplied pot and equal shares. I should not punish anyone as there's no evidence of free-riding. </Reasoning>

Okay, let's see. I'm in the sixth round of this public goods game. Each round, I have 20 coins and decide how much to contribute to the pot. The pot gets multiplied by 1.9 and split evenly. So far, in previous rounds, I've always contributed 20 coins, which seems to be the optimal choice since the multiplier is greater than 1. That way, the total pot is maximized, benefiting everyone. 

Looking at the contributions from others in the last round: Chicken contributed 15, Crocodile contributed'

You are playing an online public goods game (PGG). Each round, you are given 20 coins and need to decide how many coins to put into the shared pot (integer from 0 to 20).
You will not see others' choices before you decide.
The pot is multiplied by 1.9× and split equally among all players.
Your round payoff is: coins you kept + your equal share of the multiplied pot.
After contributions are redistributed, players may punish each other.
Follow the stage instructions exactly.

<Reasoning> Since this is the first round, I should consider the potential for cooperation. Contributing some coins to the shared pot could lead to higher overall gains, as the pot is multiplied by 1.9 and split equally. However, I need to balance this with the risk of others not contributing, which might result in a lower return. I'll start by contributing a moderate amount, say 10 coins, to encourage cooperation while keeping some for myself. </Reasoning>

<Reasoning> Based on the previous rounds, I notice that my contributions are being matched by others. In round 1, I contributed 20 coins, and others contributed 5 and 20. In round 2, both others contributed 20. This suggests that others might be following a cooperative strategy. To maintain the positive outcome, I should continue contributing 20 coins to the pot. This will ensure that the total contribution is maximized, leading to a higher multiplied pot and equal shares. I should not punish anyone as there's no evidence of free-riding. </Reasoning>

----- PROMPT (ACTIONS) -----
You are playing an online public goods game (PGG). Each round, you are given 20 coins and need to decide how many coins to put into the shared pot (integer from 0 to 20).
You will not see others' choices before you decide.
The pot is multiplied by 1.9× and split equally among all players.
Your round payoff is: coins you kept + your equal share of the multiplied pot.
After contributions are redistributed, players may punish each other.
Follow the stage instructions exactly.
The required response format will be shown at the END of each prompt.
When asked for reasoning, use <Reasoning>...</Reasoning> and keep it brief.
At the start of each round, you may optionally send ONE short message to the group.
It is valid to stay silent; only speak when it helps.

<Reasoning> It seems that my contributions are not matching the others' expectations. In the previous round, I contributed 3 coins while Chicken contributed 15 and Monkey contributed 20. The total contribution was 38, which led to a higher payoff for everyone. However, in the current round, others contributed 8 and 20 respectively, and I contributed 1. This might lead to a lower total contribution, affecting the overall pot. To encourage more contributions, I should consider increasing my contribution to match the average or set a new cooperative level. Since there is no'

In the final round, I should consider the overall performance and the need for cooperation. Even though some players may not contribute much, the multiplier is still beneficial. I will continue to contribute maximally and avoid punishment. The best strategy is to contribute 20 coins and not engage in punishment. This ensures the highest possible return for all players.
