Okay, let me think about this. So, I'm playing this public goods game where each round I have 20 coins. I need to decide how many to contribute to the shared pot. The pot gets multiplied by 1.9 and then split equally. The key here is figuring out the optimal contribution that balances my own gain and the group's benefit.

First, let me calculate the returns. If I contribute 'x' coins, the total pot becomes 1.9*(sum of all contributions). Each player gets their share of that pot. Let's say there'

Okay, let's see. I need to decide how many coins to contribute to the shared pot. The rules say I have 20 coins, and I can contribute any integer from 0 to 20. The pot gets multiplied by 1.9 and then split equally. 

In the first round, I should probably start with a moderate contribution to encourage cooperation. If everyone contributes a bit, the total pot will be higher, which when multiplied by 1.9, gives more for everyone. But if everyone is selfish and contributes 0, the pot is zero, so nothing is gained.

Okay, so I need to figure out how much to contribute in this first round. The game is a public goods game where everyone starts with 20 coins. I can contribute any integer from 0 to 20. The pot gets multiplied by 1.9 and then split equally. 

First, I should think about the optimal contribution. If everyone contributes, the total pot would be 20 times the number of players multiplied by 1.9, then divided by the number of players. But since I don't know how'

Alright, let's break this down. In the first round, I need to decide how many coins to contribute. The pot is multiplied by 1.9 and then split equally. Let's say everyone contributes 5 coins, which is what SNAKE did. The total pot would be 20 players * 5 coins = 100 coins. Multiply by 1.9 gives 190. Divided by 20 players, each gets 9.5 coins.

Okay, so I'm in the second round of this public goods game. Let me think about what's happening here. 

First, the setup: each player starts with 20 coins. In each round, you decide how much to contribute to the shared pot. The total contributions are multiplied by 1.9, then split equally among all players. Then there's a punishment phase where you can deduct coins from others by spending coins yourself. 

Looking at the previous round's summary for Round 1: I contributed 1 coin. The total contributions from SNAKE and MOOSE were 20 each, so total'

You are playing an online public goods game (PGG). Each round, you are given 20 coins and need to decide how many coins to put into the shared pot (integer from 0 to 20).
You will not see others' choices before you decide.
The pot is multiplied by 1.9× and split equally among all players.
Your round payoff is: coins you kept + your equal share of the multiplied pot.
After contributions are redistributed, players may punish each other.

Let's analyze the situation. In the first two rounds, I contributed 20 coins each time, but PARROT contributed only 1 coin, while SNAKE contributed 20. The total contributions were 41, which when multiplied by 1.9 gives 77.9, split equally among 3 players, giving each 25.97. My payoff was 20 (remaining coins) + '

Okay, so I'm on round 3 of this public goods game. Let me try to figure out what to do. 

First, looking at the previous rounds. In rounds 1 and 2, I contributed 1 coin each time. The other players, SNAKE and MOOSE, contributed 20 each time. The pot was multiplied by 1.9, so with a total contribution of 41 (20+20+1), the multiplied pot is 41 * 1.9 = 77.9. Then this is split equally among 3 players, so each'

You are playing an online public goods game (PGG). Each round, you are given 20 coins and need to decide how many coins to put into the shared pot (integer from 0 to 20).
You will not see others' choices before you decide.
The pot is multiplied by 1.9× and split equally among all players.
Your round payoff is: coins you kept + your equal share of the multiplied pot.
After contributions are redistributed, players may punish each other.
Follow the stage instructions exactly.
The required response format will be shown at the END of each prompt.

Okay, so I'm in the fourth round of this public goods game. Let me try to figure out what to do. 

First, looking at the history. In the first three rounds, I contributed 1, 1, and then 3 coins. The other players, SNAKE and MOOSE, have been contributing 20 each time. Wait, but in the third round, the summary showed that MOOSE had some punishment, and their payoff dropped. But in the third round, my contribution was 3, which is higher than the previous rounds. 

Wait, the pot multiplier is 1.9'

----- PROMPT (ACTIONS) -----
You are playing an online public goods game (PGG). Each round, you are given 20 coins and need to decide how many coins to put into the shared pot (integer from 0 to 20).
You will not see others' choices before you decide.
The pot is multiplied by 1.9× and split equally among all players.
Your round payoff is: coins you kept + your equal share of the multiplied pot.
After contributions are redistributed, players may punish each other.
Follow the stage instructions exactly.
The required response format will be shown at the END of each prompt.
When asked for reasoning, use <Reasoning>...</Reasoning> and keep it brief.
At the start of each round, you may optionally send ONE short message to the group.
It is valid to stay silent; only speak when it helps.

You are playing an online public goods game (PGG). Each round, you are given 20 coins and need to decide how many coins to put into the shared pot (integer from 0 to 20).
You will not see others' choices before you decide.
The pot is multiplied by 1.9× and split equally among all players.
Your round payoff is: coins you kept + your equal share of the multiplied pot.
After contributions are redistributed, players may punish each other.
Follow the stage instructions exactly.
The required response format will be shown at the END of each prompt.
When asked for reasoning, use <Reasoning>...</Reasoning> and keep it brief.
At the start of each round, you may optionally send ONE short message to the group.
It is valid to stay silent; only speak when it helps.

<Reasoning> 1. In round 1 and 2, the total contribution was consistently 41, but the multiplier gave a good return. 2. I contributed 20 each time, which was more than the average, but Parrot's contribution was very low (1). 3. Parrot might be acting selfishly, so I should consider punishing them, but the cost might be high. 4.

Now, I need to determine my contribution and punishment for the final round. Let's analyze the situation. In the previous round, I punished both SNAKE and PARROT, but it seems that their contributions didn't increase. In fact, they both contributed only 1 coin each. This might indicate that they are not responding to the punishment. However, I should consider the overall group dynamics. Since the pot multiplier is still 1.9×, contributing more could still be beneficial for everyone. But since my previous punishments didn't result in higher'

Okay, let's see what's going on here. I'm in the sixth round of this public goods game. Let me recap the previous rounds to figure out what's optimal now.

In the first three rounds, I contributed 1, 1, and then 3 coins. But in round 3, MOOSE was punished by 8 coins, and in round 4, SNAKE contributed 20, but then in round 5, SNAKE contributed only 1, and MOOSE contributed 20.

You are playing an online public goods game (PGG). Each round, you are given 20 coins and need to decide how many coins to put into the shared pot (integer from 0 to 20).
You will not see others' choices before you decide.
The pot is multiplied by 1.9× and split equally among all players.
Your round payoff is: coins you kept + your equal share of the multiplied pot.
After contributions are redistributed, players may punish each other.
Follow the stage instructions exactly.
The required response format will be shown at the END of each prompt.
When asked for reasoning, use <Reasoning>...</Reasoning> and keep it brief.
At the start of each round, you may optionally send ONE short message to the group.

All players are contributing minimally, so the pot is not beneficial. 4. I should consider punishing others for their low contributions, but it may not be effective. 5. Alternatively, I could also contribute minimally and avoid punishment. 6. I will choose to not punish anyone and contribute minim'

After the sixth round, what would be the final payoff for each player (Moose, Snake, and Parrot)?
To determine the final payoffs, let's analyze each round's contributions and punishments:

1. **Round 1**: 
   - Contributions: Moose=20, Snake=20, Parrot=1
   - Total pot = 41, multiplied by 1.9 = 77.9
   - Each gets 77.9 / 3 ≈ 25.97
   - Payoffs: Moose (20 kept + 25.9'

Let's calculate the total payoff for each player in Round 6.

First, determine the total contributions and the shared pot. Players contributed 1, 1, and 1 coin. The total pot is 3 coins. The multiplier is 1.9. So the multiplied pot is 3 * 1.9 = 5.7 coins. The pot is split equally among 3 players, so each gets 5.7 / 3 = 1.9 coins.
