/home/robinna/.conda/envs/llm_conda/lib/python3.9/contextlib.py:87: FutureWarning: `torch.backends.cuda.sdp_kernel()` is deprecated. In the future, this context manager will be removed. Please see `torch.nn.attention.sdpa_kernel()` for the new context manager, with updated signature.
  self.gen = func(*args, **kwds)
`torch_dtype` is deprecated! Use `dtype` instead!
