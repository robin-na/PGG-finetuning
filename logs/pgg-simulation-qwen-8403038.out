You are playing an online public goods game (PGG). Each round, you are given 20 coins and need to decide how many coins to put into the shared pot (integer from 0 to 20).
You will not see others' choices before you decide.
The pot is multiplied by 1.9× and split equally among all players.
Your round payoff is: coins you kept + your equal share of the multiplied pot.
After contributions are redistributed, players may punish each other.
Always respond with ONLY valid single-line JSON per the required format at the END of each prompt.
At the start of each round, you may optionally send ONE short message to the group.

You are playing an online public goods game (PGG). Each round, you are given 20 coins and need to decide how many coins to put into the shared pot (integer from 0 to 20).
You will not see others' choices before you decide.
The pot is multiplied by 1.9× and split equally among all players.
Your round payoff is: coins you kept + your equal share of the multiplied pot.
After contributions are redistributed, players may punish each other.
Always respond with ONLY valid single-line JSON per the required format at the END of each prompt.
At the start of each round, you may optionally send ONE short message to the group.

You are playing an online public goods game (PGG). Each round, you are given 20 coins and need to decide how many coins to put into the shared pot (integer from 0 to 20).
You will not see others' choices before you decide.
The pot is multiplied by 1.9× and split equally among all players.
Your round payoff is: coins you kept + your equal share of the multiplied pot.
After contributions are redistributed, players may punish each other.

You are playing an online public goods game (PGG). Each round, you are given 20 coins and need to decide how many coins to put into the shared pot (integer from 0 to 20).
You will not see others' choices before you decide.
The pot is multiplied by 1.9× and split equally among all players.
Your round payoff is: coins you kept + your equal share of the multiplied pot.
After contributions are redistributed, players may punish each other.
Always respond with ONLY valid single-line JSON per the required format at the END of each prompt.
At the start of each round, you may optionally send ONE short message to the group.

You are playing an online public goods game (PGG). Each round, you are given 20 coins and need to decide how many coins to put into the shared pot (integer from 0 to 20).
You will not see others' choices before you decide.
The pot is multiplied by 1.9× and split equally among all players.
Your round payoff is: coins you kept + your equal share of the multiplied pot.
After contributions are redistributed, players may punish each other.
Always respond with ONLY valid single-line JSON per the required format at the END of each prompt.
At the start of each round, you may optionally send ONE short message to the group.

----- PROMPT (ACTIONS) -----
You are playing an online public goods game (PGG). Each round, you are given 20 coins and need to decide how many coins to put into the shared pot (integer from 0 to 20).
You will not see others' choices before you decide.
The pot is multiplied by 1.9× and split equally among all players.
Your round payoff is: coins you kept + your equal share of the multiplied pot.
After contributions are redistributed, players may punish each other.
Always respond with ONLY valid single-line JSON per the required format at the END of each prompt.
At the start of each round, you may optionally send ONE short message to the group.

----- PROMPT (CHAT) -----
You are playing an online public goods game (PGG). Each round, you are given 20 coins and need to decide how many coins to put into the shared pot (integer from 0 to 20).
You will not see others' choices before you decide.
The pot is multiplied by 1.9× and split equally among all players.
Your round payoff is: coins you kept + your equal share of the multiplied pot.
After contributions are redistributed, players may punish each other.
Always respond with ONLY valid single-line JSON per the required format at the END of each prompt.
At the start of each round, you may optionally send ONE short message to the group.

----- PROMPT (CONTRIB) -----
You are playing an online public goods game (PGG). Each round, you are given 20 coins and need to decide how many coins to put into the shared pot (integer from 0 to 20).
You will not see others' choices before you decide.
The pot is multiplied by 1.9× and split equally among all players.
Your round payoff is: coins you kept + your equal share of the multiplied pot.
After contributions are redistributed, players may punish each other.
Always respond with ONLY valid single-line JSON per the required format at the END of each prompt.
At the start of each round, you may optionally send ONE short message to the group.

You are playing an online public goods game (PGG). Each round, you are given 20 coins and need to decide how many coins to put into the shared pot (integer from 0 to 20).
You will not see others' choices before you decide.
The pot is multiplied by 1.9× and split equally among all players.
Your round payoff is: coins you kept + your equal share of the multiplied pot.
After contributions are redistributed, players may punish each other.
Always respond with ONLY valid single-line JSON per the required format at the END of each prompt.
At the start of each round, you may optionally send ONE short message to the group.
