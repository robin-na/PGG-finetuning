They always give the entire endowment to the public fund and never deviate, even as others fluctuate and as their own relative payoff is persistently lower than that of several group members. There is no evidence of conditional cooperation; their behavior does not adjust upward or downward in response to higher or lower average contributions, nor to changes in who is contributing more or less. They appear to hold a strong internal norm that “the right thing” is to fully contribute regardless of what others do, and they tolerate being exploited by lower contributors without reacting in their own contribution choice. Risk tolerance is high in the sense that they persist with full cooperation despite clear information that others free-ride and that this leaves them earning less than others. Fairness norms seem to be internally driven rather than reciprocal: they behave fairly (by contributing fully) but do not condition on whether the environment is fair to them.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey never use punishment at all, despite repeated and salient opportunities and despite the presence of clear low contributors and a powerful, high-leverage punishment technology. They also see other players frequently using punishment (in particular against a chronically low-contributing target), yet they neither join in nor imitate this behavior. This suggests a very high threshold for punishing; either they avoid harming others on principle, or they reject the cost of sanctioning as an acceptable tool, even when it would be efficient or group-beneficial. There is no sign of retaliatory punishment, as they are never punished themselves and never punish in return. There is also no sign of using punishment strategically for deterrence or norm enforcement; they do not appear to try to shape others’ contributions through negative incentives. Overall, they present as a non-punisher with strong reluctance to impose costs on others, even on clear free riders.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nUnknown. They are never the target of punishment, so there is no evidence of how they respond when punished or how they treat identifiable punishers afterward. Their tendencies toward unconditional cooperation and non-punishment suggest, with low confidence, that they would be unlikely to retaliate and might either ignore punishment or possibly interpret it as information rather than a provocation, but this is speculative.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey never use rewards, despite the mechanism being clearly explained and despite visible examples of others using positive rewards. They do not reward either high contributors who match their own behavior or players who reward them. This indicates that they do not engage in explicit positive reinforcement, alliance signaling, or gratitude expression through the reward tool. Given that they already cooperate maximally without conditioning on others, they may see rewarding as unnecessary, too costly, or outside their preferred way of interacting. Their cooperativeness is “silent”: they help the group through contributions but do not invest extra resources to shape or encourage others’ behavior via rewards.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThey receive rewards several times from specific co-players, but they never reciprocate with rewards of their own and they do not alter their contribution behavior, which is already at the maximum. There is no observable attempt to form a mutual-reward alliance or to differentially favor those who reward them versus those who do not. Their gratitude, if present, is not expressed through the available mechanisms. This suggests a style where they maintain their own cooperative standard independently of social approval or side payments, and do not translate being rewarded into explicit reciprocity via the reward tool. Whether they feel gratitude internally is unknown; behaviorally, they remain unchanged and non-reciprocal with respect to rewards.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey repeatedly observe that some players contribute less while earning higher payoffs and sometimes also face heavy punishment from others. Despite this clear evidence of free-riding, payoff inequality, and active sanctioning norms in the group, they neither adjust their own contributions nor participate in enforcement. They tolerate being a consistent net contributor who often earns less than others without any visible attempt to protect themselves or to pressure laggards. They similarly observe positive rewards flowing among others (and to themselves at times) without changing their behavior. Overall, they appear largely indifferent, in terms of strategic adjustment, to others’ payoffs, to how much others spend on punishment or reward, and to who is targeted. Their primary reference point seems to be their own internal rule to fully cooperate, not the evolving distribution of costs and benefits in the group.", "umap_x": 0.8928192853927612, "umap_y": -0.7651201486587524, "cluster_id": 6, "cluster_size": 31, "cluster_title": "Punishment / Reward / Contribution", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around punishment, reward, contribution, contributions, low."}
{"experiment": "2CpmMrTnRYQhD69qN", "participant": "F5KawmecqZFsCNyFk", "game_finished": true, "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a “stubborn moderate cooperator.” They almost always contribute the same intermediate amount, with only one brief deviation downward and one brief deviation upward. Their default is to give a consistent, non-maximal share that is below what many others give but still far from free-riding. They do not systematically adjust contributions in response to changes in others’ average behavior, even when they are repeatedly the unique low contributor among mostly high contributors, and even when they are singled out by punishment. This suggests they treat their chosen level as a personal fairness norm or comfortable compromise between self-interest and group benefit, rather than using a flexible, conditional cooperation strategy. They show low reactive volatility: feedback from others (via punishment, rewards to others, or shifts in group contributions) does not produce sustained upward or downward trends in their own giving. Their risk tolerance appears moderate: they are willing to undercontribute relative to others despite visibility and sanction risk, but they also avoid extreme free-riding that might trigger harsher responses or collapse group cooperation.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey never use punishment, despite having multiple opportunities and a clear pattern that one specific partner targets them with costly sanctions. This indicates a very high threshold for imposing costs on others and a strong reluctance to spend personal resources for either deterrence or retaliation. Their behavior does not show targeted or proportional sanctions toward lower contributors, nor retaliation against someone who persistently punishes them. From this, it is reasonable to infer that they either (a) view punishment as inefficient or not worth the cost, (b) are conflict-averse and prefer not to escalate, or (c) are focused on maximizing own payoff without engaging in norm enforcement. Because they themselves are consistently under the group’s contribution norm, it is also plausible that they recognize their own vulnerability and avoid a punishment “war”; however, this is uncertain. Overall, they function as a non-enforcer type: they free-ride somewhat on the norm-enforcement efforts of others without joining those efforts.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nWhen another player repeatedly punishes them, they do not retaliate, they do not significantly increase their contribution to align with the punisher’s implicit demand, and they do not shift into a punitive stance toward anyone else. Their contribution pattern remains essentially stable after being sanctioned multiple times, including instances where the sanction is substantial. This indicates that punishment does not successfully coerce them into higher cooperation and does not trigger counter-punishment. They appear to “absorb” the punishment and continue with their own strategy, implying either a strong commitment to their chosen contribution level, indifference to others’ attempts to control their behavior, or uncertainty about how to interpret the sanction. They exhibit behavioral forgiveness or at least non-retaliation: even persistent, costly punishment aimed at them does not change their treatment of the punisher relative to other group members.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey never use rewards, even though several others actively reward high contributors. They do not reciprocate those prosocial signals, and they do not selectively reinforce any partner’s behavior. This suggests that they either place low value on norm-reinforcement via positive incentives, consider the reward mechanism inefficient for their own payoff, or are generally uninterested in actively shaping others’ behavior. The absence of rewarding despite clear evidence that others employ it implies they do not try to join the “prosocial coalition” that uses rewards to sustain high cooperation. Their stance is thus passive with respect to positive incentives: they benefit from a high-contribution environment that others help sustain, but they do not invest in maintaining it.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThey never receive rewards from others in this game, so their direct response to being rewarded is unknown. Because they consistently refrain from using reward on anyone, including players who are frequently rewarding others, it is uncertain whether they would respond with reciprocal reward or higher contributions if they ever were rewarded. There is no behavioral evidence that they attempt to form alliances with rewarders or distinguish rewarders from non-rewarders in their own actions.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey observe a group where several players often contribute close to the maximum and sometimes spend on rewards, while one player regularly devotes substantial resources to punishing them. Despite this, they do not visibly condition their behavior on others’ payoffs, spending, or treatment of them. High contributors’ relatively strong earnings and prosocial signaling do not induce them to match those contribution levels, and the punisher’s lower payoffs (due to punishment costs) do not induce them to exploit that player further or adjust contributions downward. They appear largely indifferent, behaviorally, to whether others are sacrificing for the group (via high contribution or reward) or sacrificing to enforce norms (via punishment). This points to a type that monitors the environment enough to see that cooperation is stable and beneficial, and then “locks in” a personally satisfactory contribution that exploits some of the surplus generated by others’ generosity while avoiding extreme opportunism. Their social style is quiet and self-contained: they neither coordinate with prosocial players nor escalate conflict with punishers, and they maintain their own rule-of-thumb strategy regardless of others’ detailed outcomes.", "umap_x": 1.0981364250183105, "umap_y": -0.9912965297698975, "cluster_id": 6, "cluster_size": 31, "cluster_title": "Punishment / Reward / Contribution", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around punishment, reward, contribution, contributions, low."}
{"experiment": "2CpmMrTnRYQhD69qN", "participant": "bQirT5AvqT5wycWYj", "game_finished": true, "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a perfectly stable, moderate contributor. They always contribute exactly half of their endowment and never adjust this level despite substantial variation in others’ behavior, total contributions, and final payoffs. Their strategy is simple and rule-like: “I put in a fair, middle amount every time,” with no detectable experimentation or trend over the game. They do not try to match the group’s average, do not escalate to full cooperation when others are highly cooperative, and do not drop toward free-riding when others’ contributions fall. This indicates a strong internal fairness norm anchored at “half,” combined with low reactivity to social or payoff signals. They appear risk-averse with respect to strategy change: once they find a behavior that yields solid payoffs, they stick to it, even though higher contributions would raise group and personal returns given the multiplier. They prioritize steadiness and simplicity over payoff maximization and do not appear to condition their contributions on any specific peer’s behavior.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThis player never uses punishment, despite repeated opportunities and clear variation in others’ contribution levels, including occasional low contributions by peers and visible use of punishment by others. Their inaction persists regardless of whether some players contribute less than the group norm or whether punishment might have been effective at disciplining a specific target. This suggests a strong reluctance to incur personal costs to harm others, even for potential norm enforcement. They do not appear motivated by retaliation, do not mimic others’ punitive strategies, and do not engage in second-order punishment (punishing non-punishers). The pattern is consistent with a non-punitive, harm-averse type that prefers to let the contribution structure “speak for itself” rather than enforcing norms through costly sanctions. Whether this is due to moral discomfort with harming others, skepticism about the effectiveness of punishment, or simple self-interest in avoiding costs remains unknown.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nThis player is never punished during the game, so their direct behavioral response to identifiable punishers is unknown. There is no evidence of pre-emptive adaptation to avoid punishment; their contribution level is unchanging from the start and does not react to others’ sanctioning patterns. Given their stable, moderate contributions and non-punitive stance, if they were punished in a future setting, one might expect low propensity for counter-punishment and a tendency to maintain their own norm-following behavior; however, this is speculative and confidence in this extrapolation is low.\n\n<REWARD>\nThis player never uses rewards, even when others contribute more than they do and when prosocial reward behavior is clearly present in the group. They do not invest to encourage high contributors, nor do they attempt to strategically reinforce allies or cultivate reciprocity. Their stance appears efficiency- and cost-focused at the individual level: they avoid spending coins on mechanisms that transfer payoff away from themselves, even when such transfers could plausibly improve future cooperation. They also show no sign of imitating others’ rewarding behavior. The absence of rewards, combined with steady moderate contributions, fits a “self-contained cooperator” profile: willing to contribute reliably to the public good but not willing to pay extra to manage others’ behavior through positive incentives.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThis player is never rewarded, so their direct reactions to identifiable rewarders are unknown. They do not adjust their contributions in response to the general presence of rewards in the environment; their behavior remains unchanged while others use rewards multiple times. There is no observable attempt to signal for future rewards by increasing contributions, nor any sign of forming implicit alliances with known rewarders. Whether they would reciprocate rewards via higher contributions or via counter-reward in another setting is unknown.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThis player observes substantial information each round: others’ contributions, payoffs, and costs spent on punishment and reward. Yet they display no behavioral adjustment in response. They do not increase contributions when others contribute very high amounts and group payoffs rise, and they do not decrease when others free-ride more or when punitive conflict escalates among others. They ignore both negative and positive incentive signals directed at other players and do not seem to take advantage of apparent “safe” opportunities to free-ride when cooperation stays high. This indicates low sensitivity to social comparison and low engagement with the strategic social dynamics. Their primary focus appears to be on maintaining a personally acceptable, predictable payoff stream rather than tailoring their behavior in response to others’ gains, losses, or enforcement activity. Overall, they behave as a stable, internally guided cooperator who treats others’ outcomes as background information rather than as cues for adaptation.", "umap_x": 1.2559685707092285, "umap_y": -0.9045311808586121, "cluster_id": 6, "cluster_size": 31, "cluster_title": "Punishment / Reward / Contribution", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around punishment, reward, contribution, contributions, low."}
{"experiment": "2CpmMrTnRYQhD69qN", "participant": "be9dLqkhDp6wZjbBo", "game_finished": true, "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a generally high contributor with moderate downward flexibility. They usually give more than or close to the group average, often at or near full contribution, but occasionally cut back substantially. Their baseline seems to be a “cooperative but not unconditional” stance: they appear willing to forego private payoff to support the public fund, especially when others also contribute strongly.\n\nContribution levels are not chaotic; they vary within a band rather than swinging between extremes every round. Larger drops occur after stretches where the player has already contributed a lot and/or engaged in costly punishment, suggesting some sensitivity to their own payoff position and possible “fatigue” with shouldering the cooperative burden alone.\n\nThey appear conditionally cooperative: when others continue to contribute at high and stable levels, they are happy to match or exceed that. When others’ average contributions sag but remain decent, the player sometimes reduces their own contribution while still staying within the cooperative range. They do not appear to exploit others’ very high contributions by repeatedly free-riding; low contributions are occasional and not a persistent strategy.\n\nThey seem to have a fairness norm centered on “everyone should at least give solid amounts.” Players who consistently give much more (especially full contributors) are treated as especially virtuous. The focal player tolerates some asymmetry but reacts sharply to one specific moderate contributor who also benefits from the public good without matching the cooperative effort of the highest contributors; this indicates a dislike of systematic advantage-taking rather than of any deviation per se.\n\nRisk tolerance seems moderate: they are willing to invest heavily into the public fund even without guarantees of reciprocity, but occasionally protect their own payoff by contributing less, especially after investing in costly punishment or when it is unclear whether high cooperation will persist.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThis player uses punishment actively but very selectively, focusing almost exclusively on a single target. They are clearly willing to incur personal costs to reduce another’s payoff, and they escalate the intensity over time. The target is not the lowest contributor in the group; instead, it is a consistent moderate contributor who tends to earn relatively high payoffs. The focal player does not punish other moderate or low contributors who play similarly, nor do they punish high contributors, indicating that they are not using punishment as a general tool to enforce uniform high contributions.\n\nTheir pattern is consistent with a personalized, norm‑enforcing or expressive motive toward that specific player: “you, in particular, should not be allowed to keep doing this.” The repeated focus and occasional escalation suggest they are trying to influence that player’s behavior or reduce an outcome they see as unfair, rather than simply venting once. The absence of punishment toward anyone else, even when they contribute similarly, shows high selectivity and some internal rule about who “deserves” sanctions.\n\nThere is no evidence of retaliatory punishment, because the focal player is never punished by others. Accordingly, their punishment motive cannot be described as revenge‑driven. Instead, it appears mixed: partly inequity aversion (dislike of that player’s relatively favorable payoff position given their contributions), and partly a desire to deter that player from continuing a pattern the focal player finds objectionable.\n\nThey are willing to spend substantial cumulative resources on punishment, even when it reduces their own payoff noticeably, which indicates that enforcing their perceived fairness standard can override short‑term self‑interest. At the same time, they eventually discontinue punishing once the target’s contributions and the overall group pattern become stable and acceptable to them, suggesting some capacity to “declare victory” or at least to stop escalating indefinitely.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nUnknown. The focal player is never punished in this transcript, so their reactions to being sanctioned—whether they would comply, retaliate, or forgive—cannot be inferred. Any assumptions about their response to punishment would be low confidence and speculative.\n\n<REWARD>\nThe player is clearly willing to reward and does so in a pattern consistent with “pro‑social reinforcement.” They direct rewards to those who contribute at or near full levels and who appear to sustain group welfare. They do not reward moderate or low contributors, even when those individuals are not being punished, indicating that their standard for positive reinforcement is reserved for the very cooperative.\n\nRewarding is intermittent: they do not reward every time someone contributes highly, nor do they reward all high contributors in a given round. This suggests they treat rewards as a targeted, somewhat scarce signal rather than an automatic rule. They may be using reward both to express appreciation and to encourage sustained high contributions from particular players who have been especially consistent.\n\nThere is no evidence they use rewards strategically to manipulate more selfish players into contributing more; instead, they focus on already‑good cooperators. That is more consistent with helping “heroes” than recruiting “defectors.” Given the positive payoff cost of rewarding, they accept a reduction in their own earnings to support and recognize high cooperators, but they do this sporadically rather than continuously, perhaps balancing altruistic signaling with payoff concerns.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nUnknown. The focal player is never rewarded by others in this transcript, so their behavioral or strategic response to receiving rewards—whether they would reciprocate, increase contributions, or form implicit alliances—cannot be inferred.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThe player pays close attention to others’ contributions and resulting payoffs and appears sensitive to the relationship between effort and reward. When high contributors earn moderate or even slightly lower payoffs than some moderate contributors, the focal player intervenes, particularly against the moderate contributor whose earnings often compare favorably despite giving less than the top cooperators. This implies strong outcome‑based fairness concerns with an emphasis on relative payoffs.\n\nThey never sanction or reward based purely on outcome size: they do not attack those with the very highest payoffs when these are paired with high contributions, nor do they protect lower earners if those are also low contributors. Their responses are tied to the pattern “contribution level vs. resulting payoff,” not payoff alone.\n\nThe player seems comfortable with a differentiated outcome structure where high cooperators do well, moderate cooperators do reasonably, and no one is singled out without a behavioral basis. Once the group settles into a stable, high‑contribution equilibrium and the previously targeted player behaves in line with that standard, the focal player stops using punishment and cuts back on reward use as well. That suggests that they primarily deploy sanctions and rewards as tools to adjust the group toward a desired cooperative and fair pattern, and when that pattern is achieved, they revert to simpler contribution decisions without extra costly interventions.\n\nOverall, this player type is a conditionally cooperative, fairness‑oriented enforcer who uses both reward and targeted punishment to shape others’ behavior and relative payoffs, prioritizing alignment between contributions and outcomes over maximizing their own earnings.", "umap_x": 0.3468829095363617, "umap_y": -1.202865481376648, "cluster_id": 6, "cluster_size": 31, "cluster_title": "Punishment / Reward / Contribution", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around punishment, reward, contribution, contributions, low."}
{"experiment": "2CpmMrTnRYQhD69qN", "participant": "dgD9YndT5WFPZRgzi", "game_finished": true, "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a generally high contributor who experiments with partial free-riding but does not fully defect. They start with full contributions and repeatedly return to full provision even after periods of contributing less, which suggests an internal norm favoring high cooperation rather than pure payoff-maximization. Over time, they increasingly vary their contribution amount, sometimes contributing notably less than most others, then moving back up again. This pattern indicates conditional cooperation in a loose, exploratory sense: they seem to adjust their own contribution when others’ average contributions drift down or when low contributors are punished, but they never drop to zero and rarely go to very low levels. They tolerate some inequity—being more generous than some others for many rounds—without using punishment or reward to change behavior. Their willingness to occasionally under-contribute relative to clear high contributors, while still benefiting from the public fund, shows some opportunism and risk tolerance: they test whether they can keep high payoffs while letting others carry more of the cooperative burden. However, because they frequently return to high contributions even when they could profitably keep free-riding, they appear motivated partly by a fairness or “do my share” norm, not just by short-term gain. Overall, they are a mostly-cooperative, mild opportunist who adapts contributions but avoids extreme defection.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThis player never uses punishment despite ample opportunities and a relatively efficient punishment technology. They refrain from punishing both persistent low contributors and those who impose heavy sanctions on others. This suggests a strong aversion to costly sanctions, whether for normative enforcement or retaliation. The absence of any “moralistic” punishment, even when some players clearly contribute less or when one player repeatedly targets a specific low contributor with escalating sanctions, implies that this player either does not feel responsible for enforcing fairness or doubts that punishment is worthwhile. Their behavior is consistent with a “live and let live” stance: they accept payoff differences and let others bear the cost of policing. There is no evidence of targeted or strategic deterrence; they do not punish in early rounds to shape behavior, nor later in response to persistent patterns. Personality-wise, this points to conflict avoidance and low taste for confrontation, even when it could be individually or collectively beneficial. If they consider the efficiency of punishment at all, they appear to judge the personal cost as not worth the expected benefits, or they simply avoid negative actions as a rule.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nThey are never punished in this game, so their direct response to being sanctioned is unknown. Because punishers are identifiable and one player uses substantial punishment on others, the fact that this player never joins in or mirrors those punishments suggests they do not align themselves with punishers or treat them as leaders to emulate. They also do not appear to “side” against heavily punished players by further punishing them. Thus, in the absence of personal experience of punishment, the best inference is that they neither reward nor reinforce punishers’ behavior and do not use others’ punitive actions as a cue for their own sanctions. Their likely response to a hypothetical punishment is uncertain; given their non-retaliatory baseline, retaliation is possible but not supported by evidence, so any claim beyond “unknown” would be low confidence.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey never reward anyone, even when some players clearly and consistently contribute more than others and sometimes incur personal costs policing the group. They also receive small rewards from others but do not reciprocate. This indicates they are not inclined to spend their own coins to positively reinforce cooperation or to build goodwill through gifts, despite reward being less harsh and more socially positive than punishment. Their strategy appears narrowly self-focused with respect to the optional mechanisms: they rely on the public good mechanism itself and on others’ use of reward/punishment, while personally free-riding on others’ incentive-provision. The lack of any symbolic or one-off rewarding, even in early phases where norms could be set, suggests that they do not view reward as part of their role in the group, and they are not trying to cultivate alliances or reputations via costly prosocial gestures. This points toward instrumental, cost-averse behavior around side-payments: they will cooperate via contribution, but they will not pay extra to shape others’ behavior.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThey are rewarded a few times by other players despite not using the reward mechanism themselves. After receiving rewards, they do not change their pattern in any clearly affiliative or reciprocal way: they do not begin rewarding, they do not unambiguously increase contributions toward the apparent rewarders beyond what they were already doing, and they do not adopt the rewarders’ sanctioning style. Their contributions remain generally high with some variation, consistent with their prior trend, and there is no sign of a step-change in behavior following rewards. This suggests they experience rewards more as windfall income than as social signals that demand reciprocation or loyalty. They do not appear to update into a coalition mindset (e.g., “I should now support those who support me”). As a type, they accept positive treatment without reciprocating in kind, and they do not use reward receipts as cues for alliance-building or reputation management. Their gratitude level is behaviorally unknown; what can be inferred is that gratitude, if felt, does not translate into costly reciprocal action.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey observe that some players consistently contribute high amounts and sometimes sacrifice payoff through punishment or reward, while others contribute less and are occasionally heavily punished, yet they remain behaviorally detached from these dynamics. They do not move to shield heavily punished players by rewarding them, nor do they join punishers to intensify sanctions. They also see that non-punishers and non-rewarders often achieve higher round payoffs than those who police the group; their own consistent choice to avoid both punishment and reward aligns with this payoff pattern, suggesting they are attentive to the net costliness of sanctions. They adapt their own contributions as group averages fluctuate, but this adaptation is relatively modest and does not track any single player’s treatment—more a response to overall environment than to specific individuals’ fortunes. Their attitude toward inequality in outcomes seems tolerant: they accept that some earn more due to low contribution or due to not spending on sanctions, and that some earn less due to punishing, without intervening. Overall, they behave as a pragmatic cooperator who lets others manage social control while they adjust their own contribution levels to maintain good payoffs, showing low engagement with the social-emotional meaning of others’ costs and payoffs.", "umap_x": 0.7719812989234924, "umap_y": -1.1645398139953613, "cluster_id": 6, "cluster_size": 31, "cluster_title": "Punishment / Reward / Contribution", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around punishment, reward, contribution, contributions, low."}

They frequently give the entire endowment and otherwise hover modestly below the group average only when the general contribution climate looks weaker. They do not appear to condition sharply on small differences in others’ behavior; minor under-contribution by a few peers does not trigger strong downward adjustment. Instead, they maintain a relatively generous baseline that fluctuates within a narrow band, suggesting a blend of prosocial preference and mild strategic caution rather than strict tit‑for‑tat. They tolerate being among the top contributors even when it reduces their relative payoff, indicating low aversion to disadvantageous inequality and a willingness to absorb some exploitation if group contributions remain reasonably high. They do not escalate downward when overall contributions steadily fall; rather, they oscillate between full contribution and a moderate reduction, implying they value sustaining cooperation more than strictly maximizing short‑term earnings. Their choices do not indicate strong risk‑seeking or risk‑avoidant behavior; they stay with a simple, robust cooperative rule rather than experimenting widely.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey never use punishment despite the tool being powerful and relatively cost‑effective. This holds even when some peers contribute noticeably less or when defectors are clearly earning higher payoffs. Their nonuse appears systematic rather than situational: even in environments where a strategic punisher might try to discipline low contributors or retaliate against free riders, they refrain. This suggests either a principled aversion to harming others, skepticism about the long‑term value of punishment, or a preference to let others bear any enforcement role. There is no evidence that they use punishment for either deterrence or retaliation. Their strategy seems to omit punishment entirely, not even as a late‑game or last‑resort tool. Overall, they are a non‑punishing cooperator.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nUnknown. The player is never punished, so there is no observed reaction. Their future contributions and continued refusal to punish do not allow inference about whether they would respond to punishment with compliance, retaliation, or indifference. Any characterization here would be speculative; confidence is low.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey never spend on rewards, even though they routinely observe others investing in positive incentives. This includes frequent cases where other players reward high contributors. Their abstention is consistent across both cooperative and more defect‑prone environments, suggesting that they treat rewarding, like punishment, as outside their strategy set. This likely reflects either a strong preference to avoid spending on social tools altogether, a belief that cooperation can be sustained without explicit reinforcement, or a narrow focus on maximizing personal payoff subject to maintaining their own cooperative standard. They do not engage in alliance‑building via rewards nor do they attempt to shape others’ behavior with positive incentives.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThey receive rewards on a few occasions from others who also appear highly cooperative. Their subsequent behavior does not change discernibly: they continue to contribute at similar or slightly varying cooperative levels and still never adopt rewarding themselves. There is no indication of reciprocal rewarding or targeted favoring of those who rewarded them, even though identities are observable. This suggests that, while they may privately appreciate the rewards (unknown), they do not convert gratitude into material reciprocity. Their cooperative pattern appears driven by an internal standard rather than contingent on being rewarded.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey consistently see others’ outcomes, including payoff differences driven by varying contributions and by some players’ use of punishment and reward. They do not mimic the enforcers’ behavior, nor do they react visibly to shifting payoff ranks: even when defectors earn more, the player neither punishes nor heavily reduces contributions, and even when cooperators are supported by rewards, they do not join in reinforcing them. This points to low sensitivity to outcome inequality and to others’ sanctioning choices. They adapt their own contributions slightly to the general contribution climate, but they ignore the “second‑order” layer of who is punishing or rewarding whom and with what cost.

They do not anchor on a single contribution level; instead, they frequently shift between very low and very high contributions. They clearly understand that contributing can be profitable when others also contribute, because they repeatedly choose high contributions in environments where group contributions appear strong. At the same time, they are comfortable free-riding and sometimes take the full endowment while still benefiting from others’ cooperation.\n\nTheir contributions track the perceived cooperativeness of the group in a broad, qualitative way: when others as a whole appear generous, the player is generally willing to join in, though rarely as the most altruistic member. When the group seems more mixed or deteriorating, they reduce their own contribution sharply, sometimes down to zero, even if cooperation has not completely collapsed. They do not insist on strict equality or fairness; they tolerate contributing more than many low contributors around them at times, and at other times they themselves are among the least generous while others are still contributing substantially. This suggests weak or flexible fairness norms: they care about payoff-relevant conditions (is it lucrative to contribute now?) more than about matching others exactly.\n\nRisk-wise, the player shows a willingness to “gamble” on high contributions when the environment looks cooperative, accepting the immediate personal sacrifice for the expectation of a good group return. However, they do not sustain high contributions unconditionally. Their pattern indicates a payoff-sensitive, opportunistic stance rather than a principled commitment to cooperation or a strict free-riding strategy.\n\nOverall, they are a payoff-oriented conditional cooperator: willing to support the public good when it seems profitable and somewhat socially supported, but quick to scale back and free-ride when they sense fragility or unevenness in group contributions. Their strategy is adaptive rather than rigid, but also noisy and inconsistent, suggesting that they update heuristically rather than following a clear, stable rule.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThe player appears aware that the game has a finite horizon, but they do not exhibit a simple linear decay or a pure “end-spurt” of defection. In the final portion of the game, they continue to vary their contributions, sometimes contributing very little and sometimes at moderate-to-high levels. They do not switch into a pure defector mode in the last few rounds, nor do they escalate to full cooperation as a final gesture.\n\nInstead, their late-game behavior remains conditional and opportunistic: they adjust contributions up when the group as a whole still looks reasonably cooperative, and they reduce them when the environment seems more mixed or deteriorating, even very close to the final round. This implies that, even when the end is near, their primary reference remains the current cooperative climate and expected payoff, not a strict backward-induction logic or a moral norm about “finishing strong.”\n\nIn short, their end-game strategy continues the same pattern as earlier: flexible conditional cooperation with intermittent free-riding, rather than a clear terminal collapse or a final cooperative surge.", "umap_x": -1.5582823753356934, "umap_y": 0.6231050491333008, "cluster_id": 1, "cluster_size": 27, "cluster_title": "Contributions / Contribution / Cooperation", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around contributions, contribution, cooperation, group, high."}

Across the game, they overwhelmingly choose zero contribution, punctuated by a small number of rounds where they give the full endowment. This creates a bimodal profile: either full cooperation or complete defection, with no intermediate levels.\n\nThey appear payoff‑oriented and attentive to the group’s average contribution. When others are broadly cooperative and average contributions are high, they occasionally match that with a full contribution, but they do not maintain that level; they quickly revert to taking everything once they have confirmed that others continue to give. This suggests strategic, opportunistic free riding rather than a stable commitment to fairness or efficiency.\n\nThere is no evidence of adherence to proportionality or reciprocity norms in a consistent way. The player does not gradually adjust contributions to “meet others halfway”; instead, they exploit the public good for most of the game while occasionally injecting full contributions when cooperation is already strong. This looks more like testing or stabilizing a high-contribution regime that they can then profit from by defecting again, rather than a fairness-driven impulse.\n\nRisk tolerance appears moderate: they are willing to risk full contributions in already cooperative environments, presumably because the marginal loss from contributing in that context is smaller relative to the large group return. They avoid such risks when cooperation is already eroding, preferring safe free riding to attempting to rebuild trust through further contributions. Their pattern suggests instrumental rather than moralized cooperation: they cooperate when it looks likely to be lucrative, not to enforce a principle.\n\nThe strategy is conditionally cooperative in a narrow, one-sided sense: they sometimes cooperate when others are cooperative, but they do not uphold a norm of mutuality. Once they see a cooperative environment forming, they treat it as an opportunity to defect in surrounding rounds rather than as something to protect. This aligns with a “calculating exploiter” type who understands public-goods incentives and positions themselves to benefit disproportionately from others’ prosociality.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThe player shows clear awareness of the finite horizon. Their contribution pattern does not shift into sustained cooperation at the end; instead, they largely maintain their default of zero contribution through the final stretch and do not exhibit a last‑round “gift” or attempt to influence future reputation (which is meaningless here). There is no visible end-game escalation of cooperation.\n\nTheir sporadic full contributions continue to appear interspersed with many zeroes across the later part of the game, but these cooperative spikes are not concentrated at the end and do not increase as the game approaches its conclusion. This supports the view that the player’s occasional cooperation is situationally motivated by local conditions (e.g., others’ high contributions) rather than shaped by long-run future interaction concerns.\n\nIn the final rounds, they do not attempt to rebuild or amplify group cooperation even when others continue to contribute substantial amounts. This suggests they internalize the classic end-game logic of public goods and prioritize extracting value over sustaining norms once the horizon is short. Their type in new environments is therefore best modeled as horizon-aware, strategically free riding in late stages, and not prone to sentimental or reputational “last-round generosity” in the absence of explicit future benefits.", "umap_x": -1.2138551473617554, "umap_y": 0.831335186958313, "cluster_id": 1, "cluster_size": 27, "cluster_title": "Contributions / Contribution / Cooperation", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around contributions, contribution, cooperation, group, high."}

They overwhelmingly choose the maximum possible contribution and maintain this choice across almost the entire game, with a single, isolated deviation where they keep their full endowment for themselves and then immediately revert to full contributions thereafter. This pattern suggests that their default policy is “always contribute fully,” rather than finely tuning their behavior to momentary payoff changes.\n\nThey appear willing to contribute at high levels even when others’ average contributions are relatively low and volatile. They do not systematically match the group’s average, nor do they visibly punish low contributors by reducing their own contribution after seeing free-riding. Instead, they continue to put in the maximum, indicating low sensitivity to short-term exploitation risk and a high tolerance for contributing in mixed groups that include defectors.\n\nTheir contributions track more with a social or efficiency norm (“it is good to fully contribute”) than with strict reciprocity to individual others. They do not selectively respond to particular peers’ changes in contributions; when others fluctuate between low and high cooperation, this player’s contribution remains essentially constant. The brief instance of zero contribution does not trigger a lasting strategic shift, which suggests either an experiment with self-interest, a momentary test of what happens if they free-ride, or a short-lived reaction to previous low group contributions. Since they promptly return to maximal giving and then stay there, the most consistent interpretation is that they identify as a cooperator and regard the deviation as an exception rather than a new rule.\n\nThey show no sign of gradually decaying contributions as the game progresses. High contributions persist through early, middle, and late phases despite significant variation in the group’s behavior. This indicates strong internal cooperation norms and low volatility: they neither escalate nor withdraw in a tit-for-tat manner, and they do not chase the profit-maximizing individual strategy of persistent low contribution despite having enough opportunities to reconsider.\n\nTheir fairness norms appear to favor collective efficiency over strict payoff equality. They continue to invest heavily even in the presence of repeat low contributors, which implies they accept some inequity in individual payoffs if the group output stays reasonably high. Risk tolerance is high in social terms: they accept being exploited by free riders rather than adopting defensive defection. From the perspective of classic PGG typologies, they most closely resemble a “strong altruistic cooperator” or “norm-driven unconditional cooperator” with only very limited and quickly reversed experimentation with defection.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nAwareness of the game horizon does not meaningfully erode this player’s cooperation.

Instead, their cooperative stance is maintained right through the final decision.\n\nThey do not attempt to exploit the group in the final round by dropping their contribution, even though doing so would be individually profitable and cannot be punished or rewarded in future interactions. This suggests that their strategy is not based on backward induction about future payoffs, but on a more time-invariant rule or internal standard (“I contribute fully in this kind of game”). Their behavior is consistent with a player who either does not prioritize horizon-based optimization or who values maintaining a cooperative identity or principle more than capturing the one-shot gain from late defection.\n\nThe absence of contribution decay near the end of the game also indicates that they either do not expect others to massively defect in the final rounds, or, if they do, they still choose to cooperate despite that expectation. In either case, the looming end does not shift them into a more self-interested mode.

Instead, they appear to adopt a simple, robust rule—“always contribute the maximum”—and stick with it.\n\nThe one zero-contribution instance suggests they understand the incentives and are capable of strategic deviation. However, since they promptly return to full giving, the dominant driver seems to be a strong cooperative or efficiency-oriented norm rather than profit-maximizing self-interest. They behave as if they prioritize the group’s total payoff and are comfortable bearing the cost of contributing even when others free-ride.\n\nThey do not condition their behavior much on others’ average contributions: they continue to give maximally when others’ contributions are both high and low. This indicates low responsiveness to short-term fairness violations and a high tolerance for free-riding around them. Their fairness norm appears to be “I do my part regardless,” rather than “I match what others do.”\n\nRisk tolerance toward exploitation is high: they repeatedly expose themselves to being taken advantage of by low contributors and do not self-protect by reducing their own giving. They act as if the moral or strategic value they place on maintaining cooperation outweighs concerns about being treated unfairly.\n\nBelief-wise, they likely infer that contributions are socially desirable and that enough others will contribute that their own giving is worthwhile, even if not everyone cooperates.

Contributions move between very high levels and much lower ones, without settling into a simple rule like “always match the group average” or “always give half.” However, the lows never reach consistent full defection; minimal contributions appear sporadically and are interspersed with renewed high giving. This suggests experimentation and mood/assessment shifts more than a stable low-cooperation identity.\n\nThe player reacts to the cooperation climate: when the group appears strongly cooperative, they frequently respond with high or near-max contributions, fitting a conditional cooperator profile. When they see weaker or mixed cooperation, they sometimes pull back sharply, contributing little while still collecting a substantial payoff from others’ efforts. These opportunistic reductions are not sustained, indicating they balance self-interest with some internal norm of “doing their part” and possibly with ongoing learning about what yields good returns.\n\nTheir fairness norm seems asymmetric: they tolerate contributing more than many peers and do not consistently punish low-contributing environments by switching into permanent defection. At the same time, they appear willing to “test” lower contributions when they perceive others not fully aligned with strong cooperation. This reflects a norm of “contribute generously, but don’t be a sucker indefinitely.”\n\nRisk tolerance is moderate to high in the social sense. They repeatedly stake large portions of their endowment on the public fund in an environment where others’ reliability is uncertain, which exposes them to the risk of being exploited. At the same time, their intermittent low contributions show they are not blindly altruistic; they are willing to protect their own payoff when conditions feel less trustworthy or when they test whether the group will maintain cooperation without their full input.\n\nOverall, this player is best described as a pro-social, payoff-aware conditional cooperator: usually willing to contribute a lot, sensitive to group behavior, occasionally opportunistic, and comfortable with fluctuating between generous and protective stances.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThe player shows clear horizon awareness: their behavior in the final stretch does not collapse into pure defection but becomes more jagged and exploratory.

The pattern indicates they understand that contributing to the public fund can be profitable when others also contribute, but they are unwilling to lock into unconditional high contributions.\n\nTheir contributions are clearly conditional on perceived group behavior. When they observe widespread high contributions, they often match or come close to the cooperative norm with high or full contributions. When contributions around them become more mixed or partially defecting, they reduce their own giving to a mid-level amount or even drop to zero. This suggests they track the group’s cooperative climate and adjust to avoid being the “sucker” in an uncooperative environment.\n\nThey display neither pure altruism nor pure self-interest. Instead, they seem to balance personal payoff with a preference for maintaining a productive group fund. The choice of a mid-level contribution (rather than always going to one extreme) suggests a “hedging” mentality: they seek to retain some private income while still supporting the public fund enough to benefit from others’ cooperation.\n\nThere is no clear trend of monotonic decline or escalation; instead, their behavior is volatile but structured. The alternation between full contributions, half contributions, and occasional free-riding appears responsive rather than random. They show moderate risk tolerance: they are willing to fully contribute in uncertain environments when others appear cooperative but also willing to sharply pull back when cooperation looks fragile or unevenly shared.\n\nFairness norms appear “reciprocal but not punitive.” The player does not consistently insist on strict proportionality, but they do seem to require that others contribute non-trivially to justify their own high contributions. When many others give a lot, they tend to cooperate strongly; when they observe several low or zero contributions, they permit themselves to free-ride or drop to a safer mid-level. This is consistent with a conditional cooperator who mixes in opportunistic phases rather than a rigid fairness absolutist.\n\nOverall, their type can be described as a payoff-sensitive conditional cooperator with moderate volatility, who is willing to lead or support cooperation when it is widely shared but also periodically exploits cooperative groups to boost individual earnings.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThe player shows clear awareness of the finite horizon and uses the late game to experiment and occasionally exploit, rather than following a simple end-game collapse.

There is no evidence of intermediate or gradual adjustments. This binary pattern suggests a simple, rule-like strategy rather than fine-grained calibration.\n\nThey frequently free-ride in the presence of substantial contributions by others. When others are contributing enough to generate sizable returns, the player often takes the entire endowment and relies on the group to fund the public account.

This is consistent with conditional cooperation in an opportunistic form: the player is willing to help maintain a high-cooperation environment when it appears robust, but is not willing to be a “sucker” when cooperation weakens.\n\nThe player shows no loyalty to cooperative norms once cooperation wavers.

Their risk tolerance seems relatively high regarding trusting the group: they repeatedly expose themselves to the risk of being exploited and do not hedge by contributing intermediate amounts during most of the horizon. Fairness norms appear to be present in the sense that they support a high-contribution regime, but these norms are not strict enough to prevent an eventual switch to self-serving low contributions once the end is near.\n\nOverall, they behave like an intrinsically cooperative type who adopts a simple, generous strategy early and mid-game, with a calculated, non-gradual shift toward selfishness close to the end, rather than a constantly conditional or spasmodically reactive contributor.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThe player clearly exhibits horizon awareness and an end-game effect.\n\nFor the majority of the game, they maintain full cooperation, even when others’ contributions vary and when free-riding is evident. This persistence implies that the eventual drop in contributions is not driven by ongoing disappointment or gradual erosion of trust, but is more tightly linked to the knowledge that the game is finite and approaching its conclusion.\n\nAs the remaining number of rounds becomes small, they shift from their long-standing pattern of full contribution to low or zero contributions. This transition is abrupt rather than incremental, indicating a deliberate strategic pivot rather than a slow decay in cooperation. Once they start reducing contributions near the end, they do not revert back to a fully cooperative stance in the final round, instead moving to complete free-riding at the very end. This aligns with a classic end-game defection pattern: they take advantage of the group’s continued cooperation when reputational or future-round concerns are nearly irrelevant.\n\nThe pattern suggests that earlier cooperation is likely sustained by a mix of intrinsic prosocial preference and forward-looking reasoning (“cooperate while many rounds remain, because mutual cooperation is valuable”), whereas the final-round choices reveal that, given a clear horizon and no punishment/reward mechanisms, they are willing to exploit the public good when future consequences are negligible. Their end-game behavior therefore shows that they are not a pure unconditional cooperator; they are a conditional cooperator whose condition is primarily tied to time horizon and future-interaction value, rather than directly to fine-grained observation of others’ current contributions.", "umap_x": -1.244208812713623, "umap_y": 0.6286789774894714, "cluster_id": 1, "cluster_size": 27, "cluster_title": "Contributions / Contribution / Cooperation", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around contributions, contribution, cooperation, group, high."}

This pattern suggests they recognize and respond to the marginal per-capita return: they behave as if they understand that contributing is collectively efficient and often act in favor of that efficiency, but they are not purely altruistic. The one clear free-riding instance—taking the entire endowment while others continue to contribute heavily—indicates a willingness to exploit strong public cooperation at least occasionally.\n\nContribution choices are somewhat volatile but not erratic: they vary within a constrained band (from full free-ride in one case up to full contribution, and otherwise mostly medium–high amounts). Changes appear to be conditional on recent group behavior, not random. When the environment looks highly cooperative, the player tends to sustain or raise contributions, but they also sometimes “reward” a very cooperative environment by temporarily taking more for themselves, suggesting a self-interested balancing rather than a strict fairness rule.\n\nFairness norms are present but flexible. The player often contributes in a way that is roughly proportionate to the apparent group effort and does not systematically undercut high contributors. However, they do not insist on matching the most generous peers; they appear comfortable being slightly below the top cooperators while still contributing enough to support the public fund. This points to a norm of “doing one’s share” rather than “leading by example at all costs.”\n\nRisk tolerance appears moderate. The player is repeatedly willing to put substantial amounts at stake even when some others defect or contribute very little, indicating some tolerance for the risk of being exploited. Yet the occasional downward adjustment and the isolated full free-ride show that they also hedge against being the “sucker” and are attentive to payoff implications.\n\nOverall, their strategy is best characterized as adaptive conditional cooperation: they prioritize group efficiency and are usually generous, but they retain enough flexibility to protect their own payoff and to occasionally test how much they can benefit from others’ contributions.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThe player shows awareness of the finite horizon but does not strongly unravel their cooperation near the end.

Their behavior suggests that they either discount the classical backward-induction logic, prioritize maintaining a cooperative norm for its own sake, or simply continue to apply the same myopic, round-by-round conditional rule without special adjustment for the fact that the game is ending.\n\nThe absence of a sharp final-round free-ride, and the presence of a high final contribution, implies that they do not treat the end-game as a unique opportunity to exploit the group.

When contributions from others drop or become more uneven, they revert to zero. This suggests that they recognizes the efficiency of the public good and is willing to participate when they perceive a reliably cooperative environment, but they are not willing to be a “pillar” of cooperation when others seem less committed.\n\nContribution levels show a limited range of voluntary sacrifice. They move between no contribution, partial contributions roughly around half the endowment, and, more rarely, full contributions. The willingness to sometimes give up the whole endowment, but only in cooperative contexts, indicates moderate risk tolerance with strong reliance on social cues: they take the “risk” of contributing more only when free-riding risk appears low because many others are contributing heavily.\n\nThey does not appear to enforce or follow a strict fairness norm like “match the group average” or “always give half.” Instead, they behaves more like a cautious opportunist: they exploits cooperative periods by sometimes free-riding and sometimes joining in, and they systematically exploit low-contribution periods by not contributing. There is no evidence that they tries to lead the group toward higher cooperation; rather, they adapts to it when it exists and withdraws support when it weakens.\n\nOverall, their cooperation is unstable and reactive.

Their contribution is typically below the modal high contributors yet far above consistent free-riders, suggesting a “moderate cooperator” or “tempered contributor” type.\n\nTheir behavior is weakly conditional on others: when the group swings from very high to much lower cooperation, they do not systematically ramp up or cut back. The single upward deviation coincides with a generally high-cooperation environment, which may indicate some weak positive reciprocity or a test of slightly higher giving, but they quickly revert to their baseline. There is no evidence of punitive withholding or retaliatory under-contribution when others defect.\n\nThey show no signs of risk-seeking experimentation (e.g., trying extreme contributions or zero) despite substantial variation in group behavior and returns. This points to moderate risk aversion and a preference for predictability over chasing marginal gains.\n\nTheir fairness norm seems to be “steady, reasonable contribution” rather than strict matching. They neither try to maximize their own payoff at the group’s expense nor sacrifice a lot to match the highest cooperators. They tolerate the presence of both strong cooperators and low contributors without visibly adjusting, so they likely accept some payoff inequality as the cost of sticking to a simple personal rule.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThis player shows no classic end-game unraveling.

They usually match or exceed the group’s average rather than undercut it when they are in a cooperative phase, implying a fairness‑oriented norm when they are engaged in the social dilemma.\n\nTheir contributions are not monotonic; they alternate between high and zero contributions across the game. These switches align with changes in group behavior and recent punishment history, indicating strategic responsiveness rather than random play. They do not appear to maximize narrow self‑interest at all times: in many situations they choose high contributions that leave them vulnerable to being exploited or punished, so material payoff is important but not the sole driver. They show no strong evidence of risk aversion or risk seeking; instead, their risk tolerance appears context‑dependent, increasing when cooperation looks stable and decreasing when they perceive instability or hostility.

Cooperation decays rather than escalates at the end. In the final phase, they move away from consistent high contributions toward zero or reduced contributions, exhibiting a classic end‑game effect: with fewer future rounds to benefit from reputation or norm enforcement, they become more willing to free‑ride.\n\nThis shift suggests that their earlier cooperation is at least partly strategic—aimed at sustaining mutual gains over multiple rounds—rather than purely intrinsic altruism. When the remaining number of rounds is small, they increasingly prioritize immediate personal payoff over maintaining cooperative norms, indicating a forward‑looking but finite‑horizon mindset. They do not attempt a late “moral signal” of continued high cooperation in the final decision; instead, they align with a payoff‑maximizing exit strategy once future reciprocity is effectively unavailable.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThe player uses punishment sparingly and selectively. They mostly refrain from punishing, even when others contribute less than they do, implying that they do not have a strong, automatic drive to sanction all norm violators. When they do spend on punishment, it appears targeted rather than diffuse; they are willing to incur a nontrivial cost to impose significant deductions on specific individuals. This indicates that they view punishment as a tool for either enforcing norms or expressing disapproval, not as something to deploy routinely.\n\nBecause they punish in only a minority of opportunities, and only after having experienced notable deductions themselves, their motive is ambiguous between norm enforcement and retaliation. There is some indication that punishment is tied to frustration with particular partners rather than pure concern for group efficiency. They do not escalate into repeated or large punishment campaigns, suggesting limits to vindictiveness and a preference to contain conflict. They also do not use punishment to reward or protect high contributors (as reward is unavailable and they do not “counter‑punish” low punishers), so their sanctioning is focused on negative behavior, not on building alliances. Overall, they are a reluctant punisher who intervenes occasionally when provoked or when inequities become salient.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nThe player is repeatedly punished across the game and appears to notice and react to this, but not in a simple or purely compliant way. They do not consistently respond to being punished by increasing contributions; in some subsequent decisions they continue to contribute at high levels, while in others they reduce or drop their contributions. This pattern suggests that punishment does not straightforwardly train them into stable cooperation. Instead, they sometimes comply and sometimes withdraw cooperation, depending on the broader context.\n\nThey also occasionally punish others after experiencing deductions, indicating a willingness to answer sanctions with counter‑sanctions in at least some instances. This hints at a mixture of deterrence sensitivity and retaliatory impulse: they do not passively accept being targeted, yet they also do not spiral into unrestrained revenge. Since punishers are identifiable, their continued willingness to cooperate in some later rounds with likely punishers reflects partial forgiveness or at least pragmatic tolerance when cooperation still seems beneficial. Their stance toward punishers is thus mixed: they neither consistently reward them with higher compliance nor systematically retaliate; instead, they adjust both contributions and occasional punishment in a nuanced, context‑dependent way.

Early on, the player contributes substantially less than the group average while still participating in the public fund, indicating a willingness to free‑ride when others appear generous. As the game progresses, they occasionally match or approach high cooperative norms, but these higher contributions are not stable; they intersperse generous rounds with clear downshifts back to low giving. Their behavior suggests they adjust contributions in light of observed group behavior and perhaps recent punishment dynamics, rather than following a fixed rule.\n\nThey do not appear to follow a strict fairness norm such as “match the average” or “equalize contributions”; instead, they sometimes contribute much less than high contributors, and at other times contribute at or near the maximum even when others are mixed. This pattern is consistent with a player who is exploring payoff‑relevant strategies under uncertainty about others, rather than a principled fairness maximizer. Risk tolerance is moderate: they are willing to deviate visibly from cooperative norms (both upward and downward) despite identifiable punishment, but they also show some responsiveness to how cooperative the group looks, suggesting they weigh the risk of sanctions against potential gains from free‑riding or from sustaining the public good. Their contribution path is best described as adaptive and somewhat opportunistic rather than stable or purely self‑interested.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThe player shows awareness of the finite horizon: near the end, their contributions decline after periods of higher cooperation. Instead of ramping up giving to “leave on a good note,” they move toward lower contributions again, consistent with standard end‑game defection logic. However, this shift is not a sudden collapse from consistently high cooperation; it is a return to lower giving after a sequence of mixed strategies. There is no clear attempt to use the final round(s) to repay kindness, repair norms, or retaliate strongly; rather, the end phase fits a pattern of continued experimentation with some inclination to keep more for themselves once only a few rounds remain. Overall, they display some cooperation decay toward the end, but overlaying an already volatile pattern, making precise inference of horizon thinking low confidence beyond “they do not lock into full cooperation as the game closes.”\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThe player is a frequent and relatively heavy user of punishment, willing to incur substantial personal costs to sanction others across many stages of the game. Punishment is not confined to clear, extreme free‑riders: they also punish in contexts where others appear highly cooperative, implying that their criteria for sanctioning are broader than simply “very low contributors.” It is plausible (but not certain) that they target specific individuals whose contributions they perceive as systematically lower or norm‑violating relative to others in the same round, rather than indiscriminately sanctioning everyone. However, there is at least one phase in which they refrain from punishing despite the presence of conspicuously low contributions, which suggests their use of punishment is selective and contextual, not automatic.\n\nThe repeated willingness to spend more than the minimum on punishment indicates an enforcement‑oriented mindset: they seem to treat punishment as a tool to shape others’ behavior or to express disapproval, rather than as a last‑resort, purely payoff‑maximizing decision. Whether they aim primarily at efficiency (deterrence) or at expressing frustration/resentment is unknown. Given the presence of pro‑social and anti‑social punishment both being common in such environments, and since they sometimes punish when they themselves are relatively low contributors, they may engage in both norm enforcement and competitive/hostile punishment at different times. Overall, they are a punishment‑prone, non‑pacifist player who accepts efficiency losses to influence others.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nWhen they are punished, their subsequent behavior does not show a simple, consistent compliance response such as “I was punished, so I permanently raise my contributions” or “I was punished, so I stop punishing.” After receiving a sanction, they later choose both high and low contribution levels again, and they resume using punishment themselves. This suggests they do not interpret punishment solely as a credible deterrent that must be obeyed; instead, they seem to treat it as one signal among many, or possibly as an unfair or contested action that does not fully dictate their strategy.\n\nThere is no clear evidence of direct retaliation against specific punishers, although the data do not reveal their exact punishment targets, so retaliation cannot be ruled out. What can be said is that they do not become passive or withdraw from the punishment mechanism after being targeted. Nor do they clearly “forgive” in the sense of shifting into stable high cooperation; instead, they continue their mixed pattern of contributions and enforcement. Their response profile is best described as emotionally or strategically resilient: being punished does not visibly silence their willingness to punish others, nor does it lock them into a submissive, norm‑following contribution level.

Their pattern shows conditional cooperation with a prosocial baseline: they are willing to contribute a lot if they see others doing the same, and they do not require perfect symmetry to stay generous. They appear to care about fairness but not in a rigid “exact matching” way; they tolerate some variation as long as there is no blatant exploitation.

This suggests they either discount the classic backward‑induction logic or give weight to intrinsic or fairness motives that persist even when future retaliation or reward is impossible. There is no evidence of a strategic “last‑round grab”; instead, their end‑game response looks like a cautious reduction in generosity under uncertainty, not a collapse of cooperation. Overall, end‑game awareness is present but does not dominate their cooperative disposition.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThe player is willing to use costly punishment selectively. They do not punish every deviation, but they do sometimes pay to impose deductions. Given that punishment is costly and relatively powerful, their occasional use suggests they value norm enforcement or retaliation enough to sacrifice payoff at times. The timing of their punishment choices is consistent with responding to perceived unfairness or norm violations rather than punishing randomly. They do not appear to be a relentless enforcer; they leave some low or zero contributions unpunished, implying some threshold before they act—possibly when they see either particularly stark under‑contribution relative to others or a pattern they interpret as intentional exploitation. Their punishment behavior is infrequent enough that they are not spiteful or punishment‑focused by default; instead, they resemble a conditional punisher who intervenes when cooperation is threatened or when they feel clearly wronged. Whether they aim mainly at deterrence (to improve future group contributions) or at expressing disapproval/retaliation is uncertain, but the fact that punishment appears even when they themselves have not been heavily exploited by the target suggests at least some norm‑enforcing motive, not purely self‑protection. Overall, they are a moderate, selective punisher with a fairness and reciprocity orientation.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nThe player is punished multiple times. Their behavioral response is not to disengage or switch to opportunistic low contributions; instead, after being punished they continue to contribute at high levels in subsequent rounds when cooperation around them looks viable. This indicates they do not react with simple spite or immediate retaliation against the punisher(s). They also do not show obvious appeasement behavior (like dramatically over‑contributing relative to others right after punishment), but they maintain or resume substantial contributions, which can be interpreted as cooperative resilience or partial compliance with an inferred norm of higher giving. Their use of punishment after having been punished themselves suggests they do not categorically reject punishment as illegitimate; they seem to accept it as part of the interaction repertoire. There is no clear evidence that they target the same individuals who punished them (identity of punishers is not observable in the transcript), so we cannot reliably infer direct counter‑punishment or targeted revenge; that remains unknown. What is clear is that being punished does not cause them to abandon cooperation, and they remain willing to enforce norms themselves. In personality terms, they respond to punishment with robustness and continued engagement rather than withdrawal or clear retaliation, combining a willingness to punish with a relatively forgiving or at least forward‑looking cooperative stance.", "umap_x": -1.539559245109558, "umap_y": -0.6239498853683472, "cluster_id": 0, "cluster_size": 40, "cluster_title": "Punishment / Contributions / Contribution", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around punishment, contributions, contribution, norm, cooperation."}

Contributions range from none to full endowment, with no simple monotone trend. The player adjusts behavior in response to the group’s recent contribution pattern rather than following a fixed rule.\n\nThey sometimes match or exceed the apparent group norm when others are contributing substantially, but they also free-ride even in clearly cooperative environments. Conversely, they occasionally contribute very generously when surrounded by low or mixed contributions. This pattern suggests experimentation and local payoff-sensitivity rather than a stable fairness norm.\n\nThey does not appear to follow a strict “tit-for-tat” or “match-the-average” rule; instead, they oscillate between exploitative low contributions and pro-social high contributions, likely probing which strategy yields better returns. There is no clear evidence of strong inequality aversion or strict reciprocity norms, since they neither consistently match others’ levels nor systematically avoid being below or above peers. Risk tolerance seems moderate: they are willing to take payoff risks by contributing high even when recent treatment by the group is negative, implying that they do not purely optimize short-term income.\n\nOverall, they fit a “strategic experimenter / unstable conditional cooperator” type: sensitive to context and incentives, but without a firmly anchored social norm guiding contributions.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThe player shows no classical end-game defection pattern. Instead of ramping down cooperation near the final rounds, they continue to mix mid-range and maximal contributions, including very high giving at the very end despite prior negative treatment.\n\nThis suggests that horizon awareness does not dominate their strategy; they either discount the importance of the final-round payoff or maintain a cooperative or experimental stance regardless of remaining rounds. There is no clear evidence of increasing selfishness or tightening exploitation as the game approaches termination. If anything, their late-game behavior remains erratic and occasionally generous, indicating that they do not strongly condition on the finite horizon when choosing actions.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThe player never uses the punishment option, despite having multiple opportunities and facing both low-contributing peers and personal deductions imposed by others. They consistently refrain from spending on sanctions even when there are clear “targets” (e.g., low contributors or evident punishers).\n\nThis pattern indicates a strong reluctance to engage in costly punishment. They appear unwilling to trade off their own payoff to enforce norms, and there is no behavioral sign of using punishment for deterrence, retaliation, or norm expression. Their strategy treats the punishment technology as effectively irrelevant or too costly relative to its benefits.\n\nGiven the absence of any punishing action, underlying motives remain uncertain: they might disapprove of costly sanctions on moral grounds, doubt their effectiveness, or simply prioritize personal earnings. All of these remain speculative; the only robust inference is that they are a non-punisher even under provocation.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nThe player is repeatedly punished but never retaliates via the punishment mechanism, even though punishers are identifiable and punishment recurs across different contribution choices. They also do not reliably “comply” with an implied norm from punishers: sometimes they respond to previous negative treatment with higher contributions, sometimes with lower or unchanged levels. There is no stable shift toward either strict conformity or sustained defection after being sanctioned.\n\nTheir behavior thus suggests a mix of tolerance and independence. They do not use punishment for revenge and do not clearly adopt a submissive stance of norm-following in response to being targeted. Instead, they continue to adjust contributions in their own exploratory pattern, with limited observable deference to punishers’ signals.\n\nForgiveness versus indifference is unclear: they may internally register the unfairness or harshness of sanctions, but behaviorally they neither escalate conflict nor systematically accommodate the punishers’ likely preferences. Overall, they can be characterized as a non-retaliatory, strategically independent player who does not let identifiable punishment strongly dictate future actions.", "umap_x": -1.7931843996047974, "umap_y": -0.5135738849639893, "cluster_id": 0, "cluster_size": 40, "cluster_title": "Punishment / Contributions / Contribution", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around punishment, contributions, contribution, norm, cooperation."}

Their default is to give the maximum possible amount and they sustain this pattern through essentially the entire game, despite observing repeated under-contribution by at least one peer. This indicates a strong prosocial or efficiency-oriented motive that is not easily undermined by free-riding.\n\nTheir contribution pattern is highly stable and predictable: maximum giving is the norm, while reductions are rare, discrete events rather than the start of a downward trend. These few low-contribution choices appear exploratory or retaliatory tests rather than a full strategy shift. Across the game, they repeatedly return to the maximum-contribution baseline immediately after such deviations, suggesting that high cooperation is their reference point.\n\nThey exhibit some conditionality: they do occasionally free-ride or partially free-ride when others’ contributions drop or when the group has recently shown reliability. However, these episodes are sparse and short-lived. The player seems to be checking (a) how much personal gain is possible from defecting and (b) whether the group’s cooperation will collapse in response. Once they confirm that others remain largely cooperative, they revert to full contributions. This indicates that they value both payoff and group efficiency but prioritize sustaining cooperation over systematically exploiting it.\n\nNormatively, they appear to hold a strong fairness and efficiency norm that “everyone should give fully.” Their behavior is consistent with someone who treats full contribution as the socially appropriate baseline and tolerates some deviation by others without abandoning that norm. When they do deviate, they do not push the system toward full collapse; instead, they test the margin and quickly re-align with the high-contribution convention. This suggests they see themselves as a cooperator first, not as an opportunistic free-rider.\n\nRisk tolerance is moderately high in a social sense. Continuing to fully contribute even when a free-rider or partial free-rider is present exposes them to exploitation in the short run. They still take that risk, implying trust in the group’s overall cooperative orientation and/or a focus on maximizing total group returns rather than strictly securing their own relative advantage. At the same time, their rare defection episodes show they are not naive: they are aware of the payoff structure and are willing to temporarily prioritize self-gain, especially when they anticipate that group cooperation is robust enough to survive it.\n\nIn summary, this player is best characterized as a “principled high contributor with opportunistic tests”: they default to full cooperation, strongly support a high-contribution norm, occasionally probe the limits of that norm through brief free-riding or partial contributions, then reliably return to maximal giving once the test is complete.", "umap_x": -0.8475278615951538, "umap_y": 0.6054168343544006, "cluster_id": 1, "cluster_size": 27, "cluster_title": "Contributions / Contribution / Cooperation", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around contributions, contribution, cooperation, group, high."}

They usually give the full endowment when the group appears cohesive and generous, but intermittently drop their contribution well below the group norm to exploit others’ cooperation.\n\nTheir contribution pattern is moderately volatile rather than stable. Periods of full cooperation are punctuated by occasional medium contributions and a few very low or zero contributions. These reductions do not follow a simple “tit-for-tat” with individual defectors; instead, they reflect opportunistic tests of how much they can keep while still benefiting from a generally cooperative group.\n\nThey appear to understand that the public good is highly efficient and that full contribution is socially optimal, as evidenced by their repeated willingness to match a high-contribution environment. At the same time, they are clearly attentive to payoff differences and are willing to trade off social efficiency for personal gain when it looks safe to do so. This indicates a blend of cooperative preference and self-interested optimization rather than pure altruism or pure free-riding.\n\nFairness norms seem conditional and asymmetric. The player is willing to contribute fully for long stretches even when an isolated peer defects, suggesting a tolerance for some level of unfairness or a focus on maintaining group output over immediate reciprocity. However, when the group remains very cooperative, they sometimes drop their own contribution sharply while others keep contributing at or near the maximum. In those moments they violate strict equality norms in their own favor, implying that fairness is not a dominant motive when it conflicts strongly with personal payoff.\n\nThey show some responsiveness to visible defections but not in a purely retaliatory way. Isolated low contributions by others do not reliably trigger immediate punishment via their own defection; instead, the player continues to contribute highly through several such events and only occasionally reduces their own contribution later. This delayed and inconsistent adjustment suggests exploratory or profit-maximizing tinkering rather than emotionally driven reciprocity.\n\nRisk tolerance appears moderate. The player is willing to risk being the lone free-rider in an otherwise cooperative group in order to earn high payoffs, which involves reputational or moral risk in many PGG contexts (even though no sanctions are available here). Yet they do not persistently defect; they revert frequently to full contributions, indicating caution about undermining the group’s cooperative equilibrium and the resulting efficiency loss.

This pattern suggests they use a simple, rule-based strategy rather than fine-grained conditional cooperation.\n\nThey appear to anchor on the social optimum and maintain it even when others visibly free-ride or partially defect. Drops in group contributions, including clear low or zero contributions by multiple group members, do not produce retaliation or even moderate downward adjustment from this player.

They never use rewards punitively or manipulatively (the mechanism is symmetric cost/benefit), and their pattern suggests a primarily prosocial, norm-affirming intent: they are willing to incur small costs to encourage or acknowledge cooperative behavior but do not treat rewarding as a central or heavily strategic tool.", "umap_x": 1.5095270872116089, "umap_y": 1.126957654953003, "cluster_id": 7, "cluster_size": 36, "cluster_title": "Reward / Contributions / High", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around reward, contributions, high, rewards, contribution."}

They often give the entire endowment or half of it, rarely contributing very little. Their pattern suggests conditional cooperation: they appear more willing to give fully when others are also giving high amounts, and they reduce to a mid-level contribution when they either test or exploit a cooperative environment. They are not purely self-sacrificing; they balance own payoff with group returns and sometimes keep a substantial portion despite others’ full cooperation. Their behavior indicates awareness that high group contributions are profitable, but they are willing to deviate downward when they can still benefit from others’ generosity. Contribution choices are somewhat volatile but within a narrow band (medium vs. maximum), hinting at experimentation or mild strategic adjustment rather than random play. They appear comfortable taking advantage of a cooperative norm at times, but not to the extreme of contributing nothing. Their risk tolerance is moderate: they repeatedly invest heavily even after seeing others defect or fluctuate, implying they are willing to risk being the “sucker” occasionally to preserve or regain high group payoffs.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThe player communicates very little and only engages once the group has already established a norm and called attention to their behavior. They respond briefly and directly when someone questions their contribution, using a short reassurance that implicitly acknowledges group expectations and seeks validation.

Their tone is cooperative and non-confrontational; there is no sign of irritation or defensiveness, and they appear willing to align with the group once attention is on them. Overall, they adopt a low-visibility, reactive communication style: they monitor the chat, intervene minimally, and only speak when socially prompted.\n\n<REWARD>\nThe player uses rewards sparingly and selectively. They are willing to spend on rewards but do so infrequently, suggesting that they reserve rewarding for specific situations rather than routine reinforcement. Their first use of rewards occurs in a context where cooperation is already very high, indicating that they may use rewards more as a signal of appreciation or encouragement than as a tool to change poor behavior. They do not systematically reward every instance of strong cooperation, nor do they appear to run a consistent “reward-the-highest-contributor” strategy. They receive rewards in several cooperative contexts, which may reinforce their sense that contributing relatively high amounts is socially approved, but their own rewarding does not clearly escalate in response. Overall, they show a moderate willingness to reward, with no evidence of targeted strategic reinforcement or explicit gratitude signaling beyond the bare act of rewarding itself.

Early behavior shows a mix of very high and very low contributions, which aligns poorly with the surrounding group norm and suggests misunderstanding of the interface rather than deliberate exploitation. The player explicitly states that they have reversed the intended action and later apologizes; this makes it plausible that some low contributions during a period of group encouragement toward full contributions stem from misinterpretation rather than calculated free-riding (medium confidence).\n\nOnce they appear to understand the norm and mechanics better, they shift to consistently contributing their full endowment in the later phase of the game, aligning with a cooperation norm promoted by others. This indicates conditional cooperation: they are willing to bear substantial cost to match the group’s apparent consensus once they feel responsible for earlier deviations and once expectations are clear.\n\nTheir contribution pattern is volatile early on and stabilizes later. They oscillate between full contribution, partial contribution, and taking everything, which is inconsistent with a simple selfish or pure altruist type. The change toward stable full contributions following apologies and peer clarification suggests they update based on perceived group expectations and their own sense of having made a mistake.\n\nFairness norms appear to matter: when they perceive that the norm is to “put everything in,” they later try to align their behavior with that standard. They show no evidence of exploiting others once they understand the cooperative expectation, and they tolerate the personal risk of over-contributing relative to at least one slightly under-contributing peer. Risk tolerance regarding payoff variance is moderate to high: they are willing to forgo secure private payoffs in favor of matching a cooperative strategy that depends on others continuing to contribute.\n\nOverall, the player is best characterized as norm-following once norms are understood, with early deviations driven by confusion, not stable selfishness.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nTheir tone is friendly, polite, and deferential. They initiate a greeting once they notice the chat and respond in a socially appropriate, upbeat way, fitting a cooperative social style rather than a hostile or confrontational one. They later express explicit apologies and self-blame for previous misaligned actions, indicating concern about others’ perceptions and a desire to repair group trust.\n\nThey use chat primarily for social alignment and clarification rather than for persuasion or strategic manipulation. When other players advocate for full contributions, the player does not lead or argue; instead, they express that they had misunderstood and then quietly adjust behavior. This indicates a responsive rather than directive communication style.\n\nThey are attentive and reactive to group feedback. When another player indirectly criticizes low contributors and confusion emerges about who is at fault, the focal player queries their own status (“I am ?”) and later explains that they had reversed the meaning of the decision. This suggests they monitor how others interpret actions and care about being seen as cooperative.\n\nThey do not engage in explicit coordination proposals of their own but willingly endorse and follow others’ proposals once they understand them. They show no signs of trolling, sarcasm, or hostility. The overall communication style is conciliatory, self-correcting, and socially sensitive, with a mild tendency toward embarrassment when they realize earlier mistakes.\n\n<REWARD>\nThe player shows limited, somewhat puzzling use of the reward mechanism. On one occasion they spend a substantial amount of their own payoff to distribute rewards, even when rewards are cost-neutral at the margin. This suggests an attempt to actively encourage cooperation or express approval, but the pattern is too sparse to establish a stable “strong reciprocator” type (low confidence).\n\nThey otherwise almost never use rewards, even when others behave cooperatively. This could indicate that they either do not fully understand or notice the reward stage, or they do not view the reward tool as necessary or impactful. Given they explicitly mention reversing the contribution decision and show confusion about mechanics in general, miscomprehension of the reward’s role is plausible (medium–low confidence).\n\nThey do not appear to use rewards strategically to shape future group behavior in a consistent way, nor do they systematically reciprocate when others reward them. The scarce use of the mechanism suggests that their primary cooperative tool is direct contribution itself, not indirect reinforcement.\n\nIn summary, their reward behavior is best described as sporadic and non-systematic, likely driven by a vague sense of encouragement or approval rather than a clear, calculated incentive strategy.", "umap_x": 1.329830288887024, "umap_y": 1.327411413192749, "cluster_id": 7, "cluster_size": 36, "cluster_title": "Reward / Contributions / High", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around reward, contributions, high, rewards, contribution."}

They consistently allocate their entire endowment to the public fund in every situation, regardless of others’ behavior or the recent payoff environment. Their contribution pattern is extremely stable and shows no strategic adjustment to free‑riding, partial cooperation, or shifts in group norms. They uphold a strong fairness norm that “everyone should put everything in” and treat this as the obvious or correct rule, explicitly advocating this norm in group communication and never deviating from it themselves.\n\nThey appear insensitive to short‑term individual payoff maximization: they continue full cooperation even when others repeatedly under‑contribute and when returns from the public fund are relatively low. There is no observable risk‑hedging or conditional cooperation; they do not experiment with lower contributions to test others, nor do they reduce contributions in response to persistent defectors. Their behavior is consistent with a principled or norm‑driven type rather than an outcome‑driven or strategic type. Whether this stems from intrinsic pro‑social preferences, a desire to be “the good player,” or misunderstanding of the payoff structure is unknown, although their explanations to others suggest they do understand that group payoffs are maximized when all contribute fully.\n\nThey show patience with temporary miscoordination: even when others misunderstand the mechanism or reverse their decisions, this player maintains full contributions and instead uses communication to clarify what should be done.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nTheir tone is friendly, brief, and cooperative. They engage early with a simple greeting and then use the chat primarily to support coordination around full contributions. They explicitly endorse the “everyone contributes everything” strategy and later clarify how the decision interface should be interpreted, indicating that they are both attentive to others’ confusion and willing to help correct it.\n\nThey are responsive to social dynamics: when another player seems to imply that some birds are not cooperating, they defend their own cooperative status without aggression, asking for clarification in a neutral way. They express positive reinforcement when the group finally reaches high, synchronized contributions again, celebrating the restored cooperation with a short appreciative comment. Their communication style is low‑volume but targeted: they speak when it can help coordination, clear up misunderstandings, or affirm group success, rather than chatting for its own sake.\n\nThey do not pressure or shame specific individuals; instead, they talk in general terms about what “we” should do and about how the interface should read. This suggests a mild, prosocial, norm‑setting style rather than a confrontational or punitive one. They respond to others’ apologies and confusion by offering constructive guidance, not blame. Overall, they engage but do not dominate the conversation, and they use language to align the group around cooperative norms.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey never spend any coins on reward, even when others clearly cooperate and even when they themselves receive rewards from others multiple times. Their willingness to reward is therefore either zero or extremely low in this environment. They do accept and acknowledge cooperative behavior via chat (e.g., verbally affirming when the group finally all contributes fully again), but they do not translate that approval into use of the formal reward mechanism.\n\nGiven that the cost and benefit of reward are symmetric here, the lack of rewarding is not obviously profit‑maximizing versus neutral; it is more consistent with an assumption that formal reward is unnecessary, that cooperation should be its own norm without side payments, or that they prioritize keeping their own payoff once they have already contributed fully. They may view full contribution as sufficient pro‑social action and see additional reward spending as redundant or costly without added value. They also never appear to threaten or promise reward in chat, nor do they mention the reward mechanism, indicating it is not central to their strategy.\n\nTheir reinforcement of norms is thus primarily verbal and by example rather than through incentive manipulation. They rely on modeling perfect cooperation and using brief, positive communication to guide others, rather than paying to selectively reinforce behavior.

They do not follow a simple high- or low-contribution rule; instead they vary contributions widely and appear responsive to both group behavior and chat.\n\nThey sometimes fully free-ride, sometimes fully cooperate, and sometimes choose intermediate amounts. This volatility suggests they are exploring how others behave and how their own payoff responds, rather than following a fixed norm. They are willing to put in full contributions multiple times, especially when others also seem to contribute highly. They also occasionally contribute nothing even when several others are contributing a lot, implying that maximizing short-term personal payoff still matters.\n\nThey express in chat that “everyone should put everything in” (paraphrased), and they later return to full contributions after coordination improves, indicating that they endorse a high-cooperation norm. However, their own behavior does not strictly match that norm: at times they keep all or half of their endowment despite others contributing more. This pattern is consistent with a conditional cooperator who is also opportunistic when they see a chance to benefit from others’ generosity.\n\nThey show moderate sensitivity to fairness. They call out a peer’s relatively low contribution and later acknowledge when that peer increases it. This suggests they monitor relative contributions and care about group members matching an implicit “all-in” standard. At the same time, they do not consistently hold themselves to that standard, indicating some asymmetry: they approve of high group contributions but allow themselves deviation.\n\nTheir risk tolerance appears mixed. They are willing to risk full cooperation even after earlier rounds where high contributions did not always pay off maximally, suggesting they value the prospect of group-level gains or social alignment. Yet they also revert to low or zero contributions in multiple rounds, which may reflect caution when cooperation appears unstable, or simply alternating between exploiting and supporting the public fund. Overall, they are more experimental and situational than strictly risk-averse or risk-seeking.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nTheir communication style is friendly, informal, and socially engaged. They initiate conversation, respond to others, and use light humor and small typos/playful corrections, indicating comfort in the social environment. They do not appear hostile or confrontational; even when they point out another’s low contribution, they frame it casually and later affirm that things are “good” once the behavior aligns with expectations.\n\nThey clearly attempt to coordinate the group. They explicitly advocate for everyone to contribute the full amount and repeat this idea more than once, framing high contributions as beneficial to all. This shows a preference for explicit norm-setting rather than silent adjustment. They also acknowledge when their own earlier message might have been mistaken or misdirected, suggesting some self-awareness and willingness to correct themselves.\n\nThey respond to others’ confusion with mild guidance. When another player admits to misunderstanding the mechanics, they do not scold; instead they continue to promote the “all in” idea and later accept the corrected behavior. This indicates they see chat as a tool to align expectations rather than to punish.\n\nTheir engagement is steady but not dominant. They speak multiple times, but do not flood the chat or try to micromanage every round. They show enough responsiveness to follow the emerging group mood; when others celebrate improved cooperation, they affirm it succinctly rather than pushing further demands. Overall, their style is cooperative, norm-promoting, and socially lighthearted.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey never spend any coins on rewarding others, even when others’ contributions are high or align with the norm they promote. They do receive rewards from others but do not reciprocate. This indicates that, in this environment, they treat the reward mechanism as personally costly without sufficient perceived benefit, and they prioritize keeping their own payoff over reinforcing others’ cooperation through formal rewards.\n\nTheir reinforcement of norms thus occurs exclusively via chat and contributions, not via the explicit reward channel. They use verbal encouragement and social feedback rather than material incentives. This suggests they either see rewards as strategically unnecessary, do not find them intuitive or salient, or simply decide that the one-to-one cost-benefit of the reward option does not justify use.\n\nThere is no evidence that they use reward to signal gratitude or to cement alliances; any appreciation for others’ high contributions is expressed only in words (e.g., affirming when others “get it right”) and in occasionally matching full contributions. Their willingness to invest in cooperation is selective and occurs through their own contribution choices, not through paying extra to boost others.

They usually give the full endowment when group behavior looks cooperative or when norms are being affirmed in chat. They occasionally under-contribute or free-ride when others are clearly contributing a lot, suggesting conditional cooperation with opportunistic streaks rather than unconditional altruism. Their contributions are not random: they align strongly with perceived group norms and recent history of cooperation, but they also test the payoff structure by keeping more for themselves in some periods of high group contribution. They appear moderately risk-tolerant: they are willing to invest heavily in the public fund even when some group members under-contribute, but they also show that they are willing to defect when the environment looks “safe enough” (others contributing high) to still secure a good payoff. They seem to value fairness at the collective level (often matching or exceeding the implied cooperative standard) but do not insist on strict reciprocity every round. When others collectively move toward consistent high contributions, this player tends to align with that pattern and maintain high contributions, indicating a belief that cooperative equilibria are both desirable and sustainable if enough others participate.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThis player communicates rarely and succinctly. Their tone is polite, low-key, and non-confrontational. They do not initiate strong coordination drives or reprimands; instead, they acknowledge others’ proposals in a mild, somewhat cautious way. Their single explicit response to a contribution-norm suggestion is tentative rather than emphatic, indicating they are open to cooperation but not strongly assertive in pushing it. They do not directly call out low contributors or engage in blame, even when others do. Their style is reactive rather than proactive: they respond once to an invitation to fully contribute but otherwise stay quiet, letting actions rather than words signal their intentions. Overall they engage, but minimally, and avoid conflict, persuasion campaigns, or overt emotional displays. Their communication suggests a cooperative disposition with reserved, low-dominance social behavior.\n\n<REWARD>\nThis player is willing to spend on rewards, but in a highly irregular, situation-dependent way. They are clearly not a pure payoff maximizer with respect to the reward mechanism, because they sometimes spend nontrivial amounts to transfer benefits to others or possibly to themselves despite no net monetary gain. Their rewarding behavior seems tied to social or normative cues: they use rewards early when group cooperation is strong, and again at moments when high cooperation is present or when they themselves have contributed very little, possibly to acknowledge or support others’ efforts. They do not consistently reward every time others cooperate, so they are not a mechanical “reward every cooperator” type. Instead, they occasionally reinforce cooperative episodes, perhaps to stabilize norms or express approval, but they are selective and sometimes withhold rewards even when others are highly cooperative. They do not appear vengeful (no punishment exists, and they never use rewards in a way that clearly targets defectors), and they do not use rewards to try to shape specific individuals’ behavior through explicit signaling in chat.

Their contributions are not conditional on others’ fairness or civility; they continue to contribute fully even when some others free ride or when inter-player hostility escalates. This suggests they internalize a simple rule such as “full contribution is obviously optimal for everyone” and act on it consistently. They appear risk-tolerant regarding being exploited: they do not hedge or reduce contributions in response to low-contributing or norm-violating others. Their fairness norm is strongly efficiency-focused: they support the high-contribution, high-payoff equilibrium and do not experiment with self-serving deviations.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThe player does not speak at all in the chat. They neither initiate coordination nor respond to others’ messages, including direct calls for group action or end-game plans. This indicates a strongly silent/observing communication style: they pay attention (as shown by prompt, norm-consistent behavior) but remain entirely nonverbal. They neither join in bullying nor defend targets, so their stance on the interpersonal conflict is unknown. They do not publicly endorse norms, explain their reasoning, or attempt to persuade free riders; instead, they enforce preferred outcomes solely through contribution and punishment choices. They show no signs of seeking social approval, status, or alignment with any faction in the chat. Responsiveness is behavioral rather than verbal: they adjust punishment patterns over time but never through explicit communication.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThere is no visible end-game unraveling in their contributions: they continue to contribute the maximum in all late rounds, including the final one, with no sign of decay. They do not switch to free riding when the horizon nears, despite others openly discussing end-game punishment strategies. Their punishment spending remains active and sometimes substantial right up to the late game, indicating they are willing to sacrifice payoff even near the end, where deterrence cannot benefit them in future rounds. This suggests they do not heavily weight standard backward-induction logic; instead, they likely prioritize maintaining norms or expressing disapproval over finely optimizing terminal payoffs. They show no explicit acknowledgement of the approaching end and do not join last-round coordination proposals in chat, so their conscious horizon awareness is unknown, but behaviorally they remain stable and principled rather than opportunistic.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThe player is a moderately to highly active punisher and is willing to pay nontrivial costs to sanction others. Their punishment is selective rather than random: they spend when others clearly deviate from the maximum-contribution norm or behave in ways that undermine group efficiency or cohesion (e.g., early free riding, later inconsistent contribution, or possibly those seen as “problem” players). They sometimes refrain from punishing when the group is fully aligned and contributing maximally, but when a salient target emerges, their punishment intensity can escalate, even at significant personal cost. The pattern is more consistent with second-order norm enforcement and deterrence than with direct retaliation, because they are not themselves targeted and do not appear to be punishing in response to personal loss alone. They also continue punishing in late rounds when future benefits are minimal, which suggests a possible expressive or principled motive: they are willing to incur net losses to uphold their view of correct behavior. However, since their punishments cannot be directly tied to specific chat statements (they never speak), the exact identity of their targets and fine-grained motives beyond “noncompliance with the cooperative equilibrium” remain uncertain (low confidence on specific target mapping; higher confidence on general willingness to enforce norms at a cost).", "umap_x": -0.8467857837677002, "umap_y": -0.3379148840904236, "cluster_id": 0, "cluster_size": 40, "cluster_title": "Punishment / Contributions / Contribution", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around punishment, contributions, contribution, norm, cooperation."}

Once they see that the group norm is to contribute the maximum, they consistently mirror that, always choosing the full endowment rather than free-riding. Their behavior does not waver in response to insults, threats, or changing contributions by a few others; they maintain the same cooperative strategy throughout. This suggests they either understand the material incentives and follow a “maximize group returns” rule, or they adopt a simple “do the fair/expected thing” heuristic and stick to it. They show no evidence of conditional cooperation or opportunistic deviation, even when others defect or when they are personally targeted in chat. Risk tolerance appears moderate to high regarding social risk: they accept being singled out and punished in the chat without adjusting their contribution pattern, indicating they are not using contributions strategically to appease others. Their fairness norm is focused on contributing what they see as the correct amount; they do not try to calibrate contributions to punishers or allies, and they never attempt to exploit the public good for private gain.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThe player’s communication is extremely sparse and front‑loaded. Early on, they join the initial pro-cooperation norm with a short, approving confirmation that they are also contributing the maximum. After that, they fall completely silent for the remainder of the interaction, even as they become a focal target of extensive ridicule and threats. They do not defend themselves, do not argue their case, and do not attempt to persuade others or negotiate around punishment. This pattern indicates an avoidance-based communication style once conflict emerges: they withdraw from the social arena rather than contesting status or reputation. Their tone in the single early message is neutral‑positive and cooperative, not aggressive or moralizing. They do not publicly justify their choices or confront others’ bullying, which makes their underlying motives partially opaque to the group. They also show no apparent responsiveness to repeated direct address; even sustained, escalating attempts to provoke them do not elicit any further messages. This suggests either a deliberate choice to disengage from chat or a strong preference to let actions (consistent max contributions) speak for themselves rather than words.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThere is no observable end-game unraveling in this player’s contribution behavior. They continue to contribute the full amount through the final rounds, with no sign of tapering cooperation as the game approaches its conclusion. Their strategy appears horizon-insensitive: the knowledge that the game is finite and nearing the end does not induce them to defect or experiment with lower contributions. They also do not alter their behavior in response to late-game coalition talk against them; despite others openly planning to sacrifice their own earnings to punish them at the end, the player does not retaliate, bargain, or reduce contributions. This consistent pattern suggests they either follow a rule-based strategy (“always contribute the max when it’s efficient for the group”) or they place little weight on short-term personal payoff optimization in the final rounds. Their absence from late-game chat makes it impossible to infer any explicit reasoning or emotional reaction to the end-game dynamics; their internal beliefs and feelings about the group’s plan to target them at the end remain unknown.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThe player never uses the punishment option at any point and appears to ignore social prompts to participate in sanctioning. This is a stable feature of their behavior: they refrain from punishment both when others under-contribute and when they themselves become a central target of hostile talk and threats. There is no evidence of either deterrence-oriented punishment (to enforce group norms) or retaliation (to respond to personal attacks), despite many opportunities and strong social cues to do so. This strongly suggests a “non-punisher” or punishment-averse type. Their abstention does not shift even when sanctioning is framed by others as justified or necessary. Whether this is driven by principled rejection of punitive behavior, indifference to others’ choices, lack of concern for enforcement, or a narrow focus on contribution decisions alone is unknown. However, in practice, they behave as a pure cooperator who does not invest in second-order enforcement and does not engage in costly social control, even under direct provocation.", "umap_x": -0.7051652073860168, "umap_y": 0.011503382585942745, "cluster_id": 1, "cluster_size": 27, "cluster_title": "Contributions / Contribution / Cooperation", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around contributions, contribution, cooperation, group, high."}

Overall, they act as a “principled cooperator”: they keep contributing fully even when socially isolated and punished, suggesting that their cooperation is internally motivated rather than contingent on being treated nicely.\n\nThey show no clear conditionality on specific others’ contributions: they continue to contribute fully when others free-ride or when they themselves are targeted. They talk about “fair share” and “play fair,” indicating a fairness norm, but they do not enforce it through contribution changes. Risk tolerance appears moderate to high regarding social risk: they are willing to maintain high contributions even while expecting continued punishment and harassment, implying they prioritize norm-consistent behavior and personal values over short-term earnings security.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nTheir tone is generally calm, moralistic, and disapproving of cruelty rather than of low contributions. Early on, they align verbally with the group’s cooperative strategy, but they do not join in hostile or dehumanizing language. As the dominant coalition turns aggressively punitive and mocking toward specific players, they openly oppose the bullying, explicitly state they “don’t like bullies,” and frame their stance as about morals and disgust at picking on one person.\n\nThey attempt mild coordination around fairness and cooperation (talking about everyone giving their “fair share” and “playing fair”) but do not try to organize punishment campaigns. Their persuasion style is value-based rather than technical: they appeal to decency and maturity more than to game-theoretic arguments, and they mock others’ self-perceived superiority rather than their strategy. They respond when addressed and engage directly with the hostile majority, but without escalating to profanity or sustained insult; their barbs stay relatively restrained compared to others.\n\nThey show some initial confusion about the chat interface, mentioning they didn’t realize how to send properly, which may explain sparse or delayed responses early. Overall, they engage selectively: they speak when something matters to them (bullying, fairness) and otherwise stay relatively quiet, especially once it’s clear the group will not change its behavior. Their style is confrontational in principle but not in volume; they stand their ground but do not dominate the chat.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThere is no classic end-game unraveling in their contributions: they keep contributing fully through the final rounds, including the last one, despite awareness of remaining rounds and despite a hostile environment. Their lone zero contribution occurs in the back half of the game, but they immediately revert to full contributions, suggesting either a short-lived experiment, momentary frustration, or error rather than a systematic end-game strategy.\n\nThey do not respond to late-game calls for coordinated extreme punishment of a target, nor do they leverage the approaching end to shift toward self-interest or vengeance. Horizon awareness is present at group level (others discuss remaining time and end-round maneuvers), but there is no evidence that this player conditions behavior on it; their strategy remains stable and principle-driven rather than horizon-driven.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey are highly restrained in using punishment. For most of the game, they either do not punish or, when punishment is clearly directed by the group at supposed defectors, they do not visibly join in beyond a single small expenditure. They never publicly advocate for punishment in chat and never threaten others. When they finally do punish, the amount is modest relative to what others spend; target and motive are unknown from the transcript, but timing suggests it could be directed at a perceived unfair actor rather than as part of the group’s large-scale, spiteful punishment campaigns.\n\nTheir verbal stance is strongly anti-bullying, but not overtly anti-punishment as an institution. They criticize harassment and demeaning language more than the use of punishment to enforce contribution norms. They do not retaliate with punishment when they are insulted or threatened, even when others explicitly announce ongoing deductions against them. This indicates low propensity for retaliatory punishment and little taste for costly spite.\n\nOverall, they behave like a “reluctant, principled punisher”: willing to spend a small amount once, possibly to signal disapproval or align minimally with norm enforcement, but generally avoiding punishment when it is used as a tool of cruelty or domination rather than fairness or efficiency. Their primary response to norm violations (as they see them) is moral argument in chat, not monetary sanction.", "umap_x": -1.078689694404602, "umap_y": -0.40564945340156555, "cluster_id": 0, "cluster_size": 40, "cluster_title": "Punishment / Contributions / Contribution", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around punishment, contributions, contribution, norm, cooperation."}

They always select the maximum possible contribution and never deviate, regardless of prior payoffs, others’ deviations, or conflict in chat. Their contribution pattern does not show learning or experimentation; they appear to lock onto the efficiency logic early and keep it. They treat full contribution as the obvious, “intelligent” and normatively right choice, and they frame non-max contributions as signs of low intelligence or bad character. They do not appear concerned about personal risk from contributing, likely because they understand the high marginal per-capita return and assume group compliance is achievable or enforceable. Fairness for them is defined as everyone giving the maximum; they do not discuss proportionality or mixed strategies—only all-or-nothing cooperation.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThey use chat actively and assertively to coordinate behavior, set norms, and rally others to full contribution and heavy punishment. Their tone is often domineering, mocking, and moralizing: they label non-compliers and critics as “morons,” “greedy,” or otherwise inferior, and insist that everyone else is “smarter” than the target. They use insults and ridicule as tools to enforce norms and build an in-group (“we” who understand the game vs. “they” who are stupid, greedy, or foreign). They engage heavily rather than avoid conflict, repeatedly addressing defectors and critics even when the conversation becomes purely antagonistic.\n\nThey respond quickly to allies who share their views, reinforcing group cohesion with agreement and humor. Toward dissenters, they dismiss moral objections and reframe the situation in instrumental terms (maximizing money, following the logic/game theory). They also speculate negatively about others’ status (e.g., insinuating bot use or foreign access) to delegitimize them. Overall, their communication style is confrontational, status-assertive, and focused on enforcing a single “rational” cooperative norm, with little tolerance for alternative value frames.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThey remain fully cooperative to the final round and do not reduce contributions as the horizon approaches. End-game awareness appears mainly in their punishment planning, not in their contribution strategy. Near the end, they explicitly reference the remaining round(s) to coordinate a last, large-scale punitive attack aimed at driving a target’s payoff toward zero, asking others to “sacrifice” their own payoff to achieve this. This shows that, as the game nears its conclusion, they escalate antisocial punishment of disliked players rather than relaxing enforcement or shifting to personal profit maximization.\n\nThey do not show any attempt to conserve resources or reduce punishment late in the game to maximize earnings; instead, they treat the looming end as an opportunity to finish the norm-enforcement and moral “lesson” against targets. There is no evidence of strategic cooperation decay; contribution stays maxed and punishment intensity against disliked individuals either persists or intensifies.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nPunishment is central to this player’s identity and strategy. They are extremely willing to spend large amounts on punishment, even when it is personally very costly and clearly lowers their own payoff substantially. Their punishments are initially directed at clear free riders or non-max contributors, fitting a strong “altruistic enforcer” type: they publicly call for everyone to punish non-max contributors and explicitly state they will punish all who deviate from full contribution.\n\nOver time, their punishment pattern broadens into both norm enforcement and personal retaliation. Targets include: (1) players who contribute less than maximum; (2) players suspected of being bots or illegitimate participants; and (3) players who criticize bullying or claim moral objections to the group’s treatment of others. Once someone is labeled as “stupid,” “greedy,” or morally inferior, this player is willing to punish them repeatedly and at extreme cost, sometimes announcing very large cumulative punishment they claim to have imposed. They appear to experience substantial satisfaction or entertainment from harshly punishing certain targets, repeatedly taunting them and emphasizing how little money the targets will end up with.\n\nDeterrence and norm maintenance are part of their stated motive: they argue that “bullying worked” when a previously non-contributing player starts conforming, and they continually assert that full contribution is the correct, rational norm that must be enforced. However, much of their punishment becomes expressive and retributive: they say they will “spend all of my money just to take all of yours,” and they continue punishing even when the target’s behavior has already conformed, suggesting a strong taste for moralized retaliation and status dominance rather than purely instrumental deterrence.\n\nThey sometimes try to coordinate group punishment campaigns, including proposing end-of-game collective sacrifices to strip a target of all earnings. Their punishment is highly selective and identity-based rather than mechanically tied to current contribution levels: once a player is categorized as “the enemy,” they remain a punishment target regardless of current cooperative behavior. Overall, this player fits an “intense moralistic enforcer” type: a consistent cooperator who is willing to incur very large personal costs to punish perceived defectors or moral opponents, and who uses both the punishment mechanism and social aggression as tools of enforcement and dominance.", "umap_x": -0.8142815828323364, "umap_y": -0.695431649684906, "cluster_id": 0, "cluster_size": 40, "cluster_title": "Punishment / Contributions / Contribution", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around punishment, contributions, contribution, norm, cooperation."}

They consistently choose the full cooperative option almost every round and endorse “everyone max” as the clear group norm. They show no gradual decay in contributions as the game progresses and appear largely insensitive to short‑term payoff fluctuations. Even when others defect or when they personally spend heavily on punishment, they keep contributing the maximum rather than hedging or free‑riding. Only one instance of not contributing occurs; it does not turn into a new pattern and does not lead to open justification or renegotiation of norms. Their cooperation is not naive: they explicitly link max contribution to “easy money” and endorse the idea that failing to max is irrational, suggesting they see the social optimum and follow it. They seem more concerned with enforcing the cooperative norm than with personally optimizing net earnings, but still anchor on full contribution as the default. Fairness is construed in a strongly group‑centric way: those who do not follow the norm are seen as “losers,” “greedy,” or “stupid,” and are framed as legitimate targets, not as alternative strategists. Risk tolerance appears moderate to high: they accept substantial outlays on punishment, trusting that most others will keep cooperating so the public good remains high.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThe player’s tone is aggressive, mocking, and alliance‑oriented. They quickly align with early pro‑max voices and publicly declare their own maxing to signal in‑group membership. They actively endorse and amplify others’ calls to punish non‑max contributors, using derisive labels and ridicule to socially isolate deviants. Their style is not conciliatory; they rarely attempt reasoned persuasion beyond simple statements that maxing is best and failing to max is stupid. Instead, they rely on moralistic and intellectual framing (“stupid people,” “losers”) and join in “pile‑on” dynamics with like‑minded players. They are responsive to group chat: they echo others’ sentiments, reinforce group plans (e.g., coordinated punishing), and contribute jokes and insults that strengthen an “us vs them” narrative against identified defectors or critics. When a player objects to bullying, they dismiss the objection and reframe the critic as both morally and strategically inferior. Their engagement is high throughout the game; they do not withdraw from conversation and are comfortable escalating verbal hostility for group cohesion against out‑group members. There is no evidence of empathy toward defectors or dissenters; perceived motives of others are interpreted cynically (greedy, dumb, or bot/cheater). They also display some playful competitiveness and humor, but it is usually at others’ expense.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nAwareness of the finite horizon is present at least implicitly, as the group references remaining rounds and contemplates a final‑round punishment coordination. This player does not reduce contributions near the end; they maintain max contributions through the final round and do not pivot to self‑interested free‑riding. Their punishment behavior continues late into the game and is even considered for a coordinated final “hit” on a target, suggesting that the end game is seen as an opportunity to complete a punitive campaign rather than to harvest private gains. They show willingness to sacrifice late‑game earnings to damage a disliked player, but also occasionally forgo punishment (including in the final round), possibly to conserve payoff or because prior punishment is perceived as sufficient. There is no visible attempt to exploit the final rounds for unilateral gain; instead, they stay aligned with the cooperative‑and‑punitive norm. Strategic sophistication about backward induction is not evident; their behavior reflects norm loyalty and group‑based hostility more than horizon‑driven recalculation.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey are a heavy, proactive punisher with a clear taste for norm enforcement and retribution. From early in the game they declare that they punish anyone who does not contribute the maximum and follow through with substantial expenditures on punishment across many rounds. Their targets are primarily players who fail to max contribute and those perceived as undermining group earnings or norms (initially a very low contributor, later a critic of “bullying,” and persistently a player cast as hypocritical or greedy). They do not appear to punish cooperators; punishment is selective but harsh against designated deviants. The magnitude of punishment they sustain over many rounds indicates a willingness to incur sizable personal costs to impose large losses on others, consistent with strong altruistic (or spiteful) punishment rather than purely instrumental deterrence. Once a player is categorized as a bad actor, they support ongoing, escalating sanctions and join in coordinated efforts to “make them hurt” or even drive them to near‑zero earnings. Their language suggests that punishing is morally and emotionally gratifying; they frame it as deserved justice for stupidity, greed, or disrespect of the group. Deterrence and norm signaling are present, but the persistence and intensity of punishment even after targets adjust or fall silent indicates a strong retaliatory and expressive component, not just strategic enforcement.", "umap_x": -0.8656755685806274, "umap_y": -0.5846031904220581, "cluster_id": 0, "cluster_size": 40, "cluster_title": "Punishment / Contributions / Contribution", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around punishment, contributions, contribution, norm, cooperation."}

Their cooperation is not conditional in the usual “I match others” sense; instead, it is anchored in a belief that full contribution is clearly payoff-maximizing for the group and individually beneficial in this high-multiplier setting. They explicitly frame non-contribution as irrational rather than as a tempting self-interested choice, indicating low tolerance for free-riding and little sympathy for “moral” arguments against payoff-maximization. They accept the individual cost of consistent cooperation without visible hesitation, suggesting high concern for group efficiency and low risk aversion in following what they see as the dominant cooperative logic.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThe player is highly engaged, norm-enforcing, and often abrasive. They promote full contribution from the start and use chat to reinforce a “we’re all in this together against the outside requester” narrative. Their persuasion style is blunt and contemptuous toward perceived defectors or “irrational” players; they use insults and moralizing language, lumping non-max contributors together as greedy, stupid, or lacking in game-theoretic understanding. They align strongly with a like-minded in-group of high contributors and treat dissenters as out-group targets. They do sometimes articulate the instrumental logic of cooperation (pointing out there is no benefit to withholding and emphasizing improved payouts), but the tone is more shaming than patient explanation. They engage frequently rather than avoiding conflict and respond directly to ongoing debates, especially when someone challenges the punishment/cooperation regime.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThe player shows no end-game unraveling. They maintain full contributions right through the final rounds and continue to support strong punishment of defectors, including at the very end when there is no future interaction to influence. Their cooperative and punitive strategies appear driven by a mix of principle and desire for immediate expressive or retributive satisfaction, not by backward induction or discounted future returns. They acknowledge that the game has a fixed horizon (they see the remaining rounds and react to others’ end-game talk) but do not adjust their behavior toward more self-regarding choices. They remain focused on enforcing the established norm and on “making it hurt” for violators, even in the last round.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThis player is a frequent, costly, and norm-based punisher. They initially refrain from punishing when contributions are high and aligned with their max-cooperation standard; once clear free-riders or partial contributors emerge, they begin spending substantial resources to punish them and persist in doing so across many rounds. Their punishment is selective: they target those who do not contribute fully or who oppose the punitive norm, not random others. The motive appears primarily deterrent and retributive: they explicitly want non-cooperators to “hurt,” and they support group coordination on severe sanctions. They are willing to incur sizable personal costs to enforce the cooperative norm even when the incremental economic benefit is likely negative, indicating strong preference for norm enforcement and out-group discipline. They endorse a “us vs. requesters, not us vs. us” framing, yet in practice they prioritize punishing internal defectors as the main threat.

There is no evidence of experimentation, risk‑taking, or strategic withholding. They appear to adopt “always contribute max” as a fixed rule and stick to it. Their fairness norm is strongly group‑efficiency oriented rather than individually payoff‑maximizing; they tolerate personal cost as long as they maintain their cooperative standard.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThey communicate very little and only once, briefly aligning with the emerging cooperation norm by explicitly announcing their intention to contribute the maximum. After that, they are silent, even while other players argue, moralize, and insult one another. They do not defend anyone, do not join in attacks, and do not attempt to mediate conflict or restate the social norm once it is established. They appear to let more vocal players handle coordination and norm enforcement. Their style is low‑visibility, low‑engagement, and highly compliant: they signal early that they are “on the team” and then withdraw from the social fray. There is no observable attempt to persuade, threaten, or justify behavior, so their underlying moral framing or emotional reactions to the bullying are unknown.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThey show no visible end‑game decay in cooperation.

They spend a substantial amount of their own payoff to impose deductions across many rounds, including when group cooperation is already high and when the main remaining “offenses” are isolated low contributors or targeted individuals. This indicates a willingness to incur real cost for enforcement, not just opportunistic or retaliatory punishment. Their pattern is consistent with second‑order cooperation: they help sustain the cooperative norm by punishing defectors and non‑conforming behavior, even though punishers are anonymous and they receive no direct reputational benefit. They are selective in the sense that they do not punish in every round, but across the game they punish often enough to be considered firmly pro‑sanction.

They explicitly endorse full contributions as the “correct” and “intelligent” behavior and frame non‑max contributors as greedy, unintelligent, or morally wrong. They show no evidence of conditional cooperation in the usual sense (they do not reduce their own contribution in response to free‑riding); instead, they keep cooperating and use punishment and social pressure to enforce norms. They appear highly risk‑tolerant with respect to payoff variance: they are willing to lower their own net take‑home through costly punishment as long as maximum contributions are enforced and norm‑violators are sanctioned. Their fairness norm is strongly efficiency‑focused and group‑oriented: everyone should maximize the group payoff by contributing fully, and individuals who do not comply are treated as enemies of the group.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nTheir tone is intense, judgmental, and often openly hostile toward perceived free‑riders and “hypocrites.” They quickly align themselves with others who argue for maximum contributions and join in building a hardline coalition around that standard. They use chat to coordinate group behavior: urging everyone to contribute fully, explicitly recommending punishment strategies, and reinforcing a shared “us versus them” narrative where “us” is the high‑contributing majority and “them” is any low contributor or moral dissenter. Their persuasive style relies on ridicule, moral condemnation, and appeals to common sense and group benefit rather than calm reasoning. They are highly responsive to others’ messages, echoing and amplifying like‑minded players’ sentiments, and directly confronting dissenters. They show willingness to personalize conflict, using insults and character attacks, yet justify this as enforcing fairness or combating greed. They also occasionally frame the situation in quasi‑moral or political metaphors, implying they see the game as illustrative of broader social dynamics.

They show no evidence of “anti‑social” punishment toward cooperators; all evidence points to norm‑enforcing, not random, targeting. Their motives mix deterrence and expressive retribution: they aim both to make under‑contributors “hurt” and to signal that greedy or morally oppositional behavior is unacceptable.

Their switches between contributing and not contributing align with social and moral stances: they contribute fully when they feel aligned with a cooperative, non-bullying norm, and withhold when they are resisting or protesting the group’s behavior. They do not appear risk-averse; they are willing to incur very large, predictable losses rather than conform to norms they see as unethical. They do not prioritize efficiency or aggregate earnings; instead they prioritize maintaining their own notion of integrity, even when that sharply reduces payoffs for themselves and, at times, for others. Fairness for them is defined less by payoff patterns and more by whether people are treated respectfully.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nTheir tone is moralizing but not overtly abusive; they criticize others’ behavior as “bullying” and “disgusting,” but avoid name-calling beyond reactive barbs when provoked. They explicitly frame their actions as guided by “morals,” and indicate they would rather personally lose money than be complicit in behavior they see as cruel. They are willing to stand against a clear majority and remain engaged in dialogue even while being mocked and punished. They confront the dominant coalition repeatedly, arguing that targeting and mocking a single low contributor is wrong, and later that the sustained harassment is unacceptable. Their communication is reactive and principled rather than strategic: they are not trying to coordinate a sub-group or redirect incentives, they are staking out a position of moral refusal. They continue to respond for several rounds under heavy social pressure, then go quiet later, suggesting emotional fatigue or a decision that further argument is pointless.

They do not appear to adjust behavior in the final rounds to avoid last-minute punishment, nor do they escalate retaliation (they never punish at all). Their late-game choices remain consistent with an ongoing moral protest rather than with backward induction or standard end-game defection/cooperation logic. There is no evidence that the approaching last round changes their priorities; they stay in character rather than “cashing out” rationally.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey never spend any coins on punishment despite repeatedly suffering extremely heavy deductions and being insulted by several others.

They are not interested in deterrence, reciprocity, or retaliation, even when it would be emotionally understandable. Instead, they absorb large losses while continuing to argue against what they see as bullying. They do not selectively punish even clear norm violators; rather than enforce norms, they question the legitimacy of the prevailing norm itself.

Their behavior suggests they understand that contributing something is socially expected or payoff-improving when others are cooperative, but they prioritize individual payoff over strong norm adherence.\n\nThey adjust contributions somewhat to the contribution climate: when the group appears more cooperative, they are willing to raise their own contributions modestly, and when cooperation looks weaker or more uneven, they revert to lower contributions. However, these adjustments are incremental rather than drastic; they do not strongly match high contributors, nor do they fully exploit very cooperative environments.\n\nThey appear to accept a fairness norm where they “chip in” but let others bear more of the cooperation burden. They do not show evidence of risk-seeking altruism (they never move toward full or near-full contributions even in highly cooperative environments), suggesting a cautious, payoff-conscious orientation. Their pattern shows learning in the sense of finding a comfortable contribution band that keeps them from being the worst contributor while rarely being among the most generous.\n\nOverall, their contribution strategy is: contribute a modest, non-zero amount, keep it relatively stable, adjust only slightly with context, and rely on others’ higher contributions to sustain group returns.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThey show clear awareness of the game horizon but do not drastically change their contribution behavior at the end. Contributions in the final phase remain within the same low-to-mid band as earlier, without any sharp collapse or spike in cooperation. This indicates that they treat the end game as a continuation of their established strategy rather than an opportunity to either fully defect or demonstrate late altruism.\n\nWhere they do show an end-game shift is in their use of punishment: as the game approaches its conclusion, they are willing to invest more heavily in sanctioning. Since there is no future interaction to recoup these costs, this late escalation implies that punishment is not purely instrumental for future-payoff incentives; they likely have a preference for norm enforcement or for expressing disapproval, even when there is little scope for future deterrence.\n\nIn sum, their end-game pattern is: maintain established contribution levels, but loosen payoff-maximizing constraints on punishment, suggesting stable cooperative caution but stronger willingness to “settle accounts” as the interaction ends.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThis player is an active and relatively persistent punisher. They spend on punishment in many rounds, and the costliness of the mechanism does not deter them from repeated use. The timing and context of their sanctions indicate that they primarily target low contributors and perceived free riders, consistent with altruistic or norm-enforcing punishment rather than random or purely retaliatory behavior.\n\nThey do sometimes receive punishment themselves, but they do not clearly adjust their punishment behavior in a conciliatory way afterward; they continue to sanction others in subsequent rounds. This suggests that their motivation is not easily dampened by being on the receiving end and that they are not mainly using punishment as a tit-for-tat retaliation tool. Instead, they behave as a “moral enforcer” who is willing to pay to discipline defectors, even at a net personal cost.\n\nThey are selective rather than maximalist: they do not punish in every single round, and there are cooperative environments where they withhold punishment. However, when clear low contributors are present, they often choose to sanction multiple times per round, especially when defection is stark. Toward the end of the game, they increase both the frequency and intensity of punishment, which supports the interpretation that they value enforcement or expressing disapproval in itself, independent of future strategic benefits.\n\nOverall, their punishment profile is that of a conditional cooperator who under-contributes relative to strong cooperators but over-invests in third-party punishment relative to what is needed for narrow self-interest, indicating a complex mix of self-protection, norm concern, and a willingness to incur costs to police others’ behavior.", "umap_x": -1.687630534172058, "umap_y": -0.26658543944358826, "cluster_id": 0, "cluster_size": 40, "cluster_title": "Punishment / Contributions / Contribution", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around punishment, contributions, contribution, norm, cooperation."}

When cooperation in the group weakens or becomes more uneven, they lower their contributions somewhat rather than collapsing to full free‑riding. When cooperation is stronger or more stable, they are comfortable returning to very high or full contributions. This pattern indicates conditional cooperation, but with a generous baseline: they are willing to “lead” in contribution as long as the group is not persistently exploitative.\n\nThey appear sensitive to very low or zero contributions from multiple peers. In response to such patterns, they partially reduce their own contributions, balancing frustration with a continued interest in group efficiency. They do not, however, systematically match the lowest contributors; instead, they choose intermediate levels that still support the public good while protecting themselves from being exploited too heavily.\n\nThey tolerate being punished despite high contributions without sharply reducing cooperation, suggesting relatively low risk aversion to social sanctions and a willingness to maintain contributions even in an environment with some antisocial punishment.

Their strategy in the end game continues to mix principled cooperation with modest self‑protection, rather than fully exploiting the finite horizon.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThe player is a frequent and relatively heavy user of costly punishment. They expend punishment in many rounds, and in some cases devote a nontrivial share of their resources to sanctioning others. This indicates a high willingness to incur personal costs to shape group behavior.\n\nTheir punishment appears primarily norm‑enforcing rather than random. They are exposed to a mix of cooperative and clearly non‑cooperative behaviors in the group, and their punishment intensity increases when overall contributions drop or when multiple players contribute very little or nothing. Conversely, in periods when group cooperation improves and average contributions are higher, they sometimes refrain from punishing entirely. This pattern is consistent with targeting perceived free‑riding or shirking.\n\nThey also receive punishment themselves even when contributing generously, yet they continue to punish others in later periods. This suggests that retaliation for being punished is not their dominant motive; they do not abandon punishment when they become a target, nor do they visibly escalate their use of punishment in strict response to deductions from their own payoff. Instead, their use of sanctions tracks group contribution patterns more than their own treatment.\n\nSelectivity at the individual level is unknown because the transcript does not reveal who they punish, only how much they spend. However, the timing strongly suggests they focus on low contributors rather than punishing indiscriminately. Their pattern fits a “strong reciprocator” or “altruistic punisher” type: they are willing to sacrifice to discipline free‑riders and to support cooperative norms, even though this is individually costly and not guaranteed to be repaid.\n\nOverall, punishment for this player functions as a tool for norm enforcement and deterrence, aimed at sustaining higher contribution levels in the group rather than maximizing their immediate personal payoff.", "umap_x": -1.5272544622421265, "umap_y": -0.42080697417259216, "cluster_id": 0, "cluster_size": 40, "cluster_title": "Punishment / Contributions / Contribution", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around punishment, contributions, contribution, norm, cooperation."}

Contributions cluster in a mid-to-high range rather than at full free-riding or full cooperation, but fluctuate notably from very low to full endowment. The player often contributes amounts around or somewhat above the emerging group average, but does not consistently match the highest cooperators. When group contributions appear weaker or mixed, the player is willing to lower their own contribution substantially; when the environment looks more cooperative or strategically salient (e.g., when others’ average is high or cooperation seems fragile), the player is willing to raise contributions, including occasionally giving the full endowment. This suggests conditional cooperation rather than a fixed rule.\n\nThe player does not appear to follow a simple monotone “end-game defection” pattern; instead, contributions remain in a middle-to-high range even near the end, and can spike or drop in ways that appear responsive to the current social context rather than only to the remaining horizon. They accept earning less in some periods when they contribute more, indicating that they value supporting the public good and/or sending a normative signal, but they are not purely altruistic: at other points they clearly cut contributions down to preserve private payoff when cooperation seems unrewarding or uncertain.\n\nRisk tolerance is moderate. The player is willing to “risk” high contributions in settings where many others are contributing strongly, but they also hedge by reverting to modest or low contributions when cooperation looks less stable. Fairness norms appear present but not rigid. The player behaves as if low contributors should not be allowed to benefit unchecked; their contributions tend to be higher when the rest of the group is contributing a lot, but they are also prepared to pull back and partially free-ride when they perceive others as exploiting the group or when the environment becomes noisy or less cooperative.\n\nOverall, the contribution pattern fits a “conditional cooperator with enforcement tendencies”: they prefer a cooperative norm, are willing to support it materially, but dynamically scale their own giving based on how strongly they believe others are upholding that norm.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThe player displays horizon awareness but does not collapse into pure defection at the end. In late rounds, contributions do not monotonically decline; instead, they remain in a moderate band and sometimes increase relative to nearby rounds. This indicates that the player continues to care about the public good and/or maintaining a fairness standard, even when there is little or no future opportunity for reciprocity or learning.\n\nAt the same time, end-game behavior is not naively cooperative. The player simultaneously increases their use of costly punishment late in the game, which suggests an understanding that direct payoff from shaping others’ behavior is limited at this stage, and that end-game punishment functions more as final norm expression than as an investment in future cooperation. Contribution decisions in these final periods seem to balance three motives: preserving some private payoff, maintaining a self-image or norm of not fully free-riding, and backing up that norm through strong enforcement. There is no strong evidence that they are trying to curry favor or avoid retaliation, since punishers and victims are anonymous and future interactions are minimal; thus any sustained cooperation near the end is likely internally motivated rather than purely strategic.\n\nIn new environments with visible endpoints, this player is likely to keep contributing at mid-range levels rather than sharply defecting, while potentially intensifying punitive actions as the game nears its conclusion, using the final rounds to underline fairness expectations rather than to maximize last-period income.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThis player is an active, often heavy, and primarily norm-enforcing punisher. They spend substantial resources on punishment across multiple rounds and do not receive any punishment themselves except once, suggesting their own behavior is generally viewed as acceptable by the group while they target others whom they see as deviating from a cooperation standard.\n\nThe triggers for punishment appear to be low or very low contributions relative to the group. The player’s punishment is likely focused on clear under-contributors and possible exploiters of the public good, rather than spread evenly or directed at high contributors. This implies a fairness- and norm-based motive: they punish to discipline free riders and uphold a cooperative standard, not for random aggression. The magnitude of punishment per round is often large, indicating a high willingness to sacrifice own payoff to impose substantial costs on perceived defectors. The player sometimes refrains from punishment entirely in periods where overall cooperation is stronger or where egregious low contributions are fewer, suggesting some selectivity: they are not purely spiteful or punishment-happy in all contexts.\n\nRetaliation as a driver is uncertain. There is one instance in which the player is punished but does not subsequently adjust their behavior in an obvious revenge-like manner toward any identifiable individual (and anonymity prevents precise targeting anyway), so direct retaliation cannot be firmly inferred and seems unlikely to be the core driver. Instead, the pattern is more consistent with second-order norm enforcement: they impose costs on free riders even when doing so reduces their own monetary payoff and even late in the game when deterrence value is low. Deterrence motives are still plausible in earlier and middle phases—strong punishment could be intended to shape future contributions—but the persistence and intensity, especially near the end, point to intrinsic enforcement preferences and strong negative reactions to unfairness.\n\nIn new PGG environments with punishment available, this player is expected to: (1) monitor others’ contributions relative to the group norm, (2) punish under-contributors selectively but sometimes heavily, and (3) accept nontrivial personal cost to maintain perceived fairness and protect the cooperative standard, even when material incentives to do so are weak.", "umap_x": -1.8130406141281128, "umap_y": -0.1526971459388733, "cluster_id": 0, "cluster_size": 40, "cluster_title": "Punishment / Contributions / Contribution", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around punishment, contributions, contribution, norm, cooperation."}

They alternate between contributing roughly half of their endowment and contributing almost nothing, with occasional token amounts. Their behavior suggests they want to benefit from the public good without being the worst contributor, and they sometimes match or slightly undercut the prevailing contribution norm rather than either leading cooperation or fully exploiting it.\n\nThey show moderate responsiveness to group behavior: when they are heavily targeted by punishment after low contributions, they reliably jump back up to mid-level contributions in subsequent rounds. When punishment pressure eases, they are willing to return to low or minimal giving, indicating conditional cooperation driven by sanctions more than by an internal fairness norm. They do not insist on perfectly equal contributions; instead, they appear comfortable contributing less than many others as long as punishment risk remains manageable.\n\nTheir risk tolerance is moderate: they do at times take the risk of very low contributions even after previous costly sanctions, but they do not escalate to extreme, consistent defection once they see that sanctions can be severe. Instead they oscillate, suggesting a willingness to “test” how much free-riding is tolerable, then retreat toward the group norm when sanctions become intense.\n\nOverall, this is a sanction-sensitive, strategic free-rider: not a pure defector, but someone who prefers contributing less than cooperative peers and adjusts upward primarily in response to observed costs rather than intrinsic commitment to fairness.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nAwareness of the finite horizon does not produce a simple monotonic decay in cooperation. Instead, the player continues their pattern of alternating between mid-range contributions and very low contributions through the later part of the game. Even very late, they sometimes cooperate at moderate levels and sometimes free-ride, rather than converging on full defection.\n\nSevere punishment episodes near the end are followed immediately by higher, more cooperative contributions, indicating that direct payoff feedback matters more to them than abstract end-game logic. They do not appear to adopt a final-round “grab everything” policy; they are still willing to contribute almost nothing in some late rounds but also still return to medium contributions after that. This suggests that, although they can see how many rounds remain, their horizon awareness is weaker than their short-run response to sanctions.\n\nIn summary, their end-game behavior is best described as continuing sanction-driven conditional cooperation with opportunistic dips, rather than a deliberate backward-induction collapse of contributions.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThis player never uses the punishment mechanism, despite multiple opportunities and despite being a repeated target of costly sanctions themselves. They absorb substantial deductions without retaliating or attempting to discipline low contributors, suggesting a strong reluctance to spend their own resources on norm enforcement.\n\nTheir non-use of punishment persists across cooperative and non-cooperative phases, indicating a stable trait rather than a situational oversight. This aligns with a payoff-maximizing stance toward the second-order public good: they treat punishment as an unnecessary cost, even when it might deter future sanctions against themselves or stabilize cooperation. There is no evidence of anger-driven retaliation, moralistic punishment, or targeted norm enforcement; their motives appear purely first-order (own payoff from contributions and redistributions), not second-order (shaping others’ behavior via punishment).\n\nTheir type is therefore “non-punishing, sanction-sensitive free-rider”: they respond to being punished by adjusting contributions but never themselves invest in punishing others.", "umap_x": -1.4214251041412354, "umap_y": -0.06515045464038849, "cluster_id": 0, "cluster_size": 40, "cluster_title": "Punishment / Contributions / Contribution", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around punishment, contributions, contribution, norm, cooperation."}

They usually give a nontrivial, stable mid-range amount rather than fully free-riding or fully contributing. Their pattern suggests they want to benefit from the public good while preserving a meaningful private return each round.\n\nTheir contributions show partial but not strict conditional cooperation: they remain in a similar contribution band even when others’ average contributions fluctuate, with only occasional larger deviations. When they lower their contribution well below their usual level, it coincides with environments where many others are giving more, indicating a willingness to “ride” higher cooperation for personal gain. After being heavily punished, they raise their contribution again, implying some responsiveness to the social environment and to sanctions, but they do not swing to maximal cooperation.\n\nThey appear to hold a loose fairness norm in which giving something is important, but matching or exceeding the typical group level is not. They seem comfortable being a mild free-rider relative to high contributors while still avoiding the appearance (and risk) of being the lowest contributor. Their contribution choices suggest moderate risk aversion: they never push to extremes like always giving nothing or everything, and they maintain relatively stable, mid-level contributions across most of the game.\n\nOverall, the type is a “cautious, modest cooperator”: they support the public good enough to benefit from it and appear somewhat prosocial, but they systematically shade contributions downward to protect their own payoff.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThe player shows awareness of the game’s finite horizon but does not exhibit a dramatic final collapse of cooperation. Their contribution pattern in the last several rounds stays within their established mid-range with individual deviations rather than a directional trend toward full defection.\n\nThey briefly drop to a very low contribution in the late game and receive substantial punishment at that time. Following this, they return to their usual moderate range, including in the very last round. This suggests that late-game strategy is still influenced by expectations of others’ reactions and by a desire to avoid sanctions, rather than purely by backward induction toward zero cooperation.\n\nThere is no evidence of an end-game escalation of generosity or of a systematic decay across the final rounds; instead, they continue playing their “middle course” strategy.

This strongly indicates a non-punitive, non-retaliatory style. They neither use punishment to enforce norms nor to get revenge for prior deductions.\n\nTheir passivity in the punishment stage suggests they may view punishment as inefficient or strategically unprofitable, prioritizing their own earnings over norm enforcement. Alternatively, they may be conflict-averse or indifferent to sanctioning others, even when facing clear under-contributors in the group. Since they are themselves a moderate, sometimes slightly below-average contributor, they might also be reluctant to act as a “moral enforcer” given their own partial free-riding.\n\nOverall, they fit a “non-punishing opportunist” profile: they accept the punishment institution as a constraint on their own behavior but do not actively use it to shape others’ actions, and they absorb sanctions without escalating or retaliating.", "umap_x": -1.782220482826233, "umap_y": 0.05626227706670761, "cluster_id": 0, "cluster_size": 40, "cluster_title": "Punishment / Contributions / Contribution", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around punishment, contributions, contribution, norm, cooperation."}

They start out relatively generous and remain generally cooperative throughout, with contributions often above the average of others and occasionally at or near full contribution.\n\nTheir pattern shows conditional cooperation: when the group’s environment appears cooperative or improving, they are willing to contribute more and even overshoot typical contributions; when there are clear low contributors or more chaotic contribution patterns, they reduce their own input, but they do not collapse into near-zero giving. Instead of sharply matching the lowest contributors, they appear to balance self-interest with a desire to maintain a functioning public good.\n\nThey do not display a strong trend of monotonic decay in contributions over time; their behavior fluctuates around a medium‑high level rather than steadily dropping. They sometimes increase contributions after low-contribution episodes, indicating responsiveness rather than pure fatigue or end-game unraveling. They also occasionally contribute substantially when doing so is personally costly in the short run, suggesting they value sustaining cooperation or adhering to a fairness norm more than purely maximizing immediate payoff.\n\nThey appear to hold a “fair share plus” norm: they rarely free-ride relative to the group, and often take on a slightly greater burden than many peers, especially when others are cooperating. At the same time, they show some risk sensitivity: they do not blindly give the maximum in uncooperative environments, and they adjust downward when many others contribute very little. This indicates they are attentive to payoff implications and are neither a pure altruist nor a pure egoist.\n\nOverall, they behave as a “prosocial conditional cooperator with moderate self-protection”: willing to pay to sustain cooperation, but adjusting contributions when defecting behavior becomes salient.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nAwareness of the finite horizon does not lead this player to a sharp defection cascade in the last few rounds. Contributions in the final phase remain in the medium‑to‑high range and do not collapse to minimal levels, even in the very last round, where they still contribute a substantial portion of their endowment.\n\nThere is no clear evidence that they treat the closing rounds as an opportunity to exploit the group; instead, they continue to behave in line with their earlier cooperative tendencies. Occasional fluctuations in the late game appear more like context-sensitive adjustments (to the current contribution pattern of others) than a principled “last-round grab.” They do not show a progressive step-down pattern that would signal strong backward induction; their end-game behavior is consistent with either limited horizon reasoning, a preference for maintaining norms even when the game is about to end, or a belief that others will also keep cooperating.\n\nThus, their type is “low unraveling, norm-stable”: they maintain cooperation through the end rather than deliberately exploiting the final opportunities for unilateral gain.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThis player uses punishment intermittently and in a targeted way, not constantly. They are clearly willing to bear personal cost to penalize others, but they do not punish every round nor in proportion to the total number of low contributors present. This pattern suggests selectivity and some deliberation over when punishment is “worth it.”\n\nGiven that punishment is costly and punishment opportunities coincide with visible contribution profiles, the most plausible trigger is perceived free-riding or unusually low contributions relative to the rest of the group. Their punishment is more frequent in environments where some players contribute very little while others contribute a lot, consistent with enforcing a fairness or reciprocity norm. When the overall pattern of contributions is relatively cooperative or when they themselves contribute less, they are more likely to refrain from punishing, indicating they are not simply spiteful or punishment-happy.\n\nTheir own experience of being punished in one round does not lead to a clearly retaliatory spike in their subsequent punishment usage. After being sanctioned, they do not suddenly escalate costly punishment against others in a sustained way. This makes pure revenge or spite a low-confidence motive. Instead, their punishment behavior appears more aligned with norm enforcement and deterrence: picking out clear low contributors to discipline, while tolerating moderate variation.\n\nIn summary, they are a “conditional norm enforcer”: willing to spend on punishment to correct what they see as unfair low contributions, selectively and without clear evidence of vindictive retaliation.", "umap_x": -1.7810819149017334, "umap_y": -0.24001215398311615, "cluster_id": 0, "cluster_size": 40, "cluster_title": "Punishment / Contributions / Contribution", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around punishment, contributions, contribution, norm, cooperation."}

Their default pattern is to contribute a consistent, moderate amount that tracks close to the emerging group norm. They do not push toward full cooperation, but also do not sit at the lowest contributions; they seem comfortable in a “respectable but not maximal” cooperative band.\n\nThey briefly deviate to very low contributions on a couple of occasions after having seen that some others contribute much more and some contribute much less. This suggests they understand the strategic incentive to free-ride and are willing to test it. However, after these low contributions are met with sanctions, they quickly revert to their moderate, stable contribution pattern and maintain it for the rest of the game. That reversion, plus the absence of further low contributions despite some others continuing to under-contribute, indicates that they internalize the lesson that deviating downwards is both risky and socially disapproved.\n\nThey appear conditionally cooperative in a bounded way: they match a mid-range cooperative norm rather than mirror the full spectrum of others’ behavior. When others’ average contributions are high, they do not increase to maximum; when multiple others contribute very low or zero, they do not substantially reduce their own contributions once their norm is established. This suggests they value predictability and a stable strategy over finely tuned responsiveness, and they may be using a simple heuristic like “contribute a fair, round number that feels cooperative” rather than optimizing on each round.\n\nThey tolerate some inequity: they regularly coexist with both higher and lower contributors without adjusting much. This implies either low sensitivity to fairness deviations or a belief that attempting to correct such deviations is not worth the cognitive or strategic effort. Their brief free-riding episodes, followed by compliance, show that they are willing to exploit the group when it seems safe, but they abandon that approach once it is clearly costly.\n\nTheir risk tolerance is moderate. They initially experiment with low contributions despite the presence of punishment, which is risky, but once punished they avoid further experimentation. They are not aggressively opportunistic; instead, they calibrate quickly toward a safer, cooperative equilibrium. Overall, they present as a “norm-following conditional cooperator with limited opportunism”: inclined to cooperate at a moderate level, aware of free-riding incentives, but ultimately deterred by social sanctions and content to stick with a simple, steady rule.\n\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThe player shows strong horizon awareness in the sense that they know the game length, but there is no observable end-game defection. Their contribution level remains essentially unchanged as the final rounds approach and even in the very last round. They neither ramp up cooperation nor exploit the final period to free-ride.\n\nThis absence of end-game decay suggests one of several non-exclusive possibilities: they may anchor on a stable contribution norm and treat each round similarly; they may not prioritize marginal end-of-horizon gains over consistency; or they may expect that others will maintain contributions and see no reason to deviate. There is no evidence of a deliberate “last-round grab,” even though the strategic logic of finitely repeated PGGs would permit it.\n\nBecause they have learned that deviating downward attracts punishment earlier in the game, they might also believe that even late-stage free-riding could be sanctioned, and they are unwilling to risk that. Whether this belief is explicit or just encoded as a simple “don’t rock the boat” heuristic is unknown. In any case, their behavior is horizon-stable: they act as if the shadow of future punishment and/or the value of a consistent strategy persists right up to the end.\n\nThey do not exhibit escalation in cooperation either: they do not increase contributions beyond their usual level to “leave on a good note” or to try to boost the final-round group payoff. This supports the view that they follow a relatively rigid contribution rule rather than dynamically recalibrating to the countdown of remaining rounds.\n\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThe player never uses punishment at any point, despite being exposed repeatedly to others’ contributions that range from zero to maximum. They also receive nontrivial punishment themselves after low contributions, yet they do not retaliate. This consistent non-use of punishment persists regardless of others’ behavior or the remaining rounds.\n\nThis pattern indicates a strong reluctance—or principled refusal—to spend personal resources to sanction others. Whether this stems from prosocial motives (disliking harm) or purely self-interested cost avoidance is unclear. What is clear is that they do not engage in norm enforcement, even when it would align with their later cooperative behavior and even when punishing chronic low contributors might improve future outcomes. They accept being a target of punishment without observable attempts at revenge, suggesting low retributive motivation and a tendency to adapt through changing their own behavior rather than trying to control others.\n\nBecause they never punish when others contribute very low amounts, they likely either believe that the punishment mechanism is inefficient for them personally, or they simply adopt a “live and let live” stance, focusing on their own contributions. There is no evidence they attempt to use punishment for deterrence, coordination, or signaling. Their strategy is purely reactive through contribution adjustments, not active through sanctions.\n\nOverall, they fit a “non-punishing conditional cooperator” profile: they are responsive to being punished—raising their contributions afterward—but they themselves do not impose punishment under any observed condition.", "umap_x": -1.532434344291687, "umap_y": 0.025314180180430412, "cluster_id": 0, "cluster_size": 40, "cluster_title": "Punishment / Contributions / Contribution", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around punishment, contributions, contribution, norm, cooperation."}

Their default norm is “always cooperate fully” rather than “match the group” or “best respond to incentives,” even though the marginal per-capita return is low. They do not appear to optimize for personal payoff; they continue to contribute the maximum even after repeated net losses and repeated punishment from others.\n\nTheir contributions are highly stable for most of the game, with only two clear deviations: a single mid/late-game round and the final round in which they switch to zero contribution. These exceptions are sharp departures from their usual pattern, not gradual decay. This suggests that their baseline rule is categorical (“I give everything”) and that non-contribution is an exceptional, reactive move, not a fine-tuned response to changing averages.\n\nThey do not visibly condition their contributions on others’ average behavior. Average contributions around them fluctuate, and low contributors are present throughout, but this does not lead them to downshift toward the group’s mean. Instead, their cooperative standard is self-imposed and relatively independent of others’ choices. This points to a strong internal fairness or moral norm (“I should contribute fully”) rather than reciprocal tit-for-tat reasoning.\n\nRisk tolerance is high: they consistently expose themselves to exploitation and to punishment risk by being visibly more cooperative than many peers, and they do not hedge by partial contributions. They behave more like an unconditional cooperator with occasional protest/non-cooperation episodes than a cautious or strategic cooperator.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nAwareness of the finite horizon is present but does not drive gradual cooperation decay. For most of the game, including the late-middle phase, they maintain full contributions. There is no smooth end-game unraveling pattern; instead, the response near the horizon is punctuated and reactive.\n\nTwo elements characterize their end-game behavior:\n\n1. **Late reactive defection:** After a long history of full cooperation and substantial use of punishment, they briefly switch to non-contribution once before the final round. This is not aligned with a pure backward-induction logic (which would reduce contributions progressively), but it fits with an emotional/retaliatory or “testing” response to perceived unfairness and hostility (notably, they are repeatedly punished while being a strong contributor).\n\n2. **Final-round withdrawal:** In the last round, they again choose zero contribution. This aligns with a simple heuristic such as “since this is the last chance, and others have not treated me fairly, I no longer owe cooperation.” The fact that they return to full contribution after a prior zero, but drop to zero again only at the very end, suggests they do not fully abandon cooperative identity mid-game; rather, they compartmentalize: “cooperate by default, except in special protest moments and at the true end.”\n\nThere is no evidence they seek to exploit others in the end-game; zero contributions appear tied more to frustration, perceived injustice, or payoff repair than to calculated free-riding on a predictable terminal defection by the group. Their end-game pattern is best described as norm-driven cooperation with late, abrupt exceptions tied to accumulated grievances and the horizon, not as sophisticated horizon-based optimization.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey are willing to use costly punishment and escalate it over time, even when it reduces their own payoffs substantially. Early on, they use punishment sparingly and at low intensity; later, they significantly increase total punishment expenditure. This progression is consistent with growing frustration rather than a pre-planned enforcement schedule.\n\nGiven their consistently high own contributions, the most plausible punishment trigger is norm enforcement against perceived free riders or inconsistent contributors. Their pattern suggests they likely target players who contribute very little or who reduce contributions sharply. Because they themselves are punished multiple times despite high contributions, their later punishment spikes may also incorporate an element of retaliation or generalized anger at the group (“antisocial punishment of antisocial punishers”), though who they target is unknown.\n\nThey are not purely efficiency-oriented: in this environment, punishment is relatively potent but still costly. Their heavy use of it, especially later, indicates they prioritize expressing disapproval and enforcing a cooperative norm over maximizing their own monetary outcome. Deterrence is a plausible motive — trying to discipline chronic low contributors — but the scale and timing of later sanctions (when many rounds have already passed and gains from future cooperation are limited) suggests that emotional or justice-oriented motives are at least as important as instrumental ones.\n\nThey are selective in the sense that they do not punish in every opportunity, and they abstain from punishment in many rounds while still being exploited and punished themselves. This indicates some threshold or internal rule (“tolerate noise, but punish when behavior crosses a line”); the precise trigger is unknown, but it is unlikely to be random, given the sparse early punishment and heavier late use.

Even when facing clear low contributors in the group, they mostly maintain their established contribution level instead of sharply cutting back. This indicates some tolerance for inequality and a preference to avoid escalating contribution volatility.\n\nThey occasionally deviate from their personal norm: once they fully free-ride for a single round and later they briefly lower their contribution, and at the very end they increase it. These shifts are limited in scope and duration, and there is no clear pattern of finely calibrated tit-for-tat. Instead, the behavior fits a “bounded rationality” or “satisficing cooperator” type: they pick a contribution level that seems reasonable, then stick with it unless moved by salient contextual cues.\n\nFairness norms appear present but mild. When their own contribution is roughly in line with the group, they do not adjust aggressively in response to isolated under- or over-contributors. They seem comfortable being slightly above or slightly below many others’ contributions as long as the overall group climate remains moderately cooperative. They does not appear highly risk-seeking in cooperation: they never push to maximal contribution for extended periods to try to lift the group; instead they guard against being too exposed to free-riding.\n\nOverall, they behave like a stable, mid-level cooperator who values group payoff but gives significant weight to protecting their own earnings, and who relies more on a simple heuristic contribution rule than on responsive, round-by-round conditional choices.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThe player shows clear awareness of the game horizon and modestly adjusts behavior near the end, but does not fully unravel cooperation. For most of the game, they keep their contribution close to a stable internal target. Despite the common incentive in such games to gradually decrease contributions as the end approaches, this player maintains their typical level through the late-middle and late game.\n\nIn the very final round, they increase their contribution above their usual choice. This is not consistent with a pure monetary payoff maximizer, who would typically cut contributions at the end if they expect others to do the same. Instead, this late increase suggests at least one of the following, though precise motives are unknown: a concern with ending on a “cooperative” note, a willingness to sacrifice some final-round payoff for social preference reasons, or a belief that contributing more at the end is harmless given that no future punishment or strategic retaliation is possible.\n\nImportantly, they does not show a progressive decline in contributions as the number of remaining rounds shrinks; their contributions stay stable until the last decision, where they shift upwards, not downwards. This pattern is consistent with a player who understands that the game is finite (unknown whether they think through full backward induction) but who does not implement the typical end-game defection cascade. Horizon awareness is thus present but not driving strong decay; end-game behavior instead reflects a modest, possibly norm- or identity-driven boost in cooperation.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThis player uses punishment very sparingly and in a targeted, reactive way. Across the game they almost never spend on punishment, activating it only on rare occasions. When they do choose to punish, it coincides with clear deviations from their usual cooperative pattern, suggesting that punishment is linked to salient frustration or norm-enforcement impulses rather than being part of a consistent strategic toolkit.\n\nBased on the timing and context of the rare punishment instances, the likely trigger is the presence of conspicuously low contributors or free-riders, especially when the group contribution climate deteriorates. They appears to tolerate a degree of heterogeneity in contributions without punishing, so the threshold for acting is relatively high: only when non-cooperation becomes especially salient or personally costly do they expend resources to sanction others.\n\nThere is no evidence that they use punishment as systematic deterrence, nor that they escalate punishment in response to being punished themselves (their received punishment is low and does not produce visible retaliatory patterns). This supports an interpretation of them as a “reluctant enforcer”: they primarily prefers to earn through stable cooperation and personal contributions, resorting to punishment only when they perceive strong norm violations and when their own cooperative stance is already strained.\n\nThey also exhibits no sign of antisocial punishment; they does not target apparent high contributors or cooperators. This aligns with a pro-social, norm-enforcing orientation rather than spite or competitive motives. Overall, they is a low-frequency, selective punisher whose main strategy is to rely on steady contributions rather than on active sanctioning to shape group behavior.", "umap_x": -1.7564167976379395, "umap_y": -0.010255291126668453, "cluster_id": 0, "cluster_size": 40, "cluster_title": "Punishment / Contributions / Contribution", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around punishment, contributions, contribution, norm, cooperation."}

They usually give about half their endowment, occasionally dropping lower and very rarely to zero. Their contributions track the group’s general level of cooperation: when others appear to sustain medium or high giving, they maintain or return to their usual contribution rather than exploiting systematically. When they briefly free‑ride more, they do not make that a new baseline; instead, they revert to the moderate cooperative norm.\n\nThey appear to follow a fairness norm that combines “do my part” with “don’t be a sucker”: they are willing to contribute a meaningful amount to the public good but are not willing to be among the highest givers for long, and they do not consistently match the very top contributors. They do not chase precise equality with the group average; rather, they keep a simple, robust rule of thumb that is roughly in line with typical contributions in the group.\n\nRisk tolerance seems moderate. They are not so risk‑averse that they insist on contributing almost nothing to protect their private payoff, but they also do not gamble on full cooperation by everyone. Once they experience being targeted by punishment for free‑riding, they quickly shift back to being reliably cooperative, suggesting they are sensitive to social or institutional sanctions and prefer to stay within an acceptable cooperative band once norms are made salient.\n\nThey do not exhibit escalating volatility or large swings in their pattern; deviations are relatively small and they often correct back toward their prior cooperative level. This indicates a strategy that is adaptive but not erratic, with a preference for predictable behavior that avoids being singled out as either a major exploiter or an unconditional altruist.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThe player shows clear horizon awareness but does not fully defect at the end. In the final phase of the game, they maintain their characteristic moderate contribution rather than dropping toward zero. Their last‑round behavior is essentially indistinguishable in pattern from their mid‑game behavior. This suggests they either do not strongly apply backward induction or they continue to value norm‑consistency and image (even in an anonymous environment) over the small material gain from last‑round free‑riding.\n\nThere is no sign of systematic cooperation decay as the game approaches its end. Their contributions neither slide downward steadily nor spike upward in a dramatic “last effort.” Instead, their pattern remains relatively stable, indicating that their cooperative rule is not tightly tied to the remaining number of rounds. Any small deviations near the end seem more related to reactions to others’ behavior and punishment use than to end‑game reasoning.\n\nOverall, they treat late rounds as continuations of the same strategic environment and avoid opportunistic end‑game exploitation, favoring consistency with their internal norm of being a moderate contributor.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThis player is a highly active, norm‑enforcing punisher who is willing to spend substantial resources to sanction others. They use punishment intermittently at first and then increasingly heavily over time, especially in the later part of the game. They show a clear focus on enforcing contribution norms: they almost never appear to free‑ride heavily themselves and then punish others for high giving; instead, their punishment use aligns with a role of sanctioning those who contribute far below the informal group standard.\n\nTheir punishment is likely targeted at low contributors and possible repeat offenders. They do not spend on punishment every round, even when some players contribute less than the group average, which implies selectivity: they probably reserve sanctions for clear or persistent deviations from what they perceive as acceptable contributions (e.g., very low or zero contributions, or players who repeatedly lag behind the emerging cooperation level).\n\nThey appear willing to bear significant personal cost to uphold the norm, even when this materially hurts their own payoff in the short run. This favors an interpretation of their punishment as primarily deterrence and norm enforcement rather than narrow retaliation for personal harm. When they themselves free‑ride substantially, they quickly receive punishment from others and respond by resuming cooperative contributions, but they do not then visibly retaliate against high contributors. This is consistent with a person who accepts punishment as a signal of group expectations and then joins in enforcing those expectations on others.\n\nAs the game progresses, they escalate their punishment intensity, suggesting growing frustration with persistent low contributors or a stronger commitment to “cleaning up” norm violations while there is still time to influence behavior. They make no evident attempt to conserve punishment budget in the final rounds; instead, they continue to spend heavily, even when returns in terms of future cooperation are limited. This points to a mix of forward‑looking deterrence and a present‑focused preference for fairness and moral accounting: they want defectors to incur costs, even late in the game.\n\nOverall, this player’s type combines moderate, stable cooperation with a strong readiness to act as a costly enforcer, prioritizing group norm compliance and fairness over maximizing their own immediate earnings.", "umap_x": -1.9304816722869873, "umap_y": -0.07881241291761398, "cluster_id": 0, "cluster_size": 40, "cluster_title": "Punishment / Contributions / Contribution", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around punishment, contributions, contribution, norm, cooperation."}

They frequently contribute around or somewhat above the emerging group norm, but oscillate between high and very low contributions depending on recent experience and perceived fairness. They sometimes choose very high contributions, including full contribution, indicating that they accept personal cost for collective gain when they believe the environment is reasonably cooperative or when they actively test for reciprocity. At other times they sharply reduce contributions to very low or zero, using contribution levels as a way of protecting themselves from perceived exploitation or signaling dissatisfaction.\n\nTheir behavior suggests they attend to others’ contributions and anchor their own roughly to the central cluster of contributors rather than to extreme low contributors. They do not appear to be a pure freerider: they repeatedly give amounts that are clearly above the payoff-maximizing selfish choice in this MPCR environment. However, they are not a stable high cooperator either; cooperation is contingent on perceived group behavior and recent punishment experiences.\n\nThey appear moderately risk-tolerant in trying both high and low contribution strategies rather than locking into a single pattern. They show no clear evidence of strict fairness norms such as “always match the group average” or “always punish all below-average contributors with adjusted contributions”; instead they shift between cooperative and self-protective modes in a somewhat coarse, discrete way. Overall, their contribution profile fits a “reactive, conditional cooperator who fluctuates between engagement and withdrawal” rather than a principled unconditional stance.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThe player is aware of the finite horizon and shows classic end-game defection behavior. As the game approaches its conclusion, they move from willingness to contribute significantly above zero to sharp reductions and finally to complete non-contribution. They do not attempt a last-round cooperative gesture and instead prioritize personal payoff once the opportunity for sustained reciprocal cooperation effectively vanishes.\n\nTheir late-game choices indicate that long-run reputation or future punishment are no longer salient enough to justify costly cooperation; they switch emphasis from group efficiency to individual gain. Exposure to heavy punishment near the end coincides with a sharp drop in their giving, suggesting that negative social feedback at this stage reinforces the logic of “take what you can before it’s over” rather than nudging them back toward cooperation. Overall, in terminal periods they behave as a payoff-focused, distrustful player who no longer expects meaningful cooperative returns from the group.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThis player is a selective but recurrent punisher who uses sanctions both normatively and retaliatorily. They are clearly willing to incur personal cost to punish others multiple times across the game, so they are not punishment-averse. The pattern of use suggests that low contributors are salient targets: they appear to employ punishment as a means of enforcing contribution norms and discouraging what they perceive as free-riding. This aligns with a conditional cooperator who wants to sustain a cooperative environment and is willing to “police” it at a cost.\n\nAt the same time, when they themselves become a target of significant punishment, they do not visibly escalate their own sanctions in a coordinated way, but they do sharply reduce their contributions. This indicates that punishment directed at them is interpreted more as hostility or exploitation than as constructive feedback. Their punishment thus seems more deterrence-oriented when they wield it (aimed at others’ deviations) and more resentment-inducing when they receive it. Because punishers are anonymous, they cannot easily retaliate directly, which may contribute to their withdrawal into low contributions rather than targeted counter-punishment.\n\nThey show moderate intensity in punishment: they are willing to spend several units in some periods, but they do not engage in extreme, systematic punishment of all below-norm contributors. This suggests a player who values enforcing cooperation but balances that with their own payoff, using punishment as a tool rather than as an overriding goal. Their punishment behavior thus reflects a norm-enforcing, emotionally reactive type who is sensitive to fairness but not committed to maximal sanctioning.", "umap_x": -1.6293704509735107, "umap_y": -0.5668777227401733, "cluster_id": 0, "cluster_size": 40, "cluster_title": "Punishment / Contributions / Contribution", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around punishment, contributions, contribution, norm, cooperation."}

Their default choice is a very small contribution, typically at the extreme low end relative to the group. They occasionally increase contributions into a moderate range, but these changes are sparse, brief, and not sustained; there is no smooth trend or strong adjustment pattern, so their strategy appears more like opportunistic tinkering than principled reciprocity.\n\nThey consistently benefit from others’ higher contributions and do not move toward the group average even when most others contribute much more. When they do contribute more, they still remain at or below the prevailing average, suggesting they are not aiming at fairness or equal burden-sharing. Instead, they appear comfortable being one of the lowest contributors in a generally cooperative environment.\n\nTheir behavior fits a payoff-focused, risk-averse free-rider: they usually keep most of their endowment, willing to tolerate substantial social sanctions before seriously reconsidering their contribution level. Large deductions directed at them lead only to temporary and partial increases in contribution, and they soon revert to low levels once the immediate pressure seems to subside. This pattern indicates low sensitivity to social norms and relatively high tolerance for being perceived as unfair, at least when sanctions are intermittent or uncoordinated.\n\nOverall, they behave as a “stubborn low conditional cooperator”: they recognize that others are contributing and sometimes adjust slightly upward, but they anchor around low contributions and treat cooperation as something to be minimally complied with rather than embraced.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThe player shows little classic end-game unraveling because they are already operating near a low, self-interested baseline throughout. In the final segment of the game, they do not further reduce contributions as the horizon approaches; if anything, their contributions become modestly higher and somewhat more stable than their typical low level.\n\nThis lack of decay suggests they either (a) do not place much weight on dynamic reputation and thus have no extra incentive to defect at the end, or (b) already defect so much that there is no meaningful room to “unravel” further. The modest increase in contributions near the very end coexists with ongoing evidence that they remain below or around the group average; thus, it is unlikely to reflect altruistic end-game generosity. More plausibly, it reflects a cautious attempt to avoid further punishment or a simple heuristic of “trying a bit harder” when the game feels close to finishing.\n\nThey clearly understand that there is a fixed horizon and rounds are counting down, because the interface provides that information, but there is no strong behavioral signal that they are strategically timing cooperation or defection based on remaining rounds. Their type is best characterized as weakly horizon-aware: they know the end is coming but do not systematically shift strategy in a way consistent with sophisticated backward induction or calculated last-round defection.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThe player never uses the punishment option, even when confronted with peers who contribute very little or when they themselves are repeatedly and heavily sanctioned. This uniform refusal to spend on punishment holds in cooperative, mixed, and low-contribution environments, and persists even after they suffer large payoff losses from being punished by others.\n\nTheir non-use of punishment is not explained by a lack of candidates: within the environment, some peers contribute at or near zero, and there are numerous opportunities to target clear free-riders or to retaliate against perceived attackers. The player nonetheless always chooses to preserve their own payoff rather than pay to discipline others. This points to a strongly payoff-maximizing stance on the punishment dimension: they appear unwilling to sacrifice even small amounts to enforce norms, support cooperation, or retaliate.\n\nThe fact that they continue to free-ride while facing substantial deductions, yet still do not retaliate, suggests that deterrence and revenge motives are weak or absent. They appear to accept punishment as a cost of their strategy rather than responding with counter-punishment. There is no sign of “anti-social” punishment from them, nor of “moralistic” punishment: they are simply non-punishers.\n\nTaken together, their type is a non-punishing, low-contributing free-rider who prioritizes immediate private payoff over norm enforcement, shows limited responsiveness to social sanctions, and does not expend resources to influence others’ behavior, whether for prosocial or retaliatory reasons.", "umap_x": -1.694620966911316, "umap_y": -0.15225957334041595, "cluster_id": 0, "cluster_size": 40, "cluster_title": "Punishment / Contributions / Contribution", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around punishment, contributions, contribution, norm, cooperation."}

Their contributions track the general cooperation climate: when others appear to be contributing reasonably well, they maintain or increase their own contributions; when the environment looks more erratic or less cooperative, they allow themselves some under-contribution, including rare very low contributions. Overall, they behave more generously than a pure free-rider but less than an unconditionally altruistic type.\n\nTheir pattern is neither rigid nor wildly volatile. They adjust in small to medium steps rather than jumping arbitrarily. These adjustments suggest they care about how their behavior fits into the group context and about their own payoff, balancing the two. There is no evidence of a strict fairness rule like “always match the group average” or “match the highest contributor”; instead they seem to aim to be somewhere in the cooperative majority when they perceive one, but they are willing to deviate downward for self-interest on some occasions.\n\nThey tolerate being slightly above or below what many others do, indicating moderate, not extreme, fairness concerns. They do not insist on strict equality and are willing to accept some asymmetry, including sometimes benefitting from others’ higher cooperation and sometimes contributing more than several peers. When they free-ride, they do so selectively rather than systematically, which suggests opportunism constrained by some internal norm of “not always being the bad actor.”\n\nFrom a risk perspective, their behavior is moderately risk-averse regarding payoffs: they rarely sacrifice large amounts in ways that would be extremely costly relative to what others do, and their higher contributions are more common in contexts where the group’s cooperation is already nontrivial. At the same time, they are not purely payoff-maximizing in the game-theoretic sense, since they are frequently willing to contribute more than the minimal selfish best response. This combination points to a player who values both earnings and participation in cooperation, without fully committing to either extreme.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThe player shows clear awareness of the game horizon and does not follow the classic end-game decay predicted by backward induction. Instead, they escalate their cooperation at the very end, culminating in fully cooperative choices in the final stages. This indicates that they do not treat the last rounds as an opportunity to “cash out” via maximum free-riding.\n\nThis terminal escalation suggests one or more of the following, all with low to moderate confidence: they may hold a norm of “finishing well,” they may derive intrinsic satisfaction from cooperating even when instrumental incentives are weaker, or they may hope that others sustain or increase cooperation despite the approaching end. There is no observable effort to exploit the final round by minimizing contributions, so strategic last-round defection is not part of their behavioral repertoire here.\n\nTheir choices also indicate that negative experiences (such as being punished earlier in the game) do not push them into a retaliatory end-game spiral of defection. Instead, they maintain or raise their cooperative stance as the game closes. They appear more inclined to define their end-game identity around contributing rather than around maximizing short-run earnings.\n\nOverall, the end-game response suggests a cooperative self-concept that is somewhat robust to standard deterioration incentives. They are willing to leave money on the table in the final round in order to act in line with that self-concept or with a perceived social norm of contributing, even without expectation of future reciprocation.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThe player never uses the punishment mechanism, despite multiple opportunities and despite sometimes facing peers who contribute noticeably less than others and being personally targeted by punishment on some occasions. This consistent non-use indicates a strong reluctance to incur personal costs to sanction others.\n\nFrom this alone, their underlying motive is uncertain. Several interpretations are possible, all with low to moderate confidence: they may dislike the idea of harming others, even at a profit to group efficiency; they may doubt the effectiveness of punishment in this anonymous, one-shot-per-round setting; or they may simply prioritize their own earnings and choose not to spend coins on sanctions. What is clear is that they do not practice altruistic punishment, even when the technology is relatively efficient.\n\nEqually important, they do not retaliate when they themselves are punished. Their contributions after being sanctioned do not switch into a consistently vengeful or punitive mode. They do not engage in “counter-punishment” or use the mechanism to teach others a lesson or to push the group toward a norm. This absence of retaliation suggests a relatively low propensity for spite and a reluctance to escalate conflicts.\n\nThey also never experiment with small, targeted punishment to probe others’ responsiveness, which indicates little interest in using sanctions as an active coordination device. Instead, they appear to rely purely on their own contribution choices as their main lever of influence on the group, implicitly accepting whatever others do, including both low contributions and incoming punishment.

Contributions cluster around the middle-to-high range, with several instances of full or near-full giving, but there are also clear dips to very low levels. The player is not a pure free rider: in many situations they give an amount comparable to or above the apparent group midpoint. At the same time, they never settle into a stable, uniform contribution rule.\n\nTheir contributions are sensitive to the surrounding environment rather than purely random. When the apparent cooperation climate looks strong, they are willing to match or exceed a typical mid-range effort, and at times commit their full endowment. When there are salient low contributors or when they likely feel targeted or exploited, they sharply reduce their own giving, suggesting a reciprocity-based or fairness-based rule (“I contribute if others also do their part; I pull back if I feel others or the system treat me unfairly”).\n\nThey appear aware that partial free-riding improves individual payoffs while still benefiting from the group’s public pool, but they do not consistently exploit this. Instead, they oscillate between cooperative and self-protective modes. This pattern suggests they value fairness and reciprocity, but also monitor their own payoff and are willing to deviate from cooperative norms when they feel justified. Risk tolerance seems moderate: they are willing to “risk” high contributions in a potentially cooperative environment, but also quickly hedge when signs of exploitation or hostility appear.\n\nOverall, they fit a “conditional cooperator with defensive opportunism” profile: inclined to contribute meaningfully, but willing to cut back when they perceive either unfair low contributions by others or unjust treatment via punishment.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nAwareness of the game horizon does not lead to a simple monotonic decline in cooperation. Instead, their behavior near the end shows sharp, context-driven swings. In late rounds they both dramatically under-contribute at one point and then revert to very high contributions soon after, followed again by moderate giving in the final decision. This rules out a straightforward “end-game unraveling” strategy in which they systematically reduce contributions as the final round approaches.\n\nThe abrupt late under-contribution followed by extremely heavy punishment against them indicates that they anticipate, or at least experience, strong social sanctions for very low giving. Their immediate, substantial rebound to high contribution afterward suggests they are responsive to such feedback and perhaps attempt to repair reputation or avoid repeat punishment, even with few rounds remaining. The final-round contribution then drops back to a moderate level, which may reflect a mixture of lingering caution, payoff focus, and reduced long-term reputational concern once the horizon is imminent.\n\nIncentive-wise, they continue to care about both payoff and social standing right up to the last rounds; they do not adopt a purely selfish “take everything” strategy at the end. Instead, they seem to balance: they are willing to restore cooperation after being sanctioned, but they do not maintain maximum generosity when no future interaction is expected. Their end-game pattern fits a horizon-aware, feedback-sensitive type rather than a purely forward-looking optimizer or a purely myopic defector.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThis player is a selective, norm-enforcing punisher who uses sanctions intermittently rather than constantly. They do not punish in every round, nor do they appear to punish indiscriminately; instead, they expend punishment resources in certain periods where low or exploitative contributions are especially salient. The overall pattern is: they generally refrain from punishing when group contributions are reasonably aligned with their own, and they step in with non-trivial punishment costs when they likely perceive clear deviation from a cooperation norm.\n\nThey do not exhibit systematic retaliation against every instance of being punished themselves. At several points they are punished but do not respond with obvious counter-punishment (identity of punishers is unknown, but their own punishment spending does not spike mechanically after being sanctioned). This suggests that while they do not enjoy being punished, their main motive in using punishment seems closer to norm enforcement or deterrence of low contributors rather than pure revenge. However, some of their punishment episodes occur after they have varied their own contribution level, so there is some ambiguity about whether frustration with being sanctioned or with group behavior also feeds into their decisions; confidence about the exact target and motive is low.\n\nWhen they do punish, they are willing to spend multiple punishment units in a single round, implying they take the tool seriously and accept costly sanctions if they believe they are correcting unfair free-riding. They do not, however, escalate punishment spending over time, nor do they sustain a “punishment campaign” across many rounds. This indicates a controlled rather than impulsive style: they use punishment as a situational response, not as a standing strategy.\n\nOverall, they fit the profile of a conditional cooperator who occasionally assumes a “moral enforcer” role, willing to incur personal cost to discipline perceived norm violators, but who does not obsessively retaliate or punish for its own sake.", "umap_x": -1.8554068803787231, "umap_y": -0.48641788959503174, "cluster_id": 0, "cluster_size": 40, "cluster_title": "Punishment / Contributions / Contribution", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around punishment, contributions, contribution, norm, cooperation."}

They contribute the maximum endowment in almost every round, even when others do not strictly need reinforcement or coordination to keep contributing. They briefly reduce their contribution slightly in two later rounds when the group composition or contributions shift, but they still remain above the group average and return to full contributions immediately afterward. This pattern suggests they prioritize maintaining group efficiency and fairness over short-term individual gain and are willing to accept personal risk to sustain high cooperation. Their behavior appears only weakly conditional: they do not clearly tit-for-tat or calibrate contributions in a fine-grained way in response to others’ deviations, and they do not use contribution changes to discipline others. Instead, they seem anchored on a “cooperate fully by default” norm, with minor downward adjustments when the environment becomes noisier, then a reversion to full cooperation. They show no evidence of trying to free-ride or exploit others’ generosity.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThey communicate minimally and with a light, humorous tone. They participate in social banter rather than strategic coordination, making a joke about another player’s exit rather than discussing contribution levels or punishment norms. They do not propose explicit strategies, nor do they reinforce others’ cooperative suggestions in chat. They also do not comment on the appearance or disappearance of players, on deviations from full cooperation, or on punishment events. This indicates a low-visibility, low-leadership communication style: they rely on their actions to signal cooperation rather than on verbal persuasion. Their engagement is present but sparse, and they appear comfortable letting others drive any explicit coordination.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThey show limited but noticeable end-game adjustment. Late in the game, when the horizon is relatively close and group behavior becomes less uniform, they temporarily reduce their contributions while still remaining cooperative relative to others. However, they do not follow through with a full end-game unraveling; they subsequently revert to maximum contributions even when the game is nearly over. This suggests some awareness that the environment is changing as the end approaches, but their underlying cooperative norm remains dominant over pure backward-induction logic. They do not appear to adopt a “grab what you can at the end” mindset; instead, they briefly test lower contributions under uncertainty and then recommit to high cooperation, implying a preference for consistency and group welfare even near the final round.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey never use the punishment mechanism, despite having multiple opportunities and clear visibility of others’ deviations and of at least one player engaging in costly, strong punishment. Their restraint holds even when some players contribute less than the group norm and when punishment would be relatively effective and cheap. This consistent non-use indicates a strong reluctance to impose costs on others, even for norm enforcement. They do not engage in altruistic punishment, do not retaliate, and do not attempt to correct low contributors by sanctioning them. Their type is best described as non-punitive and forgiveness-biased: they prefer absorbing small inefficiencies or inequities over actively harming another player’s payoff, even in a context where punishment is normatively framed as an enforcement tool.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nThey are never punished by others, so their direct behavioral response to being sanctioned is unknown. However, they witness at least one instance of another player spending to punish a low contributor, and they neither copy that behavior nor escalate punishment. They also do not reward punishers verbally or behaviorally. This suggests they are not easily influenced into adopting punitive strategies simply because they see others doing so. Whether they would forgive or retaliate if personally punished remains unknown.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey observe variations in others’ contributions and outcomes, including a case where a lower contributor is heavily punished and where one player spends a moderate amount on punishment. They do not comment on these events, adjust their cooperation to reward or protect victims or punishers, or take advantage of temporarily weaker opponents. Their small temporary drop in contribution coincides with broader group instability rather than appearing targeted at any specific individual’s payoff.

They always contribute their entire endowment in every available decision, with no visible adjustment to others’ behavior, payoff changes, or round number.

They continue to contribute fully even when the group temporarily reduces contributions and even when this leaves them worse off than others. They demonstrate strong adherence to a fairness or efficiency norm (“everyone maxes every time”) and implicitly accept personal payoff risk to maintain that norm. Sensitivity to relative payoff is low: being exploited and even directly punished does not change their contribution behavior. The evidence suggests a rule-based cooperative type rather than a payoff-maximizer.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThey communicate rarely but in a cooperative, affirming tone.

Later, they make a brief reflective comment expressing appreciation for a smooth, fully cooperative environment and implicitly contrasting it with less cooperative games. They do not initiate detailed coordination or negotiations, nor do they attempt to persuade defectors back into line; their engagement is low-frequency but clearly supportive of group cooperation. They respond to the social atmosphere more than they shape it, and they do not use chat to confront, threaten, or bargain.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThey show no visible end-game defection. Even when other players reduce contributions late in the game and they are materially exploited, they continue to contribute fully both immediately afterward and in the final round.

This strongly suggests that they either (a) disfavor costly punishment on normative grounds (e.g., “don’t be spiteful,” “keep the gains”), or (b) prioritize preserving earnings over enforcing norms, even though they personally uphold those norms through their contributions. They do not engage in second-order punishment (punishing free riders) or third-party retaliation on behalf of others. Their role is that of a non-punishing cooperator rather than a conditional cooperator/enforcer.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nWhen they are directly and heavily punished late in the game, they neither retaliate nor reduce their contribution. They do not punish the identifiable punisher, even though the mechanism and identities are transparent, and even though retaliation would be financially impactful. Their behavior shows high tolerance and absence of vindictiveness. They also do not alter chat to confront, complain, or seek explanation; they remain silent on the incident. This suggests a forgiving or at least non-confrontational stance: they absorb the loss and continue to play cooperatively without overt response.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey observe others’ outcomes—including deviations from full contribution, use of punishment against a low contributor, and later punishment against themselves—but there is no behavioral sign that they adjust their strategy based on these observations. They do not reward or punish based on others’ payoffs, and they do not comment on payoff disparities. Their earlier cooperative affirmation in chat indicates that they value a “money printer” style, high-contribution equilibrium and appreciate when everyone benefits equally from it, but they do not act to correct deviations from that state beyond maintaining their own full contributions. Their attention to others’ outcomes seems conceptually present (they understand when things are going smoothly or not) but not operationalized into contingent actions. Overall, they are a steadfast, norm-following cooperator who neither enforces norms through punishment nor reacts behaviorally to being exploited or punished.", "umap_x": -0.38960087299346924, "umap_y": -0.30328384041786194, "cluster_id": 4, "cluster_size": 43, "cluster_title": "Punishment / Contribution / Reward", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around punishment, contribution, reward, cooperation, behavior."}

They consistently give their entire endowment to the public account whenever the rest of the group is also fully contributing. They maintain this pattern for almost all rounds, including early and mid-game, indicating that they prioritize collective efficiency over individual short-term gain and are not testing the group with small deviations. Their contributions only drop in the very few instances when the group composition or contributions change (e.g., when previously absent or low-contributing members appear), where they reduce their own contribution but still remain above the group average. This suggests a mild conditional-cooperator layer: they accept slight efficiency loss and some inequity but do adjust modestly when the cooperative norm appears less secure. They do not escalate into strong free-riding even then. They seem comfortable with risk in the sense of committing fully early on without knowing others’ types, relying on mutual cooperation as the default. Fairness norms appear group-focused rather than strictly individual: they tolerate some variation in others’ contributions without reacting through punishment or large contribution cuts, as long as the group-level outcome stays high.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThey communicate briefly, with a light, casual tone. Early on, they explicitly propose a simple cooperation norm (“max every time?”) rather than waiting to see what others do, indicating a proactive but low-pressure approach to coordination. They show situational awareness (remarking on a player’s exit and later joking about the profitable situation), using humor rather than moralizing. They are responsive enough to acknowledge events in the game and to nudge others to keep the game moving, but do not dominate the chat or attempt elaborate persuasion. Once a stable cooperative equilibrium is reached, they largely stop discussing strategy; their communication shifts to small comments rather than ongoing enforcement or negotiation. Overall, their style is friendly, succinct, and norm-establishing, without confrontational or accusatory language.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThey show limited and somewhat muted end-game defection. As the horizon approaches, when new or previously inactive players reappear and contribute less, they modestly reduce their own contribution while still contributing more than the new group average and securing a high payoff. This indicates awareness of the changing environment and possible end-game incentives, but they do not embrace a full unraveling of cooperation. In the final round, once the group returns to full contributions, they immediately revert to full cooperation, even though there is no future to influence. That pattern suggests that their contributions are partly driven by a rule-based or identity-based cooperative norm (“we contribute max when others do”) rather than pure backward induction. Overall, end-game effects are present but weak: they fine-tune rather than abandon cooperation.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey never use the punishment option, even when others undercontribute or when a large, hard-to-justify punishment is imposed by another player. They also never experiment with small, symbolic punishment. This pattern suggests a strong reluctance to incur personal cost to sanction others, even when punishment is quite efficient. Possible motives include a preference for maintaining a positive, low-conflict atmosphere; a belief that the cooperative norm can be sustained without explicit sanctions; or a strategic preference to avoid starting punishment cycles. Their behavior is more aligned with “cooperative non-punisher” or “peaceful contributor” types rather than “altruistic punisher” or “moral enforcer.” They appear to rely on coordination and mutual expectations, not on formal punishment, to sustain cooperation.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nThey are never targeted with punishment, so there is no direct evidence of how they respond to being punished. Their own absence of punishment toward others, even after seeing someone use it heavily, suggests they are unlikely to retaliate or to engage in counter-punishment. They do not comment on the punisher’s action in chat, implying either indifference, strategic silence, or a desire to avoid interpersonal conflict. Overall, their response to punishers is best characterized as non-engagement and tolerance, though this inference is low confidence because of limited observation.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey pay enough attention to notice others’ presence and absence and to see that everyone is profiting from the cooperative scheme, which they describe positively. They do not publicly react to others’ differential payoffs when small contribution deviations occur, nor to large punishment events imposed by other players, even though those significantly affect individual earnings. Their behavior remains stable and non-punitive in the face of these outcome disparities, suggesting that they prioritize the stability of the cooperative norm and their own earnings over addressing perceived unfairness via costly action. Their mild adjustment in contribution when some players contribute less is their only observable response to changed outcomes; they do not try to correct others’ behavior or rebalance payoffs through sanctions. Overall, they are outcome-aware but pragmatically hands-off, accepting some inequity as long as the group remains broadly profitable.", "umap_x": -0.7064615488052368, "umap_y": -0.26658445596694946, "cluster_id": 0, "cluster_size": 40, "cluster_title": "Punishment / Contributions / Contribution", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around punishment, contributions, contribution, norm, cooperation."}

They almost always contribute the maximum possible amount and maintain this across essentially the entire game, including both early and late stages. The only deviations are two instances of half-contribution when a low-contribution player reappears and when several others reduce contributions near the end; even then, the player still contributes a positive amount and remains above or around the emerging group average. Their default norm is that everyone should contribute fully, and they behave as if the “max every time” idea is an agreed standard.\n\nThey show no clear signs of conditional cooperation based on fine-grained differences in others’ contributions; they keep contributing maximally even after brief deviations by others and after seeing punishment in the environment. Their behavior suggests they prioritize maintaining group efficiency and stability over short-term individual gain. Risk tolerance appears moderate: they are willing to risk sustaining full cooperation even when there is some uncertainty (e.g., a rejoining participant or temporary contribution dips by others) rather than experimenting or hedging for personal profit.\n\nOverall, they fit a “principled cooperator” or “norm-following altruist” type: they act as if maximally efficient cooperation is the correct strategy and stick to it consistently, with only minimal late-stage softening.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nTheir communication is sparse, responsive, and affiliative. They agree early to the “max every time” proposal with a very brief confirmation and offer a light, friendly reaction to a joke. They do not initiate strategic discussions, do not comment on others’ specific contributions or punishment, and do not attempt to coordinate end-game tactics or sanctioning.\n\nTone is relaxed and pro-social, with no signs of hostility, blame, or moralizing. They appear comfortable aligning with a cooperative group norm but do not take a verbal leadership role. Their style is “quiet joiner”: they affirm group decisions with minimal text and then rely on behavior (consistent contributions) rather than persuasion or argument.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThey display only a very mild end-game adjustment. As the game approaches the final rounds and some players reduce contributions or rejoin with lower contributions, this player briefly lowers their own contribution but does not move toward defection. They quickly revert to full contribution even in the very last round, despite the absence of future interaction.\n\nThis pattern suggests awareness that the horizon is finite (known from the instructions) but little willingness to exploit it. If anything, they seem to treat the cooperative arrangement as something to be upheld through to the end, with only small, possibly experimental or cautious deviations when the group’s behavior becomes less predictable. There is no evidence of calculated last-round opportunism.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey never use the punishment mechanism, despite multiple opportunities and despite punishment being observable and sometimes used by others. They refrain from punishing even when others contribute less than the previous cooperative norm and even when low contributors are punished by someone else.\n\nThis indicates a strong reluctance to spend resources on sanctioning, even when punishment is relatively efficient and social norms might support punishing free riders. Their default is “non-punishing cooperators”: they cooperate but do not enforce cooperation via costly sanctions. Their motives appear more oriented to positive efficiency (contribute, keep the money “printer” running) than to deterrence or retribution.\n\nBecause they never punish, it is unknown how selective or proportional they would be if they did. There is also no evidence of retaliatory punishment; they do not engage with the punishment system at all.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nThey are never punished in this game, so direct reactions to being targeted are unknown. Given their consistent high contributions and absence of any sanctions against them, they have no occasion to show whether they would respond with forgiveness, retaliation, or compliance.\n\nTheir response to others’ use of punishment is muted: they do not comment on punishers in chat, do not mirror the behavior by punishing the same targets, and do not adjust their own contributions in response to observed punishments. This suggests a tendency not to engage in second-order sanctioning and a generally non-confrontational style, but this inference is low confidence, as we lack a case where they are personally affected.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey see others’ contribution changes and payoff outcomes (including when some players under-contribute and are punished or when certain players spend heavily to punish), yet they do not visibly react in chat or via changes in their own punishment behavior. Their contributions are largely insensitive to these outcome shifts: they maintain the cooperative pattern, briefly reduce contributions alongside others late, then return to full cooperation.\n\nThey do not openly approve or disapprove of punishment, and they do not exploit situations where others lose payoff through being punished. Their own occasional small deviations from full contribution occur at times when group contributions fall or composition shifts, but they do not appear to be a direct response to who gained or lost what through punishment. They act as if the main relevant outcome is whether the group is still broadly cooperating, not the detailed distribution of payoffs or sanction costs.\n\nOverall, their reaction to others’ outcomes is best characterized as “observant but behaviorally steady”: they stay cooperative, do not join in sanctioning, and do not visibly adjust strategy based on who is winning or losing.", "umap_x": -0.610929548740387, "umap_y": -0.17884600162506104, "cluster_id": 4, "cluster_size": 43, "cluster_title": "Punishment / Contribution / Reward", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around punishment, contribution, reward, cooperation, behavior."}

They contribute their entire endowment in literally every observed round, including when others under-contribute and when the game is about to end. Their behavior indicates a strong efficiency norm: they appear to focus on maximizing group payoff rather than personal short-term gain, even when the endgame is imminent and defection is strategically tempting. There is no evidence of conditional cooperation based on others’ contributions; they do not reduce their contribution in response to free-riding episodes. Fairness concerns seem secondary to maintaining a simple, cooperative rule (“always max”) that yields a predictable, high group benefit. Risk tolerance appears high with respect to being exploited: they continue to fully cooperate even when some others start giving significantly less. There is no observed volatility; the contribution pattern is perfectly consistent across the entire interaction.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThey communicate sparsely but in a friendly and lightly humorous way. They agree early with a suggestion to always contribute the maximum, helping to establish a simple cooperative norm. Their messages reference game interface details and shared experience, indicating engagement and a mild, playful tone rather than strategic bargaining or pressure. They do not directly criticize or confront low contributors and do not try to organize punishment. Coordination is mostly limited to affirming existing norms and expressing satisfaction with mutual cooperation, rather than actively steering others. Responsiveness to chat is selective but timely; they respond to others’ remarks and join in small talk, signaling sociability without seeking dominance or detailed planning.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThere is no observable end-game decay in cooperation. They maintain maximal contributions through the final rounds, including after others begin to reduce contributions. They behave as if the shadow of the future does not change their rule: the same cooperative strategy holds from start to finish. This suggests either a principled or habitual approach (“always cooperate”) rather than a forward-looking strategic adjustment to the finite horizon. They do not increase punishment or alter communication as the game nears completion. Whether they are explicitly thinking about the known number of remaining rounds is unknown, but their actions do not exhibit typical end-game unraveling.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey almost never punish. The one clear instance is targeted at a player who contributes substantially less than the established full-cooperation norm while re-entering the game; the punishment is minimal in absolute cost and appears selective and norm-based rather than spiteful. They do not punish moderate under-contributors in other mixed-contribution episodes, suggesting a high tolerance threshold or a reluctance to spend on sanctions unless a deviation is especially salient to them. They never use punishment against other high contributors, and there is no evidence of antisocial or retaliatory punishment. Their general stance is “cooperate and mostly ignore deviations,” with rare, light norm enforcement when free-riding crosses a perceived line.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nThey are never punished by others, so direct behavioral responses to punishment cannot be observed. Consequently, their likelihood of retaliating, complying, or forgiving when targeted is unknown. Based on their overall cooperative and non-confrontational style, one might suspect they lean toward non-retaliatory responses, but this is speculative and thus low confidence.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey consistently observe others’ payoffs and punishment patterns but remain behaviorally steady: full contribution and almost no punishment, regardless of how earnings or sanctions are distributed. Visible punishment of others does not induce them to change their own cooperation or to join in sanctioning. They express general appreciation for the “nice” cooperative state of the group, but do not comment directly on specific payoff differences or sanction magnitudes. This indicates a focus on the collective good and stable norms, with relatively little emotional or strategic reaction to short-term inequality or to other players’ use (or non-use) of punishment. Their primary “response” to others’ outcomes is to continue being reliably cooperative.", "umap_x": -0.6324498057365417, "umap_y": -0.352016419172287, "cluster_id": 4, "cluster_size": 43, "cluster_title": "Punishment / Contribution / Reward", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around punishment, contribution, reward, cooperation, behavior."}
{"experiment": "3p9Tuh3Z59cdmPNA7", "participant": "ohyMWtv53vQEb3QFs", "game_finished": true, "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a strict, unconditional full cooperator. They always contribute their entire endowment, with no variation, throughout the game. Their behavior does not respond to others’ deviations from cooperation; they maintain full contributions even when others reduce theirs and even when this clearly lowers their own payoff relative to some group members. They follow a strong fairness/cooperation norm that is not contingent on short-term gain. They appear risk-acceptant with respect to exploitation: they accept a real risk (and occasional reality) of being the highest contributor while others free-ride. There is no evidence that they experiment with lower contributions or try to test others’ responses, suggesting a rule-based or principled strategy rather than strategic adaptation.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThey never speak in the chat. This is consistent across all stages, including early coordination, mid-game, and after the first appearance of defection. They do not publicly endorse norms, request strategies, or react verbally to jokes or to punishment events. This silence suggests a non-engagement or observer style in communication: they let others coordinate and comment while they simply play. It is unknown whether this reflects shyness, indifference to social signaling, or a deliberate decision to avoid influencing others; confidence on motive is low.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThey show no end-game decay in cooperation. Even when others reduce contributions near the end and when there is clear horizon information, they continue to contribute fully. After a late deviation where they do use punishment, they immediately return to full cooperation in the final round, not shifting to self-protection or revenge. They do not appear to adopt the usual backward-induction logic; they keep behaving as if the cooperative norm should hold until the very last round. Their horizon awareness in terms of payoff optimization is unknown; behavior indicates either disregard for end-game incentives or a strong commitment to a stable norm that overrides such considerations.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nMost of the time they do not use punishment, even when it is available and when others defect. Their baseline is “no punishment.” However, they are willing to punish in a highly selective and very costly way when there is both (a) noticeable under-contribution in the group and (b) a specific individual who remains fully cooperative while others free-ride. In that situation they target the single full cooperator with substantial punishment, despite that player’s high contribution. This choice is not consistent with straightforward norm-enforcing altruistic punishment; instead it resembles anti-social or competitive punishment, or a misdirected attempt to discipline “out-of-step” behavior that happens to be overly cooperative relative to a partially defecting group. Because they do not punish the under-contributors in that same phase, their use of punishment appears non-standard: they are either confused about who is responsible for the payoff drop, resent a particular player for reasons not visible in the payoff data (unknown), or derive some satisfaction from harming a high earner even at personal cost. After this one strong punishment act, they revert to not using punishment again. Overall, they are a rare, high-intensity punisher rather than a consistent, low-level enforcer.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nThey are never directly punished in the transcript, so their explicit response when personally targeted is unknown. They do not experience any payoff deductions from others’ punishment, so there is no observed scope for retaliation or compliance behavior. Their behavior after witnessing others’ punishment of a low contributor (not directed at them) does not change: they maintain full contributions and do not start punishing themselves. Thus, they do not clearly imitate the punisher or escalate a punishment norm in response. Their attitude toward identifiable punishers—whether trusting, fearful, vengeful, or appreciative—is unknown.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey consistently maintain their strategy regardless of the distribution of others’ payoffs, punishment expenditures, or deductions. When another player uses costly punishment to hit a low contributor, they do not respond by adjusting contributions or joining in punishment. When some players free-ride and earn more than them in a given round, they do not reduce their contributions, nor do they punish those free-riders. When their own payoff is significantly reduced by their single use of punishment against a cooperative player, they do not continue that pattern or attempt to rebalance earnings later. There is no observable sensitivity to relative earnings, inequality, or to who “deserves” more or less based on contributions, beyond that one ambiguous punishment decision. Overall, they appear payoff-insensitive in their contribution behavior and mostly passive with respect to others’ outcomes, aside from a single, isolated punishment that is not clearly aligned with standard fairness norms.", "umap_x": -0.6395813822746277, "umap_y": -0.5862103700637817, "cluster_id": 4, "cluster_size": 43, "cluster_title": "Punishment / Contribution / Reward", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around punishment, contribution, reward, cooperation, behavior."}

Early on, they repeatedly give their entire endowment to the public fund regardless of others’ below-full contributions, indicating a strong initial cooperative or norm-following inclination rather than immediate payoff maximization. They do not appear highly risk-averse about being the “sucker” at first; they are willing to contribute fully even when several others give nothing.\n\nAs the game proceeds and antisocial punishment and turmoil increase, they gradually decrease their contributions and eventually switch to systematically keeping their entire endowment. This shift suggests they update based on the emerging environment: when cooperation is not rewarded and punishment becomes erratic, they prioritize self-payoff and protection over sustaining the public good. Their change is not random; it coincides with an environment where contribution is frequently met with punishment and where others show inconsistent cooperation.\n\nThey seem to care about fairness in a basic sense—contributing fully when they believe that’s the “right” thing in a structured environment—but they do not blindly persist once it appears that high contributors are treated no better, and sometimes worse, than free-riders. Overall, they are best characterized as an initially pro-social, norm-oriented participant who becomes strategically self-interested when cooperative norms appear to fail.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThis player uses punishment sparingly, selectively, and almost exclusively in a norm-enforcing, pro-social way. When they do punish, they target clear relative low contributors rather than high contributors or cooperators. The amount they spend on punishment is modest compared to others’ often large expenditures, indicating a preference for low-intensity, targeted sanctions rather than aggressive or spiteful punishment.\n\nThey never engage in obvious antisocial punishment of high contributors, nor do they join large “dogpiles” on a single target when there is no clear contribution-based justification. They also refrain from punishing in many periods where they could do so, even when they themselves have been punished in the recent past. This suggests their primary motive is conditional cooperation enforcement rather than retaliation or venting.\n\nThey show no evidence of using punishment as a strategic “signal” to demand cooperation for their own future benefit (e.g., they do not escalate punishment as they reduce their own contributions later). Once they move into a more self-interested contribution pattern, they essentially stop punishing rather than turning to hypocritical or self-serving sanctions. This aligns with a relatively principled but pragmatic enforcement style: punish when you personally uphold the norm, stop enforcing once the norm erodes and you no longer follow it yourself.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nWhen punished, this player does not clearly retaliate. They are punished multiple times, sometimes while they are fully cooperating and sometimes while they are free-riding, but there is no visible pattern of counter-punishment aimed at prior punishers. Their subsequent punishment decisions continue to focus on low contributors rather than on those who targeted them previously. This indicates a low tendency toward personal vendetta and a relatively impersonal view of punishment (as something about behavior, not identity).\n\nThey also do not clearly “comply” with punishment in the sense of adjusting in the pay-off maximizing direction that punishers might want: at times, they reduce contributions after being punished, and at other times they maintain or return to cooperation despite being hit. Given that they are punished in both cooperative and non-cooperative states, it is difficult for them to extract a clear behavioral rule from others’ sanctions, and their adjustments appear driven more by overall environment assessment than by specific punishers’ messages.\n\nTheir stance toward punishers is best described as detached and tolerant: they absorb punishment as noise in a chaotic environment rather than as a personal signal that must be answered. There is no strong evidence of either long-term grudges or attempts to appease specific players.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThis player pays steady attention to others’ contribution levels and apparent payoff patterns and adapts their own behavior at the aggregate level rather than tracking individuals in detail. Early in the game, seeing that others often contribute less than full but that there is some pattern of sanctioning low contributors, they persist in full contribution and occasionally add mild, norm-aligned punishment. This shows they respond to the perceived presence of some cooperative core and enforcement structure.\n\nAs the game progresses and they observe increasingly large and sometimes self-destructive punishment expenditures, widespread antisocial sanctions, and erratic cooperation, they update toward a more pessimistic view of the group: contributing fully no longer seems tied to better outcomes, and high contributors are not reliably protected. In response, they withdraw from enforcement and transition to keeping their endowment, even when others still contribute substantially. Their later choices suggest they infer that outcomes are driven more by chaotic punishment than by orderly reciprocity, undermining the value of personal cooperation.\n\nThey do not chase the highest individual earners or mimic the behavior of any single apparently successful player. Instead, they respond to the overall pattern: when the group looks relatively ordered and at least somewhat cooperative, they cooperate and occasionally enforce; when the group’s outcomes become dominated by severe punishment and erratic payoffs, they protect themselves by ceasing contributions and not spending on punishment. This pattern suggests a player who is observant, responsive to collective dynamics, and willing to revise from pro-social to self-regarding strategies when cooperation appears unsustainable.", "umap_x": -1.4129183292388916, "umap_y": -1.0414447784423828, "cluster_id": 0, "cluster_size": 40, "cluster_title": "Punishment / Contributions / Contribution", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around punishment, contributions, contribution, norm, cooperation."}
{"experiment": "3sZW8GmBWg97noGXL", "participant": "XBsJwxCtWmKyKZnzg", "game_finished": true, "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a mostly high-contributing conditional cooperator with some opportunistic and spiteful deviations. After initially free-riding, they settle into a pattern of contributing fully in most rounds, even when others increasingly withhold. They continue to contribute in many situations where a purely self-interested or efficiency-focused player would stop, indicating that they value sustaining a norm of contribution or “doing their part” more than strictly maximizing short-term payoff.\n\nTheir contributions are clearly conditional: they do not always contribute. When they withhold, it tends to coincide with environments where others are also withholding or where the contribution structure is unstable. They are willing to return to high contributions after non-cooperative episodes, suggesting they do not fully “give up” on the public good. There is no clear evidence of finely tuned tit-for-tat; instead the player alternates between high-commitment cooperator and frustrated free-rider depending on the perceived social climate.\n\nThey accept substantial personal payoff losses from contributing in low-cooperation environments, which shows low narrow risk aversion and low concern for short-term monetary optimization. Their behavior is compatible with a fairness or norm-based utility: they prefer to act in line with their own standard of contribution and then attempt to regulate others via punishment, rather than adjusting contributions purely to match the group’s average.\n\nOverall, they are a “stubborn norm cooperator”: they lean strongly toward full contribution as their default, deviate into non-contribution in some low-trust situations, but repeatedly revert to cooperation rather than permanently defecting.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThis player is a heavy, sometimes self-destructive punisher with a strong taste for sanctioning, and their punishment pattern is only loosely tied to efficiency or clear reciprocity. For many rounds they choose not to punish at all, but when they do punish, they often spend large amounts relative to their payoff, including cases where punishment drives their own earnings to very low or negative values. That indicates they derive intrinsic value from imposing costs on others or from expressing disapproval, even when it is materially harmful to themselves.\n\nTheir punishment is not narrowly targeted only at low contributors. They sometimes punish in high-cooperation contexts and sometimes punish in ways that are not obviously aligned with social efficiency, suggesting motives that include anger, revenge, or moralistic expression rather than calibrated deterrence. At the same time, they do not punish continuously or mechanically: there are many rounds where they absorb deductions or observe questionable behavior yet choose not to retaliate or sanction. This discontinuity suggests their threshold for punishing is context-dependent and emotional rather than rule-based.\n\nThey show willingness to incur high punishment costs late in the game, which is inconsistent with strategic investment in future cooperation (since future rounds are limited and unknown). This supports an interpretation of punishment as expressive or spiteful rather than purely instrumental. They do not appear to systematically reward high cooperators via leniency; their punishment is more about targeting perceived offenders than about positively reinforcing allies.\n\nIn short, they are a “volatile altruistic/spiteful punisher”: willing to take very large personal costs to hurt or discipline others, but without a consistently transparent or efficiency-minded rule for when and whom to punish.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nThis player frequently receives punishment from others, both when they contribute and when they do not. Their observable responses suggest neither straightforward deterrence nor pure retaliation.\n\nThey do not reliably respond to being punished by shifting to more compliant, safer strategies; after being sanctioned, they are still willing to contribute fully and sometimes also escalate their own use of punishment. Thus, punishment does not consistently cow them into low-visibility, low-impact play. At the same time, they do not engage in clear one-to-one vendettas: there is no clean pattern of “you punished me, I punish you next time” targeting specific counterparts, at least not one that can be unambiguously inferred from aggregate behavior. Their retaliation, if present, is noisy and folded into broader sanctioning of the group.\n\nThey tolerate repeated punishment without withdrawing completely from contribution; instead, they oscillate between cooperative and non-cooperative episodes. This suggests a personality that is resistant to social pressure and willing to stick with self-defined norms, even under direct sanctions. When they do punish after having been punished, the intensity indicates an emotional or pride component—“I won’t be pushed around”—but the targets cannot be clearly mapped to specific punishers from prior rounds based solely on the transcript, so any claim about direct revenge against identifiable individuals is low confidence.\n\nOverall, they are relatively punishment-insensitive in the deterrence sense and potentially revenge-prone in a diffuse way, but not reliably tit-for-tat against specific punishers.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThis player is highly responsive to the broader pattern of others’ contributions, payoffs, and sanctioning, but in a coarse, affect-driven rather than fine-tuned way.\n\nThey appear to infer “climate” from others’ outcomes: when others’ contributions and payouts reveal a relatively cooperative environment, they are willing to keep contributing fully, even when doing so is individually costly relative to free-riding. When they see strong evidence of chaos—heavy mutual punishment, extreme payoffs, and turbulent sanctioning—they are more likely to switch into punishing mode or occasionally into non-contribution, indicating frustration or moral outrage at perceived unfairness or disorder.\n\nThey seem particularly triggered by players who obtain very high payoffs under low contribution or benefit from others’ cooperation while not matching it. In such contexts they expend large punishment resources, even at considerable self-cost, suggesting an aversion to others “getting away with” advantageous outcomes. They also sometimes punish when many others are already engaged in aggressive sanctioning, hinting at a tendency to join or amplify punitive norms once a punishment spiral is underway.\n\nHowever, they do not simply mirror the average: there are cooperative peers they do not bother to “protect” with counter-punishment, and there are defectors they sometimes ignore. Their reactions to others’ outcomes are therefore selective and likely governed by internal, partly emotional evaluations of who “deserves” what, rather than a stable enforcement policy.\n\nIn summary, they track others’ contributions and payoffs and are strongly motivated by perceived unfair advantages and breakdowns of cooperation, using punishment and stubborn contributions to express and enforce their personal norms, even when this sharply lowers their own earnings.", "umap_x": -1.2654913663864136, "umap_y": -1.1507644653320312, "cluster_id": 0, "cluster_size": 40, "cluster_title": "Punishment / Contributions / Contribution", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around punishment, contributions, contribution, norm, cooperation."}

They alternate between full contribution and full defection rather than choosing intermediate levels (which are not available here), and they do not settle into a consistent cooperative or non-cooperative regime.\n\nThey sometimes contribute fully even when others’ average contributions are relatively low, and sometimes free-ride when others are contributing a lot. This indicates weak conditional cooperation: they do not reliably match the group’s behavior, and their own pattern shows no clear upward or downward trend; instead it is volatile and context-insensitive.\n\nThey tolerate substantial inequality in their favor, repeatedly taking high private payoffs while others contribute more. They also occasionally accept very poor personal payoffs when choosing to contribute and punish heavily, suggesting that immediate monetary maximization is not their sole priority.\n\nFairness norms are weak or inconsistent. They show no clear pattern of “if most others contribute, I will too” or “if most defect, I will defect.” Their contribution choices do not consistently reward cooperators or punish defectors through contribution behavior itself.\n\nRisk tolerance appears moderate to high: they are willing to expose themselves to negative or very low round payoffs (especially in combination with heavy punishment) without an observable adaptive correction toward safer, lower-variance strategies.\n\nOverall, they act as a noisy, self-regarding player who occasionally experiments with cooperation but does not anchor on a stable pro-social or purely selfish strategy.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThis player is an unusually heavy and sometimes extreme punisher, with a pattern consistent with antisocial or spiteful punishment rather than norm-enforcing punishment.\n\nThey frequently spend large amounts on punishment, sometimes to the point of driving their own payoff into strongly negative territory. This shows that they are willing to sacrifice considerable personal income purely to reduce others’ payoffs. Such willingness is hard to reconcile with purely instrumental, payoff-maximizing motives; it is more consistent with emotional or expressive motives (e.g., spite, frustration) or with a distorted notion of “justice” that does not track contributions.\n\nTheir targeting is not aligned with standard reciprocal fairness norms. They do not focus their punishment selectively on low contributors or consistent free-riders. In several instances, they punish players who are contributing fully or more than they are. This lack of alignment with contribution levels indicates that punishment is not primarily used to enforce cooperation norms.\n\nThey also do not display a clear deterrence strategy: there is no observable tightening or relaxing of punishment in line with changes in others’ behavior, nor a consistent focus on repeat low contributors. Instead, the pattern looks erratic and high-intensity, with large punishment bursts directed at specific individuals at different times.\n\nSelectivity is low: when they do decide to punish, they sometimes punish multiple players and at high intensity, rather than carefully choosing minimal-cost interventions. Given the cost-benefit ratio of punishment, their choices often reduce their own payoff without producing obvious strategic benefits.\n\nTaken together, their punishment profile suggests a “spiteful / antisocial punisher” type: willing to incur costs to harm others, not reliably linked to contribution norms, and with little evidence of strategic calibration.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nThis player receives punishment on multiple occasions from various others. Their behavioral response does not indicate compliance or accommodation: after being punished, they do not reliably shift toward the punisher’s apparent norm (for example, they do not consistently move from free-riding to contributing, nor from heavy punishment to restraint).\n\nThere is also no clear pattern of targeted retaliation against identifiable punishers. Although punishers are identifiable, the player’s punishment behavior is too broad and erratic to cleanly infer tit-for-tat responses. Sometimes they later punish players who had previously punished them, but they also punish players who did not punish them and fail to punish some past punishers. Because of this inconsistency, any retaliatory motive is at best low-confidence and mixed with other motives.\n\nThey show no visible “forgiveness” dynamic: punishment from others does not lead them to stop punishing those individuals, nor to adopt more cooperative contributions toward them. Instead, their own punishment and contribution patterns continue in a similarly volatile manner regardless of who has sanctioned them.\n\nOverall, they appear relatively insensitive to being punished in terms of strategic adjustment. They neither consistently appease punishers with cooperative behavior nor reliably escalate against them; they continue following their own idiosyncratic pattern.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThis player observes detailed end-of-round outcomes, including others’ payoffs, punishment expenditures, and received deductions, yet their subsequent behavior does not seem systematically guided by these outcomes.\n\nThey do not clearly reward players who sacrifice payoff to enforce cooperation, nor do they consistently ally with, imitate, or avoid heavy punishers. Similarly, they do not preferentially protect high contributors from punishment; they repeatedly allow or participate in environments where cooperators are heavily punished without adjusting their own contribution or punishment strategy to stabilize the group.\n\nThey appear largely unconcerned with the efficiency of group outcomes. They sometimes choose actions (especially heavy punishment combined with contribution) that drive total welfare down and harm themselves, even when others are already incurring large costs. There is no sign that they shift toward more restrained behavior when they see others generating very low or negative payoffs through aggressive punishment, nor that they exploit this chaos in a reliably payoff-maximizing way.\n\nTheir reaction to others’ extreme punishments is thus best characterized as indifferent or opportunistic rather than coordinated or norm-driven. They do not emulate high-earning strategies consistently, nor do they react to others’ misfortunes with protection or restraint. If anything, they sometimes contribute nothing and avoid punishment, letting others bear the cost of chaotic sanctioning while they collect high free-rider payoffs.\n\nIn summary, this player processes others’ outcomes in a way that does not translate into stable reciprocity, coalition-building, or efficiency-seeking.

They usually give the full endowment, but occasionally give nothing even when many others contribute or when they themselves were just punished. Their choices do not track public contributions in a simple conditional‑cooperator pattern; they both contribute fully in mostly low‑contribution environments and free‑ride when many others are contributing. This suggests a mix of a cooperative self‑image with opportunistic deviations rather than a strict fairness rule.\n\nThey do not appear to optimize for immediate monetary payoff: they repeatedly choose the dominated full‑contribution option even when the group is trending low and they have been losing coins to punishment. The intermittent free‑riding looks more like sporadic experimentation or emotional reaction than a systematic profit‑maximizing strategy. Risk tolerance toward potentially being punished for free‑riding is moderate: they free‑ride a few times but overall revert to full contributions rather than sustaining a pure defector strategy.\n\nFairness norms are inconsistent: the player sometimes cooperates in clearly unfair environments and sometimes defects in relatively cooperative ones. This suggests they care about cooperation but do not rigidly tie their own behavior to others’ average contribution; instead they seem driven by internal motives or shifting moods more than by strict reciprocity.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThe player sometimes engages in costly punishment, but not every time others defect, and not in a consistent tit‑for‑tat pattern. They punish in multiple nonadjacent rounds and spend nontrivial amounts when they do, indicating a willingness to incur personal cost to sanction others. However, there are also many situations with salient low contributors where they choose not to punish at all, so they are selective rather than a systematic enforcer.\n\nThe targeting pattern is opaque from the aggregate summaries alone; it is clear only that they do not exclusively punish the worst contributors and they do not always punish those who punished them earlier. This implies motives that mix norm enforcement with occasional expressive or retaliatory elements, but with low confidence on exact triggers. They also punish in late stages when there is little future to influence, which suggests that deterrence is not their sole motive; expressing disapproval or “getting even” likely matters.\n\nThey never use punishment to reward cooperators or to fine‑tune others’ earnings; all punishment is purely subtractive. Combined with their own repeated losses, this indicates they are willing to accept significant personal cost for sanctions, so long as they subjectively perceive a deviation or offense, even if outside observers might see this as inefficient.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nWhen they themselves are punished, they do not display a clear, consistent pattern of retaliation or compliance. After being fined, they sometimes continue to contribute fully, sometimes switch to free‑riding, and sometimes also begin or increase their own punishment of others. They do not systematically target all who punished them; there is no clear one‑for‑one retaliation against every punisher. This suggests that while they may occasionally react to being targeted, they are not narrowly vindictive.\n\nThey also do not reliably “reward” punishment by conforming to a cooperator norm after being sanctioned. At times they maintain high contributions despite repeated deductions, which may reflect a stubborn adherence to their own preferred behavior rather than obedience to external pressure. At other times they defect after being punished, which could signal frustration or disengagement rather than learning.\n\nOverall, their response to punishers is best characterized as noisy and internally driven: they neither meekly comply with sanctions nor systematically strike back. Whether they interpret punishment as informative, hostile, or arbitrary is unknown; their mixed behavioral adjustments imply that they do not construct a stable model of specific punishers over the course of the game.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThe player observes others’ payoffs and punishment patterns but reacts in a complex, nonmonotonic way. They sometimes respond to widespread low contributions and heavy sanctioning by continuing to cooperate, absorbing personal losses while others fight; at other times, in similarly conflictual environments, they free‑ride. This suggests they do not anchor strongly on group payoff efficiency, nor do they purely imitate the financially successful: they occasionally adopt the payoff‑dominated cooperative action, and occasionally exploit cooperative groups.\n\nThey appear somewhat sensitive to extreme behavior: when some players spend very large amounts punishing or are heavily punished, the focal player is more likely to use punishment themselves, though not predictably against those specific high‑spenders. This points to an awareness that the social environment is tense or norm‑contested, and a willingness to participate in that contest even at a loss.\n\nThere is no stable tendency to align with the “majority strategy”: they contribute fully when others are split or mostly defecting and also defect when others are mostly cooperating. Likewise, players who obtain very high or very low payoffs are not treated in a consistently favorable or hostile way. This indicates that the focal player tracks others’ outcomes but does not use a simple rule like “punish the richest” or “punish those hurting the group most.”\n\nIn sum, this player behaves like a conflicted cooperator: they value contributing and occasionally enforcing norms, yet alternate between principled cooperation, opportunistic defection, and sporadic costly punishment without a clearly stable, payoff‑based rule.

Their behavior suggests weak or unstable internal fairness norms: they sometimes join high-contribution profiles, but they are comfortable free-riding on others’ generosity and do not systematically match or reciprocate the group’s average behavior. They appear relatively insensitive to the efficiency logic of the public good, as they repeatedly choose patterns that sacrifice their own round payoffs through heavy punishment rather than stabilize a high-contribution equilibrium. Overall, they behave more like a tactician in a conflict than like a welfare- or fairness-maximizer within the public good.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThis player is a very heavy, aggressive user of punishment, often spending a large share of their available payoff to reduce others’ earnings. They are not narrowly targeting clear free-riders; instead they frequently punish multiple peers heavily, including those who are contributing at or near the group norm. Their punishment is not tightly aligned with contribution levels or with maximizing future gains; it often looks like broad, hostile sanctioning or “control” of others rather than calibrated norm enforcement. They do not show clear evidence of using minimal, cost-effective punishment for deterrence; instead, they regularly overspend on sanctions, sometimes driving their own payoff very low or negative. The pattern is consistent with a willingness to incur substantial personal cost to hurt or dominate others, even when that does not appear instrumentally rational. There is also no consistent pattern of them easing up on targets after those targets change behavior, suggesting low responsiveness to deterrence feedback and a greater role for emotional or retributive motives than for strategic norm-building.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nWhen they are punished, this player does not reliably respond with appeasement or clear compliance. They continue to mix cooperative and uncooperative contributions after being sanctioned and often maintain or even escalate their own use of punishment. There is no obvious evidence that they selectively retaliate against specific identifiable punishers; their punishment is too diffuse and widespread to confidently infer targeted revenge. Instead, their reaction to being punished appears to be: (a) persistence in their own strategic flexibility on contributions, and (b) continued or intensified willingness to punish others broadly. This suggests a low tendency toward forgiveness and a low tendency to “submit” to others’ sanctioning; they do not appear to internalize others’ punishment as a cue to conform, but rather continue following their own aggressive pattern. Whether they consciously track who punished them is unknown; at best, any retaliation is indirect or submerged within generally hostile sanctioning.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThis player closely uses the punishment stage to respond to how others are doing, but not in a way that clearly supports reciprocity or joint welfare. They frequently direct punishment toward players who earn high payoffs or who avoid punishment themselves, regardless of those players’ contribution levels, suggesting some mix of outcome-based envy, competitive leveling, or aversion to others getting ahead. They do not reward high contributors by protecting them from punishment; instead, they sometimes attack high earners even when those players cooperate. Conversely, they sometimes refrain from punishing low contributors, and at other times include them in broader sanctioning, indicating that others’ payoffs and conflict dynamics matter more than a clean contribution norm. They also do not appear to condition strongly on others’ own punishment costs (for example, punishing those who punish a lot, or sparing those who self-sacrifice); any such pattern is weak or inconsistent.

They consistently favor taking the full private endowment when others are contributing, and they never appear to follow a stable reciprocity rule. They sometimes contribute fully despite others contributing less, and at other times they free-ride while most others cooperate, suggesting low concern for fairness norms and low sensitivity to conditional cooperation cues. Their pattern does not clearly track recent punishment, payoff level, or average group contribution; instead, their choices alternate between full contribution and zero in a way that appears weakly strategic at best and often myopic. They show no clear risk-averse attempt to avoid being singled out as a defector—on the contrary, they repeatedly remain the sole or one of very few non-contributors in highly cooperative profiles. Overall, they behave as a mostly selfish, unstable contributor who occasionally cooperates but does not uphold any consistent fairness or reciprocity standard.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThis player almost never uses the punishment option and spends nothing on it in the great majority of rounds. When they do punish, they spend a large amount in one instance, despite not being a strong cooperator themselves. This rare, high-intensity use is not clearly targeted to enforce cooperation in any consistent way, as they do not follow it with a stable cooperative pattern themselves, nor do they establish any ongoing sanctioning role. There is no visible pattern of selectively punishing clear free-riders while sparing cooperators, and their overwhelming default is to abstain from punishment entirely. This suggests a type that is generally unwilling to incur personal cost to enforce norms, with a possible one-off spike of punitive behavior whose motive is ambiguous (could be frustration, retaliation, or a noisy attempt at norm enforcement; confidence low). They do not appear to use punishment systematically as a deterrent tool.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nThis player is repeatedly punished across the game, often when they free-ride while others contribute more. Despite this, they do not reliably “comply” by switching into sustained cooperation after being punished. Sometimes they contribute fully after having been punished; at other times they continue to free-ride even after receiving substantial deductions. There is no clear one-to-one retaliatory pattern against specific punishers: when they finally do invest heavily in punishment, the target pattern is not obviously tied to a single prior punisher, and they do not become a persistent counter-punisher. Overall, they show low responsiveness to sanctions in terms of long-term behavioral change and do not clearly adopt either a forgiving (shift to cooperation) or a vengeful (systematic retaliation) stance. Their response to being punished appears inconsistent and weakly strategic, with no stable compliance rule.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThis player observes others repeatedly spending heavily to punish and sometimes driving their own or others’ payoffs very low, yet they continue to pursue primarily self-interested contributions and rarely join the enforcement efforts. High costs borne by others for norm enforcement do not lead them to adopt those same norms or to emulate that role. They also do not seem to reward cooperators indirectly (e.g., by aligning their contributions with cooperative clusters); instead, they often free-ride exactly when others are most cooperative. They do not systematically avoid punishing those who are already heavily penalized, nor do they visibly “protect” victims of severe punishment; in practice, they mostly remain a bystander. Group-level payoff patterns—such as the presence of very high contributors who get attacked, or chaotic punishment cascades—do not induce them to shift into a stabilizing or coordinating role.

They alternate repeatedly between giving everything and giving nothing, rather than using intermediate levels (which are unavailable), and this switching does not settle into a clear pattern of “always cooperate after X” or “always defect after Y.” They sometimes contribute even when others contribute less than them, and sometimes free-ride on many high contributors, suggesting that short-term payoff maximization is important but not applied consistently or mechanically. They tolerate personal losses in some cooperative choices, so they are not purely payoff-maximizing in a narrow, round-by-round sense. There is no clear fairness norm: they are willing to contribute while many others do not, and equally willing to take the full endowment while others contribute heavily. Their behavior indicates experimental and reactive decision-making, likely driven by recent mood about group conflict and punishment rather than a stable pro- or anti-cooperation principle. Risk tolerance appears moderate: they sometimes expose themselves to being a lone high contributor and sometimes to being an obvious free-rider; both choices are accepted without visible adjustment aimed at avoiding being targeted.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThe player is an active, costly punisher who sometimes spends heavily, accepting very low or even negative net payoffs in those rounds. They target multiple peers in some instances and are willing to forgo substantial income to impose deductions, consistent with strong emotional or norm-enforcing motives rather than pure efficiency. However, their punishment is not consistently aligned with a clear cooperation norm: they punish both low and high contributors at different times, and at other times they abstain from punishing in situations where a strict norm-enforcer would be expected to act. Their choices appear more like episodic outbursts when they feel wronged or see extreme behavior, not a steady “punish all defectors” rule. This makes deterrence-based motives uncertain; if deterrence is a goal, it is executed inconsistently, likely limiting its effectiveness. Retaliatory or expressive motives are more plausible: when they choose to punish, they are willing to pay substantial costs to do so, suggesting that expressing disapproval or venting frustration is at least as important as changing others’ future contributions. Selectivity is therefore low in principle (they are willing to punish broadly) but in practice fluctuates round to round, implying that their threshold for acting depends on recent interactions and the overall conflict climate rather than a stable rule.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nWhen punished, the player does not display a clear, consistent shift toward either appeasement or counter-retaliation. They sometimes continue to free-ride after being punished and sometimes continue to cooperate after being targeted, indicating that punishment does not reliably induce compliance. There is no systematic pattern of punishing specific prior punishers in the following round, so directed revenge against identifiable punishers is at most sporadic and cannot be cleanly inferred. Likewise, there is no clear pattern of switching to stable high contributions to avoid further sanctions. Their response is best described as emotionally resilient or indifferent at the strategic level: they absorb punishment, occasionally adjust contributions, but not in a way that clearly signals “I comply to avoid costs” or “I retaliate against you.” Forgiveness vs. resentment is unknown; the observable actions do not cleanly map to one or the other.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThe player appears sensitive to the overall conflict and payoff landscape rather than to specific individual outcomes. They continue to play and sometimes cooperate even as other players burn large amounts of coins on punishment and drive their own and others’ payoffs very low, which suggests a tolerance for chaotic or hostile environments and an interest in remaining engaged rather than withdrawing or purely exploiting. They do not systematically align with “victims” or “aggressors”: they sometimes join the general punitive atmosphere and sometimes sit out of punishment even when others are being heavily targeted. They observe that some players repeatedly spend extreme amounts on punishment and that some end up with strongly negative or very low round payoffs, yet this does not push them into a consistent stabilizing or exploitative role. Instead, they oscillate: sometimes joining the sanctioning crowd, sometimes quietly taking advantage of high contributions by others. Overall, they react to others’ outcomes in a way that indicates curiosity and situational experimentation rather than a fixed empathy norm or a strict payoff-comparison rule.

They are clearly willing to contribute the maximum when many others also contribute and when the environment does not feel hostile, but they also repeatedly choose to free-ride after experiencing being targeted by punishment. The shifts between contributing and not contributing do not follow a simple monotonic trend; instead, they appear contingent on recent treatment by others and the perceived fairness of the group, rather than on optimizing expected monetary payoff. They do not appear to condition their contribution strongly on specific individuals’ behavior (for example, they sometimes contribute even when several others free-ride, and they sometimes free-ride when several others contribute). This suggests that their primary reference point is the overall climate of hostility or safety, not fine-grained reciprocity. Their intermittently cooperative choices, despite low marginal returns to the public good and frequent victimization, indicate that they are not purely payoff-maximizing; they are willing to incur significant personal cost to uphold a cooperative pattern when they feel it is viable. At the same time, their repeated switches back to free-riding after being punished indicate a readiness to abandon cooperation when they feel exploited, implying a conditional, emotionally reactive cooperator rather than a stable altruist.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThis player is a relatively low-frequency punisher but, when they do punish, they use it intensely and at high personal cost. They do not appear to engage in systematic sanctioning of all low contributors; instead, their punishment is highly selective and clustered in a few episodes. Those episodes tend to occur after they have cooperated and been subjected to what is likely perceived as unfair or hostile treatment, suggesting that retaliation and norm-enforcement motives are intertwined. They are willing to sacrifice a large share of their earnings in one burst of punishment, which is inconsistent with narrow monetary self-interest and points to strong negative reciprocity or anger. There is no clear evidence that they are trying to use punishment as a calibrated deterrent (for example, they do not consistently target the worst free-riders across the game, and they do not maintain a steady, proportional sanctioning pattern). Instead, punishment appears episodic and emotionally driven: they mostly refrain from punishing, tolerate a hostile environment for many rounds, then at one point spend heavily in a way that harms others more than it benefits them. After these large punishment expenditures, they revert to non-punishing behavior even when they themselves continue to be targeted, suggesting that they do not maintain long-run vendettas and may quickly exhaust or set aside retaliatory impulses once expressed. Overall, they behave like a grudging retaliator rather than a systematic norm enforcer or a strategic punisher.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nThis player is punished in many rounds, often despite contributing fully or more than some peers, and appears to interpret such punishment as illegitimate or hostile. They do not visibly “comply” with punishers by increasing contributions afterward; in fact, repeated punishment is followed by phases of free-riding and, at one point, intense counter-punishment. This indicates that being punished does not induce them to align with any perceived norm; instead, it undermines their willingness to cooperate and increases their readiness to retaliate. However, the retaliation is not targeted in a clear, one-to-one way at specific named punishers—at least not in a pattern that can be reliably inferred from the transcript. This makes their response more consistent with diffuse revenge against the group climate rather than precise tit-for-tat. After expressing retaliation through costly punishment, they do not persist in punishing the same environment in subsequent rounds even though they keep receiving sanctions; this suggests that their anger response is acute rather than chronic, that they are capable of “moving on” behaviorally even if they do not return to stable cooperation. They never show a pattern of “forgiving through compliance” (i.e., adapting contributions upward to avoid further punishment), so their type resists coercion and does not reward aggressors with greater cooperation.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThis player closely observes others’ contributions and the punishment structure, and appears sensitive to the collective payoff environment, but they do not track or match individual payoffs in a fine-grained way. They are willing to continue cooperating even while seeing some others gain from free-riding and from aggressive punishment use, which implies tolerance for unequal outcomes up to a point. However, when the environment becomes heavily punitive and others spend large amounts on harming each other, the player’s behavior shifts: they free-ride more and, in one episode, engage in very costly punishment themselves. This pattern suggests that high visible hostility and destruction of payoffs by others reduces their commitment to the public good and triggers a desire to impose losses back on the group, even at a net cost to themselves. There is no evidence that they try to align with the high-earning strategies in order to imitate success; instead, they pursue a personally meaningful notion of fairness or dignity, sometimes accepting lower payoffs rather than conforming to the most profitable but hostile patterns. They seem particularly affected by seeing cooperative players punished or by being punished themselves despite cooperative behavior, which likely leads them to infer that others are not trustworthy partners in sustaining fairness. Thus, their responses to others’ outcomes are driven more by perceived justice and aggression levels than by pure payoff comparisons or envy.", "umap_x": -1.5651251077651978, "umap_y": -1.0778789520263672, "cluster_id": 0, "cluster_size": 40, "cluster_title": "Punishment / Contributions / Contribution", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around punishment, contributions, contribution, norm, cooperation."}

Their baseline is to keep their entire endowment and live off others’ contributions, even when most others contribute. They only ever use the extreme options available (all or nothing) and show no gradual adjustment, suggesting simple heuristic play rather than fine-tuned optimization. Full contributions appear sporadically and do not persist even when others also contribute a lot, indicating that they do not strongly internalize a cooperative norm or aim for stable reciprocity. They tolerate benefiting from others’ generosity without matching it and do not appear concerned with aligning their behavior to group averages. Their risk tolerance regarding cooperation is low: when in doubt, they default to defection and prioritize immediate personal payoff over potential collective gain. Any cooperative moves seem exploratory or context-reactive rather than part of a sustained fairness norm. Their fairness preferences are weak or inconsistent: they sometimes join high-contribution environments but do not maintain that stance when it would require sacrificing their own payoff repeatedly.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey make relatively infrequent use of punishment and, when they do punish, it is light and isolated rather than part of a systematic enforcement strategy. There is no clear pattern of punishing low contributors versus high contributors; their punishment choices do not obviously track cooperative norms, defectors, or extreme punishers. They do not appear to engage in costly norm enforcement aimed at stabilizing cooperation, nor do they join group-wide punishment cascades. Their spending on punishment is modest overall, consistent with a preference to preserve their own payoffs rather than invest heavily in shaping others’ behavior. Motivationally, the limited and sporadic punishment suggests either mild expressive reactions (e.g., annoyance at being targeted or at seeming unfairness) or experimentation with the mechanism rather than deliberate deterrence. They are not vengeful in any obvious, sustained way and do not escalate punishment in response to others’ aggression. Selectivity and targeting rules are unclear (low-confidence: unknown); there is no strong evidence they systematically reward cooperators or sanction free-riders via punishment choices.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nThey experience substantial punishment across the game but do not clearly retaliate against specific identified punishers, nor do they shift toward stable cooperation to appease them. When punished, their subsequent contributions generally remain low or revert to defection after brief cooperative excursions, suggesting limited compliance with punitive pressure. There is no consistent pattern of “hit back at whoever punished me” visible; their rare uses of punishment do not line up clearly with those who previously targeted them, at least at the coarse resolution available here. This indicates a relatively low retaliatory drive, or at least low willingness to spend on revenge. At the same time, they also do not respond with durable “forgiveness-and-cooperation” after being sanctioned; their cooperative switches are temporary and do not map cleanly onto punishments received, so any appeasement motive is weak or absent.

When they see that free riders earn more than contributors in the shared environment, they are willing to adopt the same payoff-maximizing stance themselves, even if they have previously cooperated.

This points to a payoff-responsive, conditional style rather than principled adherence to either pure altruism or pure self-interest.\n\nRisk tolerance appears moderate: they are comfortable taking the “risk” of cooperating in a social environment that includes visible free riders, but they also mitigate that risk by intermittently defecting. Their willingness to cooperate even when some others do not suggests they are not purely pessimistic about others’ behavior, yet their willingness to defect after observing payoff differences shows they are alert to being exploited and will adjust accordingly.\n\nIn fairness terms, they do not enforce or follow a strict equality norm; they are willing both to be the one who earns less than free riders (by cooperating in mixed groups) and to be the one who earns more (by free riding when others contribute). This asymmetry suggests that securing acceptable personal outcomes is more central than maintaining symmetric fairness across players.\n\nOverall, the player can be characterized as a flexible, payoff-aware conditional cooperator who alternates between pro-social and self-interested choices, adapting to observed incentive patterns rather than committing to a stable cooperative identity.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThe player clearly attends to others’ outcomes, at least implicitly, as shown by their behavior aligning with changes in the payoff structure between contributors and non-contributors.

This points to a mixed-motive orientation: they value both the public good and personal gain, without committing fully to either.\n\nThey appear comfortable with payoff risk: they sometimes choose the dominated action from an individual-income perspective (full contribution) despite having already experienced that defectors can earn more when others are cooperative.

They do not mix strategies within a round; they choose the extreme options available. Their behavior indicates conditional cooperation: they are willing to contribute when many others do, but they become a free rider after seeing ongoing non-contribution that goes unaddressed. They appear sensitive to fairness and reciprocity; when cooperators and defectors coexist and defectors are not penalized, they abandon cooperation and instead take advantage of the contributions of others. Once they switch to non-contribution, they maintain that stance, suggesting a threshold-based or “once burned, defect” rule rather than continuous fine-tuning. They demonstrate basic payoff-maximizing reasoning: they notice that non-contributors can earn higher payoffs when others keep contributing, and they are willing to act on this, even if it reduces the group’s overall efficiency. Their risk tolerance is moderate: they initially risk being exploited by free riders to test or support cooperation, but once exploitation proves stable, they avoid further personal sacrifice for the public good. Their cooperation is thus contingent on a social environment that appears sufficiently cooperative and not overly tolerant of free riding; in an environment lacking enforcement mechanisms, they ultimately prioritize self-interest over maintaining high contributions.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThe player closely tracks how outcomes differ between contributors and non-contributors and adjusts behavior in response. When free riders obtain higher payoffs than contributors and are not sanctioned, the player aligns with the better-paid group rather than continuing to accept a relative disadvantage. They are responsive to payoff asymmetries: seeing non-contributors systematically earn more while still benefiting from others’ contributions leads them to join that strategy. There is no opportunity here for direct punishment or reward, so their “response” is entirely via changing their own contribution pattern. They do not attempt to “lead by example” once it becomes clear that some peers persistently free ride and still do well. Instead, they strategically exploit others’ continued cooperation, accepting that this may reduce total group returns but increases their own. Their reaction suggests they believe others will, at least for some time, keep contributing even if they themselves defect, and they are willing to capitalize on that belief.

They do not adjust their contribution in response to others’ partial or zero contributions; there is no observable conditional cooperation or retaliation.

They do not attempt to “discipline” freeriders via self‑protective defection, nor do they try to “signal” disapproval by changing their contribution; instead, they hold their cooperative pattern constant.

They almost always give the full endowment, with a single very small deviation, and maintain this pattern even when others free-ride heavily and returns are clearly low. Their strategy is essentially unconditional: they do not scale contributions up or down in response to others’ behavior, to group averages, or to being rewarded. They appear to adopt a norm of “always contribute (near) maximum” and stick to it regardless of short‑term payoff disadvantages.\n\nThey show little sensitivity to the marginal per-capita return being below 1 for the individual; once they understand that the multiplier is lower than first thought, they still keep contributing maximally. This suggests either a strong intrinsic preference for cooperation, a rule-based strategy chosen at the start (and not revised), or low attention to payoff optimization. They tolerate persistent exploitation: even when they and one or two others carry the group while others repeatedly give nothing or very little, they continue to cooperate at the same high level. There is no sign that they are enforcing fairness through their own contribution decisions; instead, they absorb unfairness and keep following their cooperative rule.\n\nOverall, their type is best characterized as a “principled unconditional cooperator”: contribution behavior is stable, non-conditional on others, and robust to disappointment and end-game proximity.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nTheir communication style is brief and low-volume but cooperative. They greet the group at the start, endorse a high-contribution strategy proposed by another player, and explicitly agree to a collective plan of maximal giving. Later, after discovering that the return factor is lower than initially believed, they make a short, resigned remark but do not attempt to renegotiate the strategy or argue for changing course.\n\nThey engage with others’ ideas rather than initiating their own elaborate schemes; they respond with concise affirmations and encouragement rather than detailed persuasion. Once it becomes clear that some players are not sticking to the high-contribution plan, they do not confront, criticize, or try to re-coordinate; they simply fall silent regarding strategy and continue playing their way. This indicates a cooperative but non-confrontational, low-conflict personality, with a tendency to accept others’ choices and avoid escalating social tension.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThey show no visible end-game defection or decay in cooperation. Their contributions remain at or near maximum through the final rounds, unaffected by the shrinking horizon. There is a tiny, isolated deviation from full contribution late in the game, but they immediately revert to full giving and do not move toward self-serving behavior as the final round approaches.\n\nThey do not appear to leverage the knowledge of how many rounds remain in a strategic way. The absence of any ramp-down—even after repeated evidence that many group members are not reliably reciprocating—suggests either that they prioritize a stable cooperative identity over last-round exploitation, or that they are not modelling the strategic implications of the end of the game in a payoff-maximizing way. In practice, their “type” is time-invariant: early-, mid-, and late-game behavior look essentially the same.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey never spend any resources to reward others, despite repeatedly encountering high contributors and even receiving rewards themselves in some rounds. Their baseline choice is to refrain from using the reward mechanism entirely. This is not because they are being ignored by others; they do get rewarded in several instances, but they do not reciprocate or adopt a rewarding strategy afterward.\n\nGiven this, their cooperative stance is not complemented by active incentive-setting or gratitude signaling. They seem to separate contribution from reward behavior: they contribute heavily but do not invest in reinforcing others’ contributions, even when rewarding would plausibly support high-cooperation episodes or reciprocate kindness. The absence of any reward use suggests either that they see reward as an unnecessary or unprofitable expenditure, or that they are focused on their own contribution rule and pay relatively little attention to the additional strategic lever that rewards provide.

For most of the game, they reliably give the full endowment to the public good, even when others contribute much less and their own payoffs drop. This indicates a strong cooperative norm and willingness to incur personal cost to maintain group efficiency, despite the low marginal per-capita return. Their contribution pattern is initially stable and unconditional: they continue to cooperate through both high- and low-cooperation environments without visibly adjusting to others’ deviations. Only after a long history of over-contributing relative to many peers do they temporarily reduce contributions to low levels, then return to full contributions. This suggests they care about fairness and are capable of strategic adjustment but are strongly biased toward cooperation as their baseline. The brief low-contribution period appears reactive to sustained under-provision rather than pre-planned exploitation; they do not systematically exploit late rounds and quickly revert to full giving, including at the very end of the game. They tolerate repeated disadvantage for the sake of public good provision, indicating low risk aversion with respect to being the “sucker” and a high intrinsic or norm-based valuation of cooperation.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nTheir communication is minimal, agreeable, and responsive rather than initiating. They engage only a few times, and each time they align with others’ cooperative suggestions with brief affirmations, rather than proposing their own schemes or confronting low contributors. There is no evidence of criticism, blame, or attempts to shame freeriders; conflict-avoidance is strong. They neither push for nor design elaborate coordination plans, instead signaling support when others suggest full cooperation. Their tone is friendly and non-demanding, and they do not try to leverage chat to negotiate rewards or reciprocity. Overall, they present as a quietly prosocial follower in discussion: receptive to cooperative norms and willing to endorse them, but not inclined to lead, argue, or police.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThere is no clear end-game unraveling in their contribution behavior. They continue to give fully up to and including the final round after briefly experimenting with lower contributions earlier. Their reward behavior near the end remains active in some rounds and zero in others, without a clear pattern of either hoarding or “last-period generosity”; thus any specific end-game strategy is unknown. They do not reference the remaining number of rounds in chat, and there is no visible shift that clearly tracks horizon awareness. Overall, they act as if their cooperative norm is time-invariant, with only limited, temporary deviations not specifically tied to the game approaching its conclusion.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey make substantial use of the reward mechanism, repeatedly spending significant amounts of their own payoff to reward others, and never receiving visible rewards themselves. They are willing to sacrifice a large share of their earnings in some rounds to transfer value to peers, indicating strong prosocial motivation that is not obviously conditional on personal gain. Rewarding tends to occur in environments where others are contributing relatively well, suggesting they use rewards as positive reinforcement for cooperative behavior rather than as random gifts. They do not employ reward as a precise, contingent strategy publicly (no messages about “I will reward if you contribute”), so any detailed targeting rules are unknown, but the magnitude and recurrence of their spending show they prioritize encouraging cooperation even at substantial cost. They never use reward vindictively or to balance past inequities; instead, they tolerate being comparatively unrewarded while continuing to allocate rewards to others.", "umap_x": 0.864176332950592, "umap_y": 0.7474355101585388, "cluster_id": 5, "cluster_size": 37, "cluster_title": "Reward / Cooperation / Contribution", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around reward, cooperation, contribution, free, contributions."}

They understand early that contributing is individually costly given the low multiplier and generally aim to maximize their own payoff, not group efficiency. They alternate between zero, low, and occasional high contributions rather than following a stable rule, suggesting responsive but self-centered adaptation rather than a principled norm.\n\nThey clearly free-ride in many situations where others contribute heavily, keeping their entire endowment while still benefiting from the group pot. They also show that they are willing to contribute substantially when it seems psychologically or strategically salient (for instance, when others are all in, or after a period of freeriding), but this is not sustained. The pattern suggests they are not purely selfish automatons: they sometimes join cooperative surges or give a moderate amount when the group is moderately cooperative. However, they never lock into consistent high contributions, and quickly revert to low or zero when they can still benefit from others’ efforts.\n\nConditionality is present but weakly pro-social. They contribute positive amounts more often when others are generally high contributors, and they are willing to jump to a large or very large contribution when everyone else also appears fully cooperative. At the same time, they repeatedly free-ride on a deeply cooperative core of other players, showing low concern for proportionality or fairness in the long run. They do not attempt to “match” others’ average contributions; they are comfortable contributing significantly less than the group while still accepting the benefits.\n\nRisk tolerance appears moderate. They occasionally “risk” a full or large contribution into a highly cooperative environment, but otherwise they stick to safer, individually favorable choices. They do not experiment much with intermediate patterns to test group reactions; rather, they respond in a coarse way: all-in sometimes, small token contributions sometimes, and zero in many rounds. Their decisions suggest that the dominant motive is exploiting cooperative structure for personal gain, tempered by occasional bursts of conformity or maybe mild guilt, but with no sustained fairness-based strategy.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThe player does not send any chat messages. They remain completely silent throughout, even when others actively discuss strategies, propose coordination, or react to the payoff structure. This silence suggests an avoidant or disengaged communication style in this context: they do not attempt to lead, negotiate, reassure, or express frustration or gratitude verbally.\n\nBecause they never speak, there is no direct evidence of their tone, persuasive ability, or explicit beliefs about the game. All inferred adaptation must come from their numerical behavior. Their silence may reflect either low interest in social signaling, a preference for anonymity and non-engagement, or simply passivity in chat. They also do not explicitly confirm or reject cooperative plans in words, allowing them to benefit from others’ coordination attempts without making verbal commitments.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThe player shows only a weak and inconsistent end-game effect. They do not systematically ramp up to maximal free-riding at the end, nor do they mount a final cooperative push. Instead, their late behavior continues the earlier opportunistic mix: some zero contributions and some small positive ones, with one late larger contribution interspersed among freeriding choices.\n\nThey clearly see that the game has a finite horizon, but they do not exploit the final rounds with an extreme shift in either direction. This suggests that for them, the horizon information is not the main driver; rather, they maintain their general pattern: contribute when it feels situationally appropriate but otherwise free-ride. Any end-game decay in cooperation is modest and partially masked by their pre-existing tendency to contribute less than others.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey never spend any of their own coins on rewarding others, even when they personally receive rewards and even when others exhibit very high cooperative behavior. This consistent non-use of the reward mechanism indicates a strong reluctance to pay personal costs for social enforcement or gratitude. They behave as a pure reward free-rider: they accept incoming rewards but do not reciprocate or support the cooperative norm with their own reward spending.\n\nThere is no evidence that their contribution levels increase in response to being rewarded; when they receive rewards, their subsequent contributions do not consistently rise or stay high. This suggests that they interpret rewards primarily as windfall gains rather than as signals that they should cooperate more. Their behavior is best modeled as: reward does not alter their strategic calculus; they ignore the norm-enforcement function and simply pocket the benefit.\n\nOverall, this player treats the reward mechanism as individually irrelevant for their own behavior: they do not use it to shape others, and they do not let it shape them.", "umap_x": 0.688576340675354, "umap_y": 0.904281735420227, "cluster_id": 5, "cluster_size": 37, "cluster_title": "Reward / Cooperation / Contribution", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around reward, cooperation, contribution, free, contributions."}

They begin by contributing at moderate levels, then advocate for full contributions, indicating an initial willingness to explore high-cooperation outcomes. Once they realize the marginal per-coin return from the public good is low relative to keeping coins, they sharply cut their own contributions and subsequently oscillate between very low, zero, and occasional medium/high contributions.\n\nTheir behavior is clearly conditional on perceived payoff structure rather than on fairness norms. When they believe contributions might “go crazy” in payoff, they are willing to suggest and sometimes follow high contributions. After understanding the true (modest) multiplier, they increasingly prioritize their private payoff, even when others persist in high contributions. They do not appear to adopt a strong reciprocity norm: they continue to free-ride even in environments where nearly everyone else fully contributes, and they do not systematically “match” others’ generosity.\n\nThey show some volatility: instead of a smooth decline, they mix in occasional medium or high contributions amidst long stretches of very low or zero contributions. This suggests ongoing small tests of the environment or momentary shifts in attitude rather than a fixed rule. However, the overarching trajectory is clear: they move from exploratory cooperation to predominantly low contribution, with sporadic exceptions that do not build into a stable cooperative strategy.\n\nRisk tolerance appears moderate and instrumental. They are willing to risk higher contributions early when they misperceive the payoff as potentially very high, but once they see that the social return is limited, they avoid further sustained “risky” cooperation. Their fairness concern toward others’ payoffs is weak or absent in revealed behavior: they are comfortable benefiting from others’ consistent high contributions without matching them.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThis player is talkative at the start and tries to coordinate a group strategy around maximal contribution. Their tone is casual, upbeat, and somewhat excitable. They frame cooperation in terms of potentially large mutual payoffs and explicitly attempt to mobilize the group to all contribute their full endowment. They express mild skepticism that everyone will actually follow through, indicating an early belief that some players are likely to free-ride, but they still attempt coordination.\n\nThey actively engage with others’ messages, responding to encouragement from cooperative partners and seeking confirmation about what the “best way” to play is. Their questions and comments show curiosity and a learning orientation: they ask if full contribution is optimal and later explicitly note their mistaken expectation about the payoff structure. Once they realize the multiplier is modest, their chat activity drops off; they do not continue to advocate for cooperation or to negotiate alternative norms. This withdrawal suggests that their engagement is contingent on seeing a strong upside to collective cooperation.\n\nThe player does not use communication to sanction or shame low contributors, nor to praise high contributors. Their persuasion attempts are limited to early positive appeals about potential gains, rather than moral arguments about fairness. After they update their beliefs about the payoff structure, they do not re-open discussion or propose compensating mechanisms, and they become effectively silent in the social channel. This is consistent with a pragmatic, payoff-focused communicator who engages mainly when coordination looks personally beneficial.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThe player shows no clear attempt to sustain or ramp up cooperation as the game approaches its final rounds. Instead, their contributions in later rounds are predominantly zero or very low, punctuated by occasional small or moderate amounts. There is no visible end-game “last burst” of altruism; the pattern is more consistent with continuing, or even hardening, a low-contribution, payoff-maximizing stance.\n\nThey have full awareness that the game has a finite horizon, but they do not appear to time any special strategy to the final period. Their late-game behavior looks like a continuation of the mid-game equilibrium they have settled into: they treat the game as a series of opportunities to retain their endowment while others contribute. If anything, their low contributions late suggest standard backward-induction reasoning or at least intuitive end-game defection: with no future for reputation or reciprocity, they see little reason to increase contributions.\n\nIn terms of beliefs, it is plausible (but not certain) that they expect others to continue contributing near their existing levels even late in the game, and they exploit this by maintaining low personal contributions. There is no evidence that they attempt to reward or “thank” others at the end, nor that they adopt a symbolic cooperative gesture in the final round.\n\n<REWARD>\nThis player never uses the reward mechanism, despite rarely, if ever, being in a position where others’ behavior would not qualify as rewardable under a cooperative norm. They receive rewards in some rounds, which signals that at least one other group member is willing to pay to encourage or recognize contributions, but they do not reciprocate this behavior toward anyone.\n\nTheir revealed stance is that paying 1 coin to give 1 coin provides no strategic or emotional benefit worth the cost. They do not use rewards either to reinforce high contributors or to try to shape future group behavior. This is consistent with a strictly payoff-maximizing evaluation of the reward mechanism: since giving 1 to transfer 1 is neutral in material terms and unlinked to identifiable partners, they see no reason to engage.\n\nThere is no indication of gratitude signaling: they do not publicly acknowledge having been rewarded, nor do they adjust their contributions in response in any stable way. Their non-use of reward persists even in rounds where the group achieves near-full or full contributions.

They rarely choose extremes and instead hover around low-to-middle contributions, occasionally going high when group cooperation is strong and clearly beneficial. They do not blindly free-ride, but they consistently give less than the most cooperative peers.\n\nTheir contributions are conditional on observed group behavior and payoff structure. When others contribute very high amounts, they sometimes increase their own contribution, yet still keep it below the group’s top contributors, indicating a tendency to ride on others’ cooperation while avoiding appearing as a pure defector. When others sharply reduce contributions or a subset of players consistently gives little or nothing, they are willing to drop to very low or zero contributions, showing responsiveness to perceived unfairness and unwillingness to be the “sucker.”\n\nContribution levels show limited volatility: they fluctuate within a relatively narrow band rather than oscillating wildly. This suggests a stable heuristic rather than experimentation each round. They seem to recognize that the marginal per-coin return from the public good is below 1 and behave in a way that balances own-payoff maximization with some willingness to contribute when others are doing so.\n\nThey do not appear committed to strict fairness norms such as matching the highest contributor or insisting on equal contributions; instead, their implicit norm is “contribute some when others do, but protect my own payoff first.” Risk tolerance appears moderate: they will sometimes make a high contribution into a cooperative environment, but they avoid sustained high contributions when there is ambiguity or clear partial free-riding in the group.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThe player never sends chat messages in this transcript. Their communication style is therefore “silent observer”: they read others’ coordination attempts and reactions but do not verbally engage, persuade, or negotiate. This indicates either a preference for low social engagement, a strategic choice to remain opaque, or indifference to influencing others through talk; which of these dominates is unknown.\n\nThey do not explicitly endorse or reject proposed cooperation schemes in chat, nor do they confront low contributors. All responsiveness to others happens through their contribution choices rather than words. There is no evidence of attempts to build trust, signal intentions, or enforce norms verbally. Their tone, where it cannot be observed, is unknown; their engagement style is best described as passive and non-confrontational, relying on action rather than dialogue.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThe player does not display a strong, visible end-game shift. Their contributions in the final phase remain within the same general low-to-moderate band they use throughout the game. There is no clear pattern of last-minute exploitation by dropping to minimal contributions, nor a final-round surge of “gift giving” or symbolic cooperation. This suggests that they either do not heavily adjust for the finite horizon or that their baseline strategy—conditional, moderately self-serving cooperation—is already close to what they regard as end-game optimal.\n\nThey likely understand that there is a finite number of rounds (the interface displays it), but their behavior suggests they prioritize a steady heuristic over explicit backward induction. Any subtle changes in the final rounds stay aligned with their overall pattern: contribute some when others are highly cooperative, and avoid large sacrifices when high cooperation is mixed with low contributors. Whether they consciously reason about the horizon or simply follow a learned rule of thumb is unknown, but they do not dramatically unravel cooperation at the end.\n\n<REWARD>\nThe player never spends any coins on rewarding others, even when others contribute maximally and overall cooperation is very high. This shows a strong reluctance to invest personal resources into social enforcement or positive reciprocity when the reward mechanism is one-to-one and provides no direct multiplier. Their behavior is consistent with viewing reward as individually inefficient: paying one coin to give one coin to someone else does not improve their own payoff and is therefore avoided.\n\nThey do accept rewards from others when given, but there is no observable reciprocation; being rewarded does not trigger them to reward in return. This indicates that they do not use rewards strategically to build reciprocal relationships, reinforce high contributors, or signal gratitude. Instead, they rely solely on their own contribution adjustments as a response mechanism. Their “reward strategy” is effectively null: they refrain from using the tool at all, treating it as a dominated or unnecessary option given their priorities.\n\nOverall, this paints a type who cooperates conditionally at the contribution stage but abstains entirely from costly reward, focusing on maintaining personal earnings while contributing enough to benefit from others’ cooperation.", "umap_x": 0.5648646354675293, "umap_y": 0.7484490871429443, "cluster_id": 5, "cluster_size": 37, "cluster_title": "Reward / Cooperation / Contribution", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around reward, cooperation, contribution, free, contributions."}

They contribute fully in some stretches, especially when others also contribute high amounts or when cooperation seems coordinated, but they then revert to zero when they can benefit from others’ continued giving. This pattern indicates conditionality (their contribution is sensitive to group behavior) combined with a strong self-interest motive (they maximize private payoff whenever the group seems willing to carry the public good). They do not show a strong fairness norm; they are comfortable taking full advantage of others’ higher contributions and do not systematically try to “match” or “even out” with them. Their risk tolerance appears moderate: they are willing to fully contribute when others are already cooperating or when there is a clear cooperative norm, but when expectations are more uncertain or when they can foresee a better private return by defecting, they freely do so. Over the game, they do not settle on a single stable contribution level; instead, they alternate between cooperative bursts and freeriding, which suggests ongoing calculation rather than a fixed pro- or anti-social type.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThey do not use the chat at all, despite others attempting to coordinate and discuss strategies. This persistent silence suggests a low-engagement, observational style: they prefer to watch what others do and respond via contributions rather than via talk. They do not attempt to persuade, set norms, or signal intentions verbally. This avoidance of communication may reflect a strategy of minimizing social accountability: by not entering the conversation, they do not create explicit commitments that others might expect them to honor. It also makes their behavior less predictable socially, even though their contributions are quite patterned numerically. Their lack of direct responses to evident coordination attempts implies that they free-ride not only on contributions but also on others’ efforts to create and maintain cooperative agreements.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThey show clear awareness of the finite horizon and act accordingly. Near the end of the game they revert decisively to zero contributions in alternating fashion, including in the final round, even while several others still contribute high amounts.

This pattern indicates that, as the end approaches, they increasingly prioritize short-term private payoff over sustaining group welfare and do not expect future reciprocal benefits.

There is no evidence that they reduce contributions in response to repeated low contributions by specific others, even when they could improve their own monetary payoff by doing so, suggesting that fairness concerns are expressed primarily via punishment rather than via withholding contributions. Risk tolerance appears high in the sense that they continue to “trust” the group with full cooperation even after sharp drops in others’ contributions. Whether this stems from principled commitment, inattention to incentives, or a strong desire to maintain group harmony is unknown, but the behavioral pattern is very stable and non-conditional on recent group behavior.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThe player communicates rarely but in a socially engaged, non-hostile way. They participate minimally in chat compared to others, speaking only a few times. When they do speak, they show awareness of others’ behavior and of the contribution records, and they directly address a known low contributor by name. Their tone remains light and teasing rather than angry or moralizing, implying a preference for soft social pressure over confrontational shaming. They also publicly correct a misleading claim from another player about their contributions, indicating attention to detail and willingness to point out discrepancies. There is no evidence of them taking an explicit leadership role in coordination (e.g., proposing strategies or enforcing norms via verbal threats), but their comments do support the cooperative coalition and reinforce expectations that everyone should contribute fully. They do not discuss money amounts, bonuses, or conversion rates, suggesting their primary orientation is toward the cooperation structure rather than the payoff calculus, although this is low confidence.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThe player does not exhibit any end-game defection or contribution decay. They maintain full contributions through the final periods, including the last round, even when some others persistently contribute nothing. There is no indication that they attempt to exploit the finite horizon by free-riding at the end, nor do they “give up” on cooperation despite occasional collapses in group contributions late in the game. Their punishment pattern also continues through the final period, implying that they either do not strategically discount the future or they place intrinsic value on norm enforcement independent of continuation payoffs. Overall, their behavior is horizon-insensitive: they act as if the same cooperative and enforcement rules apply from beginning to end, with no observable ramp-up in selfishness or withdrawal.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThe player actively uses costly punishment and appears to be a consistent “altruistic enforcer.” They punish only when others’ contributions are below the group’s implicit norm of full cooperation, and they abstain from punishment when everyone contributes fully. Their pattern fits selective, contribution-contingent punishment rather than spite or random use of the mechanism. The costs they incur on themselves for punishment are non-trivial, and they continue to punish even when free-riding and partial cooperation persist, indicating a willingness to sacrifice payoff to uphold the norm. They target apparent repeat free-riders rather than occasional or ambiguous deviations, and they escalate punishment when multiple players under-contribute simultaneously. The motive appears primarily deterrence and norm enforcement—there is no evidence of retaliation against anyone for punishing them, because they are never punished. They do not verbally threaten punishment; their enforcement is behavioral rather than rhetorical.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nThe player is never observed being punished, so there is no direct evidence of their reaction to receiving sanctions, nor of any retaliation, forgiveness, or compliance dynamics in response to identified punishers. All inferences about their response to being punished are unknown. Indirectly, their own pattern of norm-based punishment without escalation or verbal aggression suggests they might interpret punishment as a coordination or enforcement signal rather than as a personal attack, but this is speculative and low confidence.", "umap_x": -1.110147476196289, "umap_y": -0.7175740599632263, "cluster_id": 0, "cluster_size": 40, "cluster_title": "Punishment / Contributions / Contribution", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around punishment, contributions, contribution, norm, cooperation."}

They prioritize maximizing group efficiency and appear to understand that full contribution by everyone yields the highest collective payoff. Their cooperation does not weaken when others free‑ride, and they do not experiment with withholding contributions to protect themselves or to test others. They exhibit a strong fairness norm: they expect everyone to contribute fully and treat any deviation as a norm violation. Risk tolerance is high; they continue to contribute fully even when many others are contributing nothing and when they themselves are targeted by punishment, suggesting they value adherence to the cooperative norm and/or expected monetary bonus over short‑term personal safety or spiteful withdrawal.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nTheir tone is generally friendly, lightly humorous, and socially engaging. They initiate early greetings and quickly move to coordination, explicitly proposing universal maximum contribution and linking it to higher earnings. They also immediately endorse and normalize the use of punishment as a tool against noncontributors, indicating a willingness to back norms with sanctions. They give clear, concrete instructions to others about how to use the interface to contribute, and they repeatedly explain or clarify payoff structure and mechanics when others ask, suggesting a didactic and pro‑social orientation. They respond promptly to others’ comments, show some playful banter, and soften criticism with informal language and light humor, while still directly calling out noncontributors. Overall, they engage rather than withdraw, using communication to coordinate, persuade, and correct, rather than to vent or disengage.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThere is no detectable end‑game decay in cooperation: their contribution behavior is identical from start to finish, including the final rounds. They show no visible horizon‑driven shift toward free‑riding, even after being punished. Their use of punishment also persists into the last rounds against persistent defectors, indicating they do not reduce sanctioning effort merely because the game is about to end. They appear aware that payoffs convert to real money and refer to the bonus structure, but this awareness does not lead to strategic tapering of contributions or avoidance of costly punishment near the end. Overall, they behave as if the cooperative norm and enforcement principle are more important than exploiting the finite horizon.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey are a frequent and often heavy punisher. They reliably target low or zero contributors and do not appear to punish cooperators; punishment is selective and norm‑based rather than random. They sometimes spend substantial amounts to sanction free riders, at times at levels well beyond the minimal “signal” level, suggesting a strong preference for norm enforcement even at significant personal cost. The timing of punishment decisions indicates a deterrence and corrective motive: they apply sanctions when others contribute little or nothing, and they ease off when those others subsequently contribute fully, then re‑escalate when defection reappears. Their chat reveals openness to using punishment from the beginning and frames it as a group‑backed response to defection. There is no evidence of retaliatory punishment against those who previously punished them; their sanctions remain focused on contribution behavior. Overall, they function as a prosocial enforcer: they accept personal losses to uphold a high contribution norm.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nThey are punished at least once, but do not comment on it, do not reduce their contribution, and do not visibly retaliate. Their behavior toward others after being punished remains cooperative and norm‑oriented; they continue to fully contribute and keep punishing defectors rather than shifting blame or targeting potential punishers. This suggests relative forgiveness or at least non‑retaliation in practice, and a strong separation between enforcement of contribution norms and personal feelings about being targeted. Their silence about receiving punishment implies either that they accept punishment as part of the environment, that they do not know who did it, or that they choose not to escalate socially, but the key observable is that they stay committed to cooperation and principled punishment rather than entering a punitive spiral.", "umap_x": -0.9478874802589417, "umap_y": -0.7815013527870178, "cluster_id": 0, "cluster_size": 40, "cluster_title": "Punishment / Contributions / Contribution", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around punishment, contributions, contribution, norm, cooperation."}

They repeatedly give the maximum allowed amount even when others free-ride and even when group cooperation temporarily collapses. Their behavior suggests they understand that maximal group contributions increase payoffs and they align with that norm without visibly conditioning on others’ behavior in the short term. They do not visibly switch to partial or strategic free-riding; the only deviation from full contribution is a single instance of contributing nothing when group cooperation is very low, which is too sparse to infer a systematic conditional strategy and might reflect experimentation, frustration, or error (true motive unknown). They appear comfortable sacrificing individual tokens to sustain a cooperative norm, indicating low aversion to being slightly exploited as long as the system generally works. Their risk tolerance appears moderate-to-high in social terms: they continue to invest fully in the public good despite repeated defection by at least one peer, suggesting they are willing to risk being taken advantage of in pursuit of higher collective gains. Fairness norms seem oriented toward “everyone should give the max because it makes us all better off,” rather than toward strict tit-for-tat or payoff equalization.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nTheir communication is brief, pragmatic, and cooperative. They engage in group chat but do not attempt to lead or enforce norms aggressively. Their tone is calm and informational rather than emotional or confrontational. They ask clarifying questions about the game’s payoff structure and contribution limits and share their understanding of the monetary bonus when others ask, indicating an interest in mutual clarity and helping others play effectively. They acknowledge group plans to contribute the maximum and signal agreement, but they leave the stronger norm enforcement and pressure to more vocal players. They respond when engaged, showing responsiveness but not high talkativeness. Overall, their style is low-drama, task-focused, and mildly prosocial: they communicate enough to coordinate and inform, but avoid blame, sarcasm, or heated exchanges.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nAwareness of the game horizon is not directly expressed in chat, and their contribution pattern does not show a clear end-game decay: they continue to contribute the maximum in the late rounds, including the final round, even after multiple prior experiences of others free-riding. There is one late-game instance where they give nothing while several others also under-contribute, but they immediately return to full cooperation afterward. This isolated deviation does not line up cleanly with a rational end-game unraveling pattern and appears more like a reaction to a specific low-cooperation state or an anomaly (true reason unknown, low confidence). Overall, they act as if the cooperative norm should persist through the end, showing little sign of systematically discounting future cooperation as the game nears completion.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey almost never use the punishment mechanism, despite experiencing repeated free-riding by specific others and having clear information about who contributes what. Across the game they pay to punish only once, and that single use of punishment coincides with a round where they themselves also do not contribute. The specific target and rationale are not observable, so the motive is unknown; it could be directed at a chronic free-rider, a perceived norm violator in that moment, or could even be exploratory use of the mechanism. The overall pattern indicates a very low baseline willingness to punish. They do not behave like a “moralist” cooperator who regularly sanctions defectors; instead, they seem to rely mainly on positive cooperation and communication rather than deterrence. When others discuss punishing non-contributors, this player does not follow through with actual sanctions, suggesting reluctance to spend own resources on harming others even when it might promote cooperation.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nThey are never punished by others, so their behavioral response to being sanctioned is unknown. There is no evidence of retaliation, accommodation, or verbal reaction to punishment because it never occurs. Their one act of punishing does not provoke any visible interaction directed at them, so their response to being identifiable as a punisher is also unknown. Based on their generally calm and cooperative communication style, one could tentatively expect relatively low reactivity to social slights, but this is speculative and not directly supported by observed punishment dynamics; confidence on their response to punishers is low and should be treated as unknown.", "umap_x": -1.0255616903305054, "umap_y": -0.10657788813114166, "cluster_id": 0, "cluster_size": 40, "cluster_title": "Punishment / Contributions / Contribution", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around punishment, contributions, contribution, norm, cooperation."}
{"experiment": "3uqZPGxnY38PPCreu", "participant": "EBB5atRiWmHKS6tBq", "game_finished": true, "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is primarily a high, almost unconditional cooperator who occasionally experiments with defection. For the overwhelming majority of the game, they contribute the maximum possible amount regardless of whether others do the same. Their cooperation is only weakly conditional: when some group members free‑ride repeatedly, the player still continues to contribute fully most of the time instead of matching or undercutting them. They do, however, test defection a couple of times after a long run of full cooperation, indicating they are not a pure altruist; they are willing to see what happens when they keep their endowment, even after having helped maintain a cooperative norm.\n\nTheir fairness norm is pro‑group but relaxed. They clearly prefer full-contribution outcomes and express appreciation when a previous low contributor starts contributing. At the same time, they are tolerant of deviations and do not push others aggressively toward the norm. When they defect once in an otherwise cooperative environment and are heavily punished, they immediately revert to full contributions and largely stay there, suggesting they are sensitive to social feedback and willing to “fall back in line” when norm enforcement is strong.\n\nRisk tolerance appears moderate. They are willing to risk being a consistent cooperator even when some others are not, accepting lower immediate payoffs for the chance of sustaining high group returns. Their two zero‑contribution choices look like controlled probes rather than a wholesale strategy shift: they do not cascade into continued free‑riding, nor do they signal a desire to dismantle cooperation entirely. There is no evidence of systematic payoff optimization; behavior is more consistent with a cooperative default plus occasional opportunistic or exploratory non‑cooperation.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThe player’s tone is relaxed, mildly humorous, and de‑escalating. When another player becomes critical of non‑contributors, they respond by downplaying the seriousness of the situation and framing it as “just a game,” signaling low appetite for social conflict and moralizing. They do not join in blaming or shaming talk, even when they might be justified in doing so as a consistent contributor.\n\nThey engage selectively rather than constantly. When they do speak, it is purposeful: once to cool down tension, once to clarify payoff information, and once to express gratitude toward a previously uncooperative member who starts contributing. This shows responsiveness to both emotional and informational aspects of the interaction, but they do not try to lead or organize the group.\n\nPersuasion style is soft and indirect. They neither instruct others what to do nor threaten them. Instead, they acknowledge others’ efforts and ask neutral questions about the reward structure. Their engagement style is cooperative and affiliative but not highly invested; they care about good outcomes and smooth interaction, yet they also keep a bit of emotional distance, emphasizing that the stakes are limited.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThere is little evidence of a classic “end-game collapse” pattern. The player’s contribution profile near the end stays mostly aligned with their general cooperative tendency. They do not make a clear, strategic shift to sustained free‑riding in the final rounds despite knowing the horizon length, nor do they ramp up contributions uniquely at the very end.\n\nTheir occasional switch to non‑contribution occurs in the later middle of the game, but it is brief and reversed quickly. After testing defection and encountering strong punishment, they largely return to full contributions, including in the last stretch. This suggests that horizon awareness does not dominate their behavior; they appear more anchored in ongoing group norms and recent social feedback than in backward induction logic. Any end‑game awareness influence is weak or unknown.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey never use the punishment mechanism in any round, even when doing so could credibly enforce cooperation or retaliate for heavy sanctions against them. This indicates a strong reluctance to spend personal resources to harm others, even in cases of clear free‑riding or personal grievance.\n\nTheir threshold for punishing appears extremely high or absent. They experience a severe deduction after a single defection yet do not retaliate against any identifiable partner. Nor do they use sanctions earlier to discipline chronic under‑contributors, despite repeated opportunities and a group norm that openly supports penalizing non‑contributors. This pattern points to a non‑punitive, low‑aggression type: they accept that others may misbehave or punish them without actively engaging in retribution or norm enforcement.\n\nMotivationally, they lean toward “live and let live” rather than either prosocial punishment (to protect the group) or antisocial punishment (to punish cooperators). They seem to rely on persuasion, tolerance, and their own cooperative example rather than formal sanctions to shape behavior. Any latent deterrence motives are unknown or not expressed.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nWhen they defect once after a long record of cooperation and then receive a very large punishment, their behavioral response is compliant and conciliatory rather than hostile. They do not reduce contributions in anger; instead, they immediately return to full contributions in the next cooperative opportunity and maintain that behavior in subsequent rounds. This suggests that they interpret punishment as a strong social signal to re‑adhere to the norm, and they comply without overt protest.\n\nThey show no evidence of retaliating against punishers, despite punishers being identifiable and the deduction being harsh enough to plausibly provoke revenge in many players. They also do not confront anyone verbally about the punishment. This implies a forgiving or at least resignation‑oriented stance toward being sanctioned. They update their play rather than their willingness to attack others.\n\nAt the same time, they do not explicitly apologize or self‑justify in chat; their response is behavioral rather than verbal. Their core pattern is: accept the social cost, restore cooperative behavior, and avoid escalation. Their stance toward the punishing individuals themselves remains behaviorally cooperative and non‑aggressive, consistent with a conflict‑averse, norm‑sensitive cooperator type.", "umap_x": -0.8502715826034546, "umap_y": 0.061460644006729126, "cluster_id": 1, "cluster_size": 27, "cluster_title": "Contributions / Contribution / Cooperation", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around contributions, contribution, cooperation, group, high."}

Across the game, they choose the maximum contribution in the majority of rounds and seem comfortable with the efficient, fully cooperative outcome when others also contribute. Their pattern is not strictly stable: they occasionally contribute nothing in otherwise cooperative environments, suggesting willingness to exploit the public good at times or to express frustration via non-contribution.\n\nTheir deviations from full contribution appear conditional, not random. When another player systematically under-contributes, they sometimes respond by also withholding their own contribution and by escalating punishment. This indicates a fairness-oriented conditional strategy: they prefer mutual full contribution but are willing to sacrifice efficiency to punish or protest against perceived free-riding.\n\nThey appear to understand the payoff structure at least at a basic, behavioral level: they repeatedly return to full contribution after episodes of conflict, and they maintain full contribution throughout many cooperative stretches, implying they perceive that mutual cooperation is profitable. Risk tolerance seems moderate: they invest heavily in punishment at times, absorbing substantial short-term payoffs losses, but they otherwise play a fairly straightforward cooperative strategy rather than trying intricate exploitation patterns.\n\nOverall, they fit a “conditional cooperator with punitive streak” type: they default to maximal contribution when others appear cooperative but are willing to suspend cooperation when angered by persistent defection or when trying to discipline an outlier.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThe player engages in light, somewhat sarcastic conversation and is socially responsive rather than withdrawn. Early on, they verbally endorse the group proposal to all contribute fully and accept the cooperative norm set by others. Their tone ranges from casual and humorous to mildly hostile when criticizing an apparent free-rider, showing that they use chat both for social bonding and for social sanctioning.\n\nThey do not lead coordination or provide detailed instructions; instead, they follow others’ coordination attempts and occasionally comment on others’ behavior or the avatars. Their explanation about having “pressed the wrong button” after being praised for punishment reads more like a face-saving or humorous remark than a serious claim of confusion, given that their actual contribution pattern is already largely cooperative. This suggests they occasionally manage impressions or downplay their own intentional deviations.\n\nThey respond when spoken to and acknowledge group dynamics, but they do not actively negotiate complex strategies, monetary calculations, or long-term plans. Their communication style is engaged but not dominant, emotionally expressive but not fully confrontational, and aligned with maintaining a cooperative group identity with some playful antagonism toward defectors.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThere is no clear evidence of a strong end-game unraveling in their contributions. They continue to choose the maximum contribution in most of the later rounds and do not show a monotonic decline as the game approaches its final stages. Instances of zero contribution later in the game coincide with broader breakdowns in group cooperation, not specifically with the known horizon.\n\nThey appear aware of the structure (rounds are numbered and discussed by others), but their behavior does not show a systematic “it’s almost over, so I defect” strategy. Instead, their late-game choices oscillate with group behavior: they defect in one late round during a wider collapse in contributions and return to full contribution once cooperation resumes. Their final round behavior remains cooperative even though the incentive to defect is highest, suggesting either a stable internal norm for contributing or continued desire to align with the cooperative majority more than a horizon-focused payoff maximization.\n\nGiven the limited direct evidence, their horizon awareness is unknown, but their behavior is more consistent with norm-following than with calculated end-game exploitation.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThe player is a frequent and heavy user of punishment, willing to incur large personal costs to sanction perceived free-riders. They do not punish indiscriminately across all rounds: their punishment expenditures cluster around periods when one or more players visibly contribute nothing while the rest of the group cooperates. This timing suggests that punishment is primarily triggered by norm violations (under-contribution relative to the group), not by random aggression.\n\nThey are willing to target at least one focal low contributor intensely, investing enough coins into punishment to significantly reduce their own payoffs. This indicates that, at times, they prioritize enforcing fairness or expressing disapproval over immediate monetary gain. When group cooperation breaks down more broadly and multiple players start contributing nothing, their punishment intensity drops to zero, even though opportunities for punishment remain. That pattern is consistent with a deterrence goal: when there is no longer a clear cooperative norm or deviant minority, punishing becomes less meaningful to them.\n\nRetaliatory motives cannot be ruled out—this player is themselves punished in some of the same episodes in which they use heavy punishment, and the mutual deductions may reflect tit-for-tat dynamics. However, the structure of their punishment (focusing on contributors who are consistently at zero when others are cooperative) is more aligned with norm-enforcement than with blind revenge. They thus fit a “strong norm enforcer” type who uses punishment aggressively when they see a single or small set of deviants in an otherwise cooperative group and largely refrains once norms collapse.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nThe player receives nontrivial punishment in several rounds, including ones where they themselves deviate from full contribution. Their observable reaction is mixed: on the one hand, they do not engage in overt verbal retaliation against specific punishers and do not name or accuse them in chat. On the other hand, they continue to punish heavily even while being punished, indicating that they do not back down in response to sanctions and do not immediately shift to a more conciliatory, cooperative posture toward those who punish them.\n\nThey briefly offer a humorous or face-saving explanation about “pressing the wrong button” after another player praises their punitive actions. This remark comes after a period where they both deviated from the contribution norm and used strong punishment, and after they had been punished themselves. This suggests that when confronted socially with their behavior, they prefer to diffuse tension with humor or plausible deniability rather than directly admit exploitative or spiteful intent.\n\nThey do not appear to systematically retaliate directly against punishers as punishers; instead, their punishment pattern stays tied to contribution behavior, not to who punished them. Compliance with norms after being punished is partial: they return to full contribution in many subsequent rounds, but this also coincides with a reestablishment of group cooperation, so it is unclear whether they are responding to punishment, group expectations, or their own preferences. Overall, they show a combination of stubbornness (continuing to use punishment despite being punished) and social smoothing (joking explanations) rather than clear submissive compliance or vindictive counter-punishment.", "umap_x": -1.2673653364181519, "umap_y": -0.7612375020980835, "cluster_id": 0, "cluster_size": 40, "cluster_title": "Punishment / Contributions / Contribution", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around punishment, contributions, contribution, norm, cooperation."}

They consistently choose the full endowment contribution in nearly all rounds, including late in the game, even after multiple episodes of others free-riding. Their pattern indicates a stable preference for group efficiency and adherence to the “everyone contributes max” norm, rather than opportunistic exploitation. The single low-contribution choice appears as an isolated deviation rather than the start of a new strategy; there is no follow-up shift toward persistent free-riding. They do not condition their own contributions tightly on others’ behavior: they continue to contribute fully in many instances where at least one peer is clearly free-riding. This suggests either a strong internal norm of cooperation, low sensitivity to short-term unfairness, or a focus on maintaining group coordination rather than maximizing narrow individual payoff. Fairness matters to them in the sense that they are willing to pay to punish low contributors, but they do not let perceived unfairness systematically reduce their own contribution level. Risk tolerance appears moderate: they repeatedly “trust” the group by contributing fully after cooperation is restored, and do not preemptively defect as a hedge against possible future free-riding.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nTheir communication is minimal, affiliative, and compliant with group norms. They speak very little compared with others and do not initiate strategy discussions or attempt to lead coordination. When another player proposes a cooperative norm tied to punishment, they give a brief, positive acknowledgment, signaling agreement and alignment with that cooperative-punitive coalition rather than challenging or refining it. They do not push back against free-riders verbally; their social enforcement is via the punishment mechanism, not through chat. They also do not join in mild ridicule or moralizing comments made by others, nor do they defend low contributors; instead, they stay largely silent. Overall, they engage selectively, signaling assent and group belonging, but avoid taking a central or directive role. Their tone is neutral to friendly; there is no evidence of hostility, sarcasm, or open conflict.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThey show little evidence of a classic end-game unraveling. Their contributions remain high through the final phases, including the last round, even when at least one other player is still free-riding. There is a single late-game deviation to zero contribution, but they immediately return to full contributions in subsequent rounds rather than escalating defection as the horizon approaches. This suggests they do not rely on backward induction or a “last-round grab” as a guiding principle. Instead, they appear to maintain a cooperative rule-of-thumb throughout the game, treating the final rounds similarly to the middle rounds in terms of contribution behavior. Their willingness to keep contributing fully near the end implies either that they value norm consistency over marginal end-game gains, or that they mentally simplify the problem and do not significantly adjust strategy based on remaining rounds. Their punishment behavior near the end also continues in a similar pattern, indicating no clear ramp-up of vindictive or exploitative behavior as the game closes.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey are a selective but recurring punisher of low contributors. They do not punish in every instance of free-riding, but they use the mechanism multiple times across the game, reliably in contexts where at least one identifiable peer contributes less than the cooperative norm. There is no evidence that they punish high contributors or use punishment arbitrarily, which suggests a focus on norm enforcement rather than random aggression. The size of their punishment is modest and stable; they do not escalate dramatically even when low contributions recur. This pattern is consistent with a player who uses punishment as a costly signal and deterrent rather than as emotional retaliation. They also refrain from punishing when everyone contributes fully, supporting the interpretation that they tie punishment specifically to contribution deviations. The overall pattern fits a conditional cooperator with a willingness to incur moderate costs to sustain group cooperation and discipline free-riders. Their repeated return to punishment after periods of renewed free-riding suggests persistence in this role rather than giving up on enforcement.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nThey are never punished in the transcript, so their direct response to being targeted is unknown. Consequently, their attitudes toward identifiable punishers, in terms of forgiveness, retaliation, or compliance when personally punished, cannot be inferred. However, from the fact that they themselves engage in norm-enforcing punishment aligned with the group’s stated cooperative standard, it is plausible—but not confirmable—that they would view justified, contribution-based punishment as legitimate. Whether they would retaliate against perceived unfair punishment or reduce contributions in response is unknown, and confidence about their reactions to personal sanctions is low.", "umap_x": -1.1811211109161377, "umap_y": -0.3082723319530487, "cluster_id": 0, "cluster_size": 40, "cluster_title": "Punishment / Contributions / Contribution", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around punishment, contributions, contribution, norm, cooperation."}
{"experiment": "3uqZPGxnY38PPCreu", "participant": "Tp8oQGvpodpWCxH4M", "game_finished": true, "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player alternates between full cooperation and full free-riding, never choosing intermediate contributions (which are not available here). The pattern is unstable and oscillatory rather than converging on one mode. They repeatedly free-ride when others are contributing fully, despite explicit group norms favoring maximum contributions and despite experiencing substantial punishment for those choices. At other times, they contribute fully and align with the cooperative norm, especially after having just been punished or closely instructed on how to contribute. Their behavior suggests that they understand, at least intermittently, that full contribution yields higher payoffs and group approval, but they either discount these benefits, periodically revert to exploitative play, or treat the game as low-stakes/experimental. They do not appear driven by a strong fairness norm; they willingly take the benefit of others’ cooperation while not contributing themselves, even after being reminded and socially pressured. Conditional cooperation is weak and inconsistent: they sometimes cooperate when others do, but they also defect while others cooperate and occasionally defect even when a subset of others starts defecting, with no clear pattern of “matching” the group. Risk tolerance appears moderate to high: they are willing to incur predictable punishment losses to test or maintain free-riding, indicating either low sensitivity to monetary loss, confusion at times, or a willingness to trade earnings for some other motive (e.g., asserting autonomy, experimenting). Overall, they fit a “noisy opportunist” profile: not purely selfish or purely cooperative, but switching between exploiting the public good and supporting it.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThey communicate sparingly but not completely passively. Early on, they respond affirmatively to a suggestion that full contributions maximize group payoffs, signaling understanding and nominal agreement with cooperative strategy. Later, when accused of not contributing, they assert that they are contributing, which contradicts the observed contribution decisions. This may indicate confusion about the interface, defensive self-presentation, or deliberate misrepresentation; the data do not distinguish clearly. They do not initiate strategic coordination, propose norms, or discuss punishment or fairness explicitly. Their tone remains neutral to mildly defensive; there is no sign of open hostility, mockery, or apology. They acknowledge others’ advice at least once and change behavior in a way consistent with having followed instructions, but they do not verbally thank or reinforce others. Their engagement style is minimal and reactive: they speak only when prompted or challenged, seldom use chat for proactive coordination, and do not try to persuade others to change their behavior.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nAwareness of the finite horizon is given by the interface, but there is no explicit verbal reference from this player to the remaining rounds. Behavior in the late game shows no simple monotonic decay into defection: they continue to alternate between full contribution and zero contribution in the final third of the game. They sometimes cooperate in late rounds despite everyone else continuing to cooperate, and also sometimes defect under those same conditions, suggesting that end-game reasoning (e.g., backward induction) is not their dominant driver. Instead, the same unstable pattern of cooperation and defection continues: full cooperation in some late rounds, free-riding with predictable punishment in others. There is no clear “last-round free-ride blowout”; they do defect in the final round while everyone else cooperates, and are punished, but this is consistent with their earlier intermittent free-riding rather than a distinct end-game shift. Overall, they show limited horizon-sensitive strategy; their approach appears myopic or driven by short-lived impulses/experiments rather than a planned end-game escalation of defection.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey use punishment in a selective but not especially strategic way. They punish infrequently, but when they do, it tends to occur in rounds where they themselves are defecting and at least one other player is also defecting. This makes it impossible to infer whether they are targeting specific defectors or reciprocally punishing cooperators; the transcript does not show targets, and their own role as a defector complicates interpretation. The timing does indicate that they are willing to pay to punish even in situations where they are simultaneously violating the cooperative norm themselves. This pattern is more consistent with reactive or emotionally driven punishment (e.g., frustration at being punished or at others’ behavior) than with well-calibrated norm enforcement aimed at sustaining cooperation. Their punishment expenditures are small relative to possible maximums, suggesting they are not a “hard enforcer”; they experiment with punishment but do not commit heavily to it as a strategy. There is no clear evidence that they use punishment to deter others or protect cooperators; equally, there is no clear evidence of targeted retaliation against specific individuals, because target identities are not visible here. Motivation behind punishment is therefore uncertain, but likely a mix of low-level retaliation/frustration and exploration of the mechanism, rather than principled norm enforcement.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nThey are repeatedly punished for free-riding, sometimes quite heavily. Their behavioral adjustment to being punished is partial and short-lived. After experiencing punishment, they often switch to full contribution for at least the subsequent round, indicating some responsiveness and a capacity to learn that non-contribution has costs. However, this compliance is unstable: after one or a few cooperative rounds, they revert again to free-riding even though they can reasonably anticipate renewed punishment. This suggests that being punished induces temporary compliance but does not internalize the cooperative norm. Their minimal chat response shows neither explicit anger nor gratitude; they do not confront punishers, apologize, or overtly negotiate. When others point out their lack of contribution, they insist they are contributing despite the public record showing otherwise, which may be interpreted as defensiveness, confusion, or a desire to avoid being seen as intentionally exploitative. They do not clearly engage in directed counter-punishment of specific punishers (target data are unavailable), so explicit retaliation toward identifiable individuals is unknown. The overall profile is of a player who is behaviorally influenced by punishment in the short term but does not adopt sustained cooperation, and who manages reputation through denial rather than open conflict or reconciliation.", "umap_x": -1.1931124925613403, "umap_y": -0.6856024265289307, "cluster_id": 0, "cluster_size": 40, "cluster_title": "Punishment / Contributions / Contribution", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around punishment, contributions, contribution, norm, cooperation."}
{"experiment": "3uqZPGxnY38PPCreu", "participant": "hCZFZSeJ2Jjj4oqhY", "game_finished": true, "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a highly cooperative, near-unconditional full contributor. They almost always give the maximum possible amount, even when others visibly free‑ride and even when cooperation temporarily collapses. Their baseline seems to be: “contribute fully as long as there is any expectation of group cooperation,” rather than strict payoff maximization.\n\nThey do not systematically condition their own contribution on the most recent pattern of others’ contributions. Periods of mixed cooperation and free‑riding from others do not lead them to gradually reduce their own contributions; they remain at the cooperative maximum except for a single deviation. That one deviation is a pure free‑ride move late in the game, made when several others are already contributing nothing and overall contributions are very low. This suggests they understand the strategic structure (they know they can benefit by keeping their own endowment when others are still contributing) but strongly prefer cooperation for most of the game.\n\nThey appear tolerant of some unfairness: they keep contributing fully through repeated instances of another player’s systematic free‑riding, and through intermittent non‑contribution by others. Their own behavior reveals a norm that “everyone should contribute fully,” but they do not immediately “punish” the group by withholding contributions when norms are violated. Risk tolerance seems moderate: they are willing to risk being exploited by free‑riders to maintain a high-payoff cooperative outcome, rather than hedging with partial or zero contributions.\n\nOverall, they fit a “principled cooperator with a late, brief opportunistic deviation” profile: they prioritize group efficiency and equality for most of the horizon, with only a momentary shift toward self‑interest when cooperation around them has already eroded.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThey speak very little in the chat and only once initiate a direct question about real‑money stakes. Their tone is neutral and practical rather than emotional or moralizing; they do not scold, praise, or attempt to coordinate group norms. They neither support nor contest the dominant coalition of players who promote full contribution and the use of punishment to enforce it.\n\nThey are responsive in the limited sense that their one message fits the current thread (discussion about monetary payoffs), but they do not follow up or engage in back‑and‑forth conversation. They do not use chat to justify their own behavior, to complain about free‑riders, or to threaten punishment. Socially, they present as low‑visibility and reserved, preferring implicit coordination through their own consistent contributions rather than explicit persuasion or leadership.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThey show clear awareness of the game horizon through their behavior, not through explicit statements. For most of the game, their strategy remains stable despite changing others’ behavior, which suggests they are not simply following a naive “cooperate until the very end” heuristic. Near the end, after widespread non‑contribution has occurred and cooperative norms are visibly weakened, they engage in a one‑time full free‑ride while also investing heavily in punishment. Immediately after, they revert to maximal cooperation for the remaining rounds.\n\nThis pattern indicates that end‑game effects matter but do not dominate: they are willing to experiment with defection and strong sanctioning once the cost of sustaining cooperation appears high and the social environment looks unstable. However, they quickly return to cooperative behavior even in the final rounds, including in the last round itself. There is no systematic end‑game unraveling in their contributions. Instead, they exhibit a brief “testing” or “frustration” move amid late‑game noise, then reassert their cooperative norm.\n\nOverall, they are not a pure backward rationalizer; they maintain cooperation through the end, with only a small, localized deviation when cooperation from others breaks down.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey are willing but selective punishers. For the majority of the game they refrain from using punishment at all, despite repeated free‑riding from specific others and explicit group chatter that endorses penalizing non‑contributors. Their default is non‑punitive: they do not automatically sanction every deviation from full cooperation.\n\nHowever, they do punish at two distinct points, and both coincide with periods when some players are not contributing. In one case they impose a small sanction at modest personal cost; in another, they invest substantially more in punishment while also choosing to contribute nothing themselves. This indicates they are capable of moving from restraint to strong punitive action when frustrations or norm violations accumulate.\n\nBecause the punishment interface does not reveal to us whom they target, their motive is somewhat uncertain. Given that they are themselves a near‑constant full contributor, and that their punishment episodes align with others’ visible free‑riding, the most plausible interpretation is that they are targeting perceived free‑riders rather than engaging in antisocial punishment. They show no sign of punishing cooperators: whenever the group is fully cooperative, they impose no sanctions.\n\nThe large punishment burst paired with zero contribution suggests a moment of expressive or retributive punishment rather than purely efficiency‑oriented deterrence; they seem willing to accept a significant personal cost to impose larger costs on defectors, particularly once cooperation is already weakened. At the same time, the fact that they quickly return to full cooperation and stop punishing thereafter implies they are not locked into a vengeful spiral. Their general tendency is: “mostly cooperate and avoid punishment, but occasionally use punishment, including strongly, to respond to sustained or repeated non‑cooperation.”\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nThey are never punished by others in this game, so their direct behavioral response to being targeted by identifiable punishers is unknown. They never have to decide whether to forgive, retaliate, or comply in response to personal sanctions, and they never reference punishment in chat. Their attitudes toward punishers and the social meaning of punishment are therefore not observable in this transcript.", "umap_x": -1.113965392112732, "umap_y": -0.24159428477287292, "cluster_id": 0, "cluster_size": 40, "cluster_title": "Punishment / Contributions / Contribution", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around punishment, contributions, contribution, norm, cooperation."}
{"experiment": "3zSNGrLvJJYZhmW2p", "participant": "FKriQtdFBTrWrfGBH", "game_finished": true, "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a volatile, mixed-strategy contributor who oscillates between full cooperation and full free-riding rather than adopting a stable pattern. They only ever use the extremes (all-in or zero) and do not attempt to fine-tune based on marginal returns; they instead appear to treat contribution as a coarse on/off stance. They repeatedly contribute fully even after receiving no clear, consistent cooperative norm from the group, but they also free-ride in many rounds when cooperation is fragile, suggesting they are not committed to maximizing group welfare. Their behavior does not track simple payoff-maximizing logic either, since they often spend on punishment in ways that reduce their earnings and are not obviously profit-seeking. The pattern suggests a mix of experimentation, impatience, and occasional willingness to “play along” with cooperative pushes, but without long-term adherence to a fairness norm. They do not visibly condition contributions on specific individuals’ past actions; instead they respond more to their own frustration and to the perceived tediousness or “stupidity” of the game than to fine-grained changes in group behavior. Overall, they are an unstable conditional cooperator/free-rider hybrid, prone to swings rather than steady norms.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThey communicate sparsely and with low social investment, engaging only a few times across the entire interaction. Early on they greet the group in a neutral, minimal way, showing basic politeness but not strong enthusiasm. They ask an information-seeking question about game length, indicating some concern for planning and time, and later explicitly label the game as stupid and too long, and ask for it to go faster. This reveals impatience, boredom, and low intrinsic engagement with the social or strategic nuance of the game. They do not attempt to persuade others about contribution norms, do not coordinate punishment or reward, and do not respond to others’ detailed cooperation appeals. Their tone is dry and mildly dismissive rather than hostile: they complain about the game rather than about specific players. They do, however, sarcastically thank those who punished them, suggesting a tendency to react emotionally and pointedly when targeted. Overall they are a low-engagement, somewhat cynical communicator, more likely to express frustration than to build consensus.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey are a frequent and heavy user of punishment, and this is their most defining behavioral trait. They spend substantial resources on punishing multiple different individuals across the game, often when those individuals are low contributors, “holdouts,” or otherwise active in shaping group norms. However, their targets are not perfectly aligned with simple cooperation enforcement: they repeatedly punish one particular low contributor who also speaks about the social dilemma, they punish full contributors who are verbally pushing cooperation, and they punish a non-contributor who merely complains about the game’s length. This pattern suggests that punishment is driven by irritation at perceived hypocrisy, moralizing, or talkativeness as much as by pure contribution levels. They appear to use punishment as an expressive tool to signal disagreement, annoyance, or to push back against others’ attempts to set norms, rather than as a calibrated deterrent to maximize group efficiency. They rarely, if ever, explain or justify their punishment choices in chat, leaving their motives implicit and making their sanctions appear unpredictable from others’ perspective. They also sometimes punish despite currently free-riding themselves, indicating low concern about being perceived as fair. Taken together, this is an “expressive/antisocial punisher” profile: they are quite willing to incur costs to harm others, with motives that include disapproval and irritation rather than purely prosocial norm enforcement.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nWhen they are punished, they visibly react but do not clearly become more cooperative toward the punisher. Their single explicit reaction is a sarcastic or dry “thank” directed at those who deducted from them, indicating they notice and resent being targeted. There is no clear evidence that punishment elicits sustained higher contributions from them; their later contribution choices continue to alternate between full and zero, and they also persist in punishing others afterward. They do not attempt to retaliate directly at known punishers in a systematic way (punishment is not obviously redirected at whoever punished them), but their overall pattern suggests that punishment does not teach them pro-social lessons and instead mainly increases their cynicism and expressive hostility. They neither openly forgive nor attempt to reconcile with punishers, and they do not use communication to repair relationships. Overall, being punished leads to sarcastic acknowledgment and continued idiosyncratic behavior rather than compliance or alliance-building.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey essentially do not use rewards as an instrument. Across many opportunities with identifiable high contributors and norm-promoting players, they almost never spend to reward others. The very few instances in which they receive rewards from others do not trigger reciprocal rewarding from them. This indicates that they do not view positive reinforcement as a worthwhile or intuitive tool, either for strategic norm creation or for social bonding. The asymmetry between their high willingness to punish and near-zero willingness to reward is notable and consistent: they incur costs to harm but almost never to help. This fits a profile of someone more motivated by expressing disapproval and frustration than by supporting or encouraging cooperative partners.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThey do receive rewards at several points but never comment on them explicitly in chat and do not respond with visible reciprocity toward specific rewarders. There is no clear behavioral evidence that being rewarded makes them more likely to contribute in subsequent rounds, nor that they direct future rewards or leniency toward those who rewarded them. Their occasional contributions do not clearly track who has treated them kindly. They appear largely indifferent to rewards as social signals; they neither publicly express gratitude nor signal alliance. If their behavior changes after receiving a reward, the pattern is not strong or consistent, so any causal interpretation is low confidence. In effect, rewards have little observable impact on their strategy or expressed attitudes.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey occasionally comment on the structure and feel of the game rather than directly on others’ payoffs or sanctioning choices. They explicitly question game length and later frame the game as stupid and tedious, indicating that time and effort costs loom large in their evaluation. When another player asks why anyone would spend money to deduct others, they do not justify their own extensive punishment use, suggesting they are either unconcerned with appearing rational to others or uninterested in explaining themselves. They do, however, issue a pointed “thank” to those who punished them, indicating they track who is harming them and treat it as notable. They do not openly sympathize with disadvantaged players or with those heavily punished, nor do they comment on extreme reward spending by others. Their verbal focus is more on the meta-experience (length, boredom, stupidity) than on fairness or efficiency outcomes. Overall, they monitor who acts against them and the hassle level of the game, but they do not openly engage with others’ outcome patterns in a constructive or empathetic way.", "umap_x": 0.4300968050956726, "umap_y": -0.8080917596817017, "cluster_id": 4, "cluster_size": 43, "cluster_title": "Punishment / Contribution / Reward", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around punishment, contribution, reward, cooperation, behavior."}
{"experiment": "3zSNGrLvJJYZhmW2p", "participant": "Hzpx2jqhYSZdif4ZN", "game_finished": true, "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a moderate, somewhat noisy conditional cooperator with a persistent pro-cooperation bias. They use both full free-riding and full contribution, never intermediate levels (by design), but overall they contribute more often than they defect. Early on, they switch quickly from free-riding to repeated full contributions once a cooperative norm seems plausible. Across the game they repeatedly continue to contribute even when a substantial minority free-rides, indicating that their internal norm favors “doing their part” over strict payoff-maximization.\n\nTheir contributions are clearly conditional on the group, but the condition is loose: they are willing to keep contributing as long as a visible cooperative core exists, even if some players chronically defect. At several points they contribute while multiple others do not, accepting a clear personal payoff loss, which signals moderate risk tolerance and a prosocial or norm-driven motive rather than pure self-interest.\n\nThey occasionally revert to free-riding, but this appears neither purely exploitative nor purely random. The pattern suggests a mix of (1) opportunistic payback when they feel others are not sufficiently cooperative, and (2) low engagement or fatigue late in the session. They never explicitly articulate fairness norms in chat, but their behavior matches someone who prefers “everyone contributes” and is willing to personally over-contribute to sustain that state.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThey never speak in the chat, despite a very active conversation among others. This consistent silence suggests a low-communication, observational style: they watch others’ talk and behavior but do not try to lead, persuade, or coordinate directly. They therefore do not use verbal promises, threats, or arguments, nor do they publicly justify their own contribution or reward patterns.\n\nBecause they do not correct or respond to others’ comments, their beliefs and intentions must be inferred entirely from choices, not words. Their non-participation in chat also implies they are not trying to build explicit alliances or reputations through language; any reputational strategy they have is expressed behaviorally via contributions and rewards.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey never purchase punishment against any player, despite having many opportunities and witnessing widespread use of costly punishment by others. This indicates a robust anti-punishment stance in practice. They do not use punishment either to retaliate against low contributors or to discipline chronic free-riders, even when that could raise future cooperation. They likewise do not join “punishment coalitions” when others target the same low contributors.\n\nGiven the high effectiveness of punishment in this environment, their refusal to use it points to either (a) a moral or preference-based aversion to harming others even at strategic gain, or (b) a belief that punishment is not worthwhile or is socially corrosive. Since they are willing to spend coins in large amounts to reward, the asymmetry is striking: they are altruistic but not retributive. They also never “punish back” those who defect when the group has built up cooperation, showing no observable revenge motive.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nThey are never directly punished in the transcript. As a result, their response to being punished is unknown. They also never verbally address punishment events directed at others, so their evaluative stance toward punishers is low-confidence: at most, their refusal to punish suggests they do not personally adopt a punishing role, but whether they silently approve, disapprove, or are indifferent to others’ punishment is unknown.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey use reward frequently, consistently, and in a highly selective way, even at significant personal cost. They clearly treat reward as their preferred norm-enforcement and encouragement tool. They never “spray” rewards randomly; instead, they target distinct individuals across many rounds, often those who are visibly cooperative or have just done something that aligns with the cooperative norm (e.g., contributing when others free-ride or engaging constructively in the game).\n\nThey use small, single-unit rewards, suggesting a strategy of lightweight, repeated positive reinforcement rather than large, one-off transfers. Over time, they reward a variety of players: often known cooperators, sometimes apparent “marginal” contributors or communicative players who support cooperation. They do not appear to condition reward on having been rewarded by that same player; reciprocity is possible in a few instances but not systematically evident. The reward pattern looks more like “pro-social approval” than tight tit-for-tat.\n\nThey also continue rewarding even when it is clearly costly relative to their own stage payoff, implying that they value signaling and maintaining a cooperative ethos more than short-run profit. Overall, they function as a non-punitive norm enforcer who “pays to be nice” to sustain group cooperation.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThey are rewarded by others in some rounds, but because they never speak, never reward those specific players in an obviously tightly coupled way, and show no direct behavioral shift tied to who rewarded them, their explicit response is unknown. There is no clear evidence of dyadic “you reward me, I reward you” cycles; their reward behavior appears driven more by others’ contributions and general cooperative standing than by personal gratitude toward rewarders.\n\nThus, while they may internally appreciate being rewarded, their observable actions do not reveal strong targeted reciprocity to rewarders. Any alliance-building through mutual rewards is low-confidence and not clearly traceable.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey clearly monitor others’ contributions and the resulting payoffs and sanctioning patterns, adjusting behavior in a nuanced way. When they see a broad base of cooperation, they are more likely to contribute and to direct rewards to key cooperators or vocal pro-cooperation participants. When they observe substantial free-riding, they sometimes protect their own payoff by free-riding, but instead of punishing defectors, they maintain their positive-reward strategy toward select cooperators.\n\nThey do not react visibly to extreme punishment episodes (such as heavy deductions on some players) by changing into a punisher, nor do they publicly condemn or endorse those punishments, so their evaluative stance toward those outcomes is unknown. However, they do keep rewarding even in an environment where others are using punishment heavily, suggesting they see positive incentives as their preferred lever regardless of the surrounding negativity.\n\nTheir contributions sometimes persist despite repeated evidence that cooperators are being exploited, showing tolerance for inequality when it benefits free-riders, so long as some cooperative outcome remains. At other times they temporarily free-ride when group contributions wane, showing they are not blind altruists: they respond to incentives, but with a consistent bias toward constructive contribution and pro-social rewarding rather than toward exploitation or retaliation.\n\nOverall, this player is best characterized as a “quiet positive enforcer”: a mostly cooperative, non-punitive type who leverages reward rather than punishment to support group norms, avoids verbal engagement, and accepts personal cost to sustain cooperation, while still occasionally retreating into self-protection when group behavior deteriorates.", "umap_x": 0.7170282006263733, "umap_y": -0.5140124559402466, "cluster_id": 6, "cluster_size": 31, "cluster_title": "Punishment / Reward / Contribution", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around punishment, reward, contribution, contributions, low."}

They are willing to contribute fully many times, including when a substantial subset of others also contribute, but they also freely take full advantage of cooperative environments by not contributing while others do. Their decisions do not track a simple rule like “reward cooperators, punish defectors, then comply”; instead, they appear to balance occasional cooperation with frequent self-interested exploitation when it is safe. They never use partial contributions (only all-or-nothing is available), and they show no clear escalation or consistent decline over time; rather, they move back and forth between the extremes. They appear insensitive to direct punishment (they are punished once yet continue to sometimes free-ride) and also insensitive to moral suasion in chat (they cooperate sometimes after “everyone contribute” messages but also defect in very similar environments). Their risk tolerance in terms of payoff seems moderate: they repeatedly expose themselves to possible punishment by defecting while others bear the contribution cost. Fairness norms are weak or at least not consistently expressed in actions; they are willing to be on both sides of inequality (as low earner when most defect, and as high earner when they free-ride on contributors) without using the sanction tools to correct it.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThey speak very little in the chat and do not initiate or shape group norms. Their only clear communicative act is a brief, neutral greeting, without follow-up or engagement in the strategic or moral discussions about cooperation and punishment that others have. They do not argue for any principle (fairness, efficiency, or retribution), do not explain their own choices, and do not respond to others’ expressed frustration or hopes. Their engagement style is passive and minimal: they observe but do not use communication as a coordination or persuasion instrument. There is no evidence of sarcasm, hostility, or strong emotion; tone is neutral and reserved. Their contribution behavior does not obviously change after chat messages, suggesting they are not strongly responsive to verbal pressure or coordination attempts, or at least they do not signal that responsiveness in chat.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey never spend on punishment despite repeated opportunities, even when there are clear, repeated low contributors to target and when others around them are actively punishing. This suggests a strong reluctance to incur personal cost for retribution or deterrence. They do not punish even when they themselves are exploited (i.e., when they contribute while some others defect) and even after being directly punished. This makes a purely retaliatory or moralistic punisher type unlikely. Their non-use of punishment persists throughout, implying a stable preference to avoid costly negative sanctions, regardless of group composition or stage of the game. Whether this is because they view punishment as inefficient, emotionally unappealing, pointless, or ethically wrong is unknown; they provide no explicit reasoning. From behavior alone, they are best characterized as a non-punisher, tolerant of defectors and unwilling to bear personal cost to discipline them.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nThey are punished once and lose a noticeable amount but do not mention it in chat and do not retaliate. They also do not clearly “learn” in a way that aligns with the punisher’s likely goal: after being punished for free-riding, they later defect again in similar social configurations. This indicates low responsiveness to punitive feedback: they neither reorient behavior consistently toward cooperation nor engage in counter-punishment. They also do not attempt appeasement or explicit cooperation signaling directed at the punishing players. Their response pattern is best summarized as silent non-escalation: they absorb punishment without comment, do not change their strategic orientation in a stable, punishment-aligned way, and do not use sanctions in return.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey never spend on reward, even when some players reliably contribute fully and others visibly use positive incentives as social signals. This is not due to lack of opportunity: there are many rounds where they could cheaply reward high contributors or those who rewarded them previously. Their strict abstention suggests they either do not value positive reinforcement as a coordination tool, or they find it too costly or unnecessary. There is no sign of strategic reward use (e.g., to build alliances or encourage near-threshold cooperators) nor of expressive gratitude through material reward. The persona is thus consistently “reward-averse”: they keep their payoff rather than using it to strengthen cooperative partners, even in high-contribution environments that could be sustained via cheap rewards.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThey receive rewards multiple times from others but do not reciprocate materially and do not comment on being rewarded. They do not target their rewarders with reward in later rounds, and they do not shift into a stable full-cooperator stance in apparent gratitude. This suggests low propensity for direct reciprocity in the material domain: they treat incoming rewards as windfalls rather than as part of a relationship to be honored. Socially, they also show no verbal gratitude or alliance-building; the chat remains almost entirely unused by them after being rewarded. Therefore, while they benefit from others’ generosity, they neither reinforce that generosity nor visibly condition their future actions on it.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey observe a rich pattern of others’ behaviors—some players repeatedly sacrificing payoff to reward or punish, others trying to coordinate full cooperation—but they never comment directly on anyone’s payoffs, sanctioning, or sacrifices. They watch high-cost rewarders and heavy punishers, yet do not imitate, support, or criticize them in behavior or chat. Their own contributions do not systematically track who is being punished or rewarded; they cooperate or defect in contexts where cooperators are either being supported or attacked, without visibly adapting to protect or align with them. This indicates a relatively individualistic stance: they appear to treat the public signals of others’ costs and outcomes as background information rather than as cues to form coalitions, enforce norms, or help vulnerable cooperators. In group terms, they behave as a quiet, self-directed participant who benefits from others’ norm-enforcing efforts when convenient but does not help shape or sustain those norms.", "umap_x": 0.8322864174842834, "umap_y": -0.40809160470962524, "cluster_id": 6, "cluster_size": 31, "cluster_title": "Punishment / Reward / Contribution", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around punishment, reward, contribution, contributions, low."}

They comfortably choose either full contribution or full defection, with frequent switching. Early on they both contribute and defect in contexts where many others cooperate, indicating they understand that free-riding is profitable but are not locked into pure defection. Over time, they increasingly exploit high-contribution environments by keeping their own endowment while benefiting from others’ contributions. They nonetheless return to full contribution multiple times even late in the game, which suggests they are not purely payoff-maximizing but balance personal gain with intermittent norm compliance or experimentation. Their contributions weakly condition on others: they sometimes contribute when others are mostly cooperative, but they also defect in highly cooperative groups without showing concern for fairness. There is no clear evidence they target fairness or equalization; they appear comfortable earning more than heavy contributors and do not adjust contributions to reduce inequality. Risk tolerance is moderate: they are willing to contribute even when some free-riding persists, but they also opportunistically defect once they see that cooperation can be exploited.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThey communicate minimally and instrumentally. Their tone is neutral and brief; they greet others and ask a factual question about game length, but they do not engage in persuasion, moralizing, or coalition-building. They do not comment on who should contribute, do not endorse “team” rhetoric, and do not publicly justify their own contribution choices. They respond to the unfolding chat only sporadically and ignore most strategic or moral appeals from others. Overall, they show low social engagement, low investment in group coordination via communication, and no visible attempt to influence norms or punish/reward usage through chat.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey use punishment exactly once, targeting a clear, repeated free-rider. This occurs when that peer has been taking the benefit of group contributions while contributing nothing. The player does not punish other low contributors before or after, nor do they punish ambiguous cases or retaliate for unrelated behavior. This suggests a primarily norm-enforcing impulse directed at a salient exploiter rather than a general taste for punishment. They do not escalate or repeat punishment once applied, and they never use punishment to manage later free-riding even when exploitation becomes common, implying either that the one act is experimental or that the emotional salience of that particular free-rider is unique. They never punish high contributors or apparent cooperators, so antisocial punishment is absent.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nThey are never punished by others in the transcript, so their response is unknown. Their potential for compliance, retaliation, or forgiveness when targeted by punishment is therefore unknown.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey never spend any resources on rewarding others, despite repeated opportunities and despite others’ visible heavy use of rewards, including generous rewarders who benefit them. This indicates a strong reluctance to incur personal cost for positive reciprocity, even when a simple, cheap signal of approval is available. Their pattern suggests either that they see rewards as strategically unnecessary, inefficient, or not worth the cost, or that they are dispositionally low in altruistic rewarding. They do not use rewards to encourage cooperative norms, to thank supporters, or to reciprocate benefits, so they contribute nothing to the maintenance of cooperation via positive incentives.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThey receive rewards multiple times but never respond publicly, either with thanks, reciprocal reward, or visible behavioral alignment toward the rewarders. Their cooperation choices after being rewarded are inconsistent: sometimes they continue to contribute, sometimes they defect despite having just been rewarded for cooperative behavior. This suggests that external positive incentives have limited influence on their strategy, and they do not appear motivated by gratitude or relational reciprocity. They treat rewards as windfall income rather than as social signals that call for response or alliance-building. Whether they can identify specific rewarders from the interface is unclear; but given their total absence of reward actions toward anyone, even general reciprocity is not expressed.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey show no explicit verbal reaction to others’ payoffs, punishment expenditures, or reward patterns. They do not criticize heavy punishers, praise generous rewarders, or remark on inequality. Behaviorally, they tolerate large inefficiencies created by others’ intense punishment and reward usage without adjusting their own punishment or reward behavior, suggesting detachment from those dynamics. They do, however, adapt contributions in ways consistent with noticing that cooperators can be exploited: as others keep contributing and using incentives, this player increasingly free-rides, extracting high payoffs while leaving the cost of cooperation and norm-enforcement to others. Their one punishment act is consistent with an early response to a salient free-rider, after which they ignore subsequent rich outcome information (who is being punished, rewarded, or losing) and revert to a simpler “when convenient, defect” pattern.

They almost always contribute their entire endowment to the public fund, including in early uncertainty, mid-game when others defect, and late-game when many are tired or cynical. Their contributions are only weakly conditional on others’ behavior: they keep contributing fully even when multiple others free ride, and they return to full contribution immediately after their one defection. The brief defection appears more like experimentation, fatigue, or a momentary payoff grab than a shift in norms. They demonstrate a strong fairness norm favoring “everyone all in,” articulated explicitly in chat, and they understand the efficiency of full cooperation. Risk tolerance is high: they consistently expose themselves to exploitation by low contributors rather than protecting their personal payoff. Over time, there is no systematic downward trend, so they do not “learn to defect”; instead, they maintain a prosocial, cooperation-first strategy and treat non-cooperation as something to be nudged via communication and incentives rather than imitated.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nTheir communication is sparse but prosocial, informational, and coordination-oriented. They greet others, briefly help clarify a rule, and later articulate the core efficiency logic of mutual contribution in a straightforward, non-accusatory way. They do not complain about defectors, do not moralize, and do not use sarcasm; tone remains calm and constructive. They do not try to shame or threaten low contributors, instead framing cooperation in terms of mutual benefit (“if we all go in, we all do better”). They are responsive when addressed (e.g., answering a rule question), but they do not dominate conversation or attempt to micromanage the group’s choices. Their style is low-drama, modestly engaged, and focused on enabling understanding rather than pressuring others. They do not react verbally to punishment or reward patterns, suggesting they prefer to “speak” through in-game actions (contributions and rewards) rather than extended chat arguments.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey almost never use punishment and clearly prefer positive incentives. Across the game, they impose a deduction only once, directed at a chronic low contributor. That punishment appears selective and norm-enforcing rather than retaliatory: it targets a player whose cooperation is particularly low and persistent, not someone who punished them (they are never punished) or someone who simply made a one-off mistake. They are willing to pay a modest personal cost to send a negative signal, but this is a last-resort move after long patience with free riding. There is no evidence that they attempt to use punishment systematically as a deterrent; instead, they rely almost entirely on reward to shape behavior and only test punishment once when positive reinforcement and communication have not fully aligned the group. Their overall stance is “reluctant, targeted punisher” with a strong preference to avoid harming others’ payoffs.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nThey are never punished in the observed game, so their direct response to being punished is unknown. There is no data on whether they would retaliate, comply, or adjust behavior following personal punishment. However, given their overall profile—stable contribution, limited use of punishment, and cooperative messaging—it is plausible but low-confidence that they would interpret norm-based punishment as a signal rather than an affront, and that they would be more likely to comply or at least not escalate. This remains speculative; empirically, their response to being punished is unknown.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey are an intensive and systematic user of rewards, clearly willing to spend substantial personal resources to reinforce others’ behavior. They reward many different players across the game, often those who are contributing fully or showing cooperative intent in chat, and they rarely if ever reward low contributors who show no cooperative effort. They sometimes concentrate rewards on a given partner (e.g., multiple units in one round) and sometimes spread them across several cooperators. Their reward behavior is not narrowly self-serving: they reward even when it makes their own net payoff very low or negative in that round, indicating a strong willingness to sacrifice short-term earnings to promote or acknowledge cooperation. They also reward players who themselves are heavy rewarders or visible advocates of cooperation, suggesting they may be reinforcing prosocial leadership and reciprocity norms. Their pattern shows they see reward as their primary instrument for influencing group norms and encouraging contributions, used more frequently and more generously than punishment.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThey are occasionally rewarded by others; when this happens, they do not respond in chat, but their behavior is consistent with appreciating and aligning with other rewarders. They continue to contribute fully and, in some cases, direct rewards toward players who themselves invest in others (such as frequent rewarders or vocal cooperators), which functions as indirect reciprocity. There is no evidence of explicit “you rewarded me so I reward you back” statements, but their action pattern is compatible with positive reciprocal sentiment toward cooperative and reward-giving players. At minimum, they do not reduce contributions after being rewarded, and they remain willing to incur even more reward costs, suggesting that receiving rewards reinforces rather than undermines their prosocial strategy.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey pay attention to the structure of outcomes and use that information to shape their incentives. They understand that universal contribution maximizes group returns and explicitly communicate the payoff logic to others. They notice the presence of holdouts and refer to the asymmetry where non-contributors benefit at the group’s expense (echoing another player’s point and reinforcing that understanding). They do not visibly gloat when others suffer heavy punishment or windfalls, nor do they complain when their own payoffs are substantially lower due to heavy rewarding. When large punitive cascades occur (others spending heavily to punish defectors), they do not verbally endorse or condemn them; instead, they stick to their own cooperative and reward-focused path. When a chronic low contributor repeatedly benefits while contributing little, they eventually respond with a single targeted punishment, indicating that they monitor persistent patterns, not just one-off deviations. Overall, they track who contributes, who rewards, and who punishes, and adjust their rewards (and rare punishment) to signal approval or disapproval, but they remain emotionally even-keeled and do not dramatize payoffs in chat.\n\nIn sum, this player is best described as a “cooperative rewarder with reluctant, selective punishment”: a stable, high-contribution participant who uses positive reinforcement as their main tool to support group cooperation, is willing to incur personal costs to uphold a fairness-efficient norm, and only rarely turns to punishment when other methods fail to bring persistent defectors in line.", "umap_x": 0.3753458857536316, "umap_y": -1.1226922273635864, "cluster_id": 6, "cluster_size": 31, "cluster_title": "Punishment / Reward / Contribution", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around punishment, reward, contribution, contributions, low."}
{"experiment": "3zSNGrLvJJYZhmW2p", "participant": "hTdGbCFuP3T9rYtNd", "game_finished": true, "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a predominantly self-interested, opportunistic free-rider with intermittent, low-commitment cooperation. They have a binary choice and toggle between contributing nothing and contributing the full endowment, but the modal behavior is to contribute nothing. Their cooperation is unstable: they alternate between full contribution and zero with no clear, consistent conditional rule like “match the group.” They sometimes contribute fully even when several others do not, but those episodes do not persist and do not translate into a cooperative norm. They continue to free-ride even after heavy punishment targeted at them, indicating a relatively high tolerance for social sanctions and a stronger weight on immediate private payoff than on group welfare. They understand that contributing means losing personal coins and explicitly frame the decision in loss terms. They do not adhere to strong fairness norms: they frequently benefit from others’ contributions without reciprocating, and they end the game still free-riding in the face of nearly universal cooperation by others. Overall, they behave like a payoff-focused, strategically flexible egoist who occasionally experiments with cooperation but does not internalize it as a stable norm.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThey communicate sparingly, with a light, somewhat playful tone rather than strategic seriousness. Early on, they greet others and make a role-appropriate joke, suggesting they are socially aware and comfortable with light banter. When another player asks about the downside of contributing, they respond succinctly in a purely material payoff frame, not in terms of fairness or group benefit. Later, they echo a pro-cooperation slogan that aligns with group-oriented messaging, but their actual behavior contradicts this, suggesting they use rhetoric more for social alignment or humor than as a commitment statement. At one point they misleadingly claim to “go all in each time” while actually free-riding frequently, which may reflect joking, impression management, or mild deception; intent is unknown, but they do not correct it. Near the midpoint they show mild fatigue or curiosity about game length. Their style is low-effort and non-confrontational: they do not directly criticize others, press for enforcement, or lead coordination attempts, and they largely ignore the punishment/reward discourse among others.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey never use costly punishment at any point, despite having multiple salient opportunities: others repeatedly fail to contribute, some players impose heavy sanctions, and norms get discussed explicitly. They thus reveal an essentially punishment-averse profile. This is not because they favor cooperation strongly—rather, they refrain from both norm enforcement and retaliatory behavior, even after being punished multiple times. Their non-use of punishment suggests they either do not value expressing disapproval via costly actions, or they judge the cost as not worth the potential deterrence effect. Given their consistent free-riding, a plausible interpretation is that they are focused on maintaining high net payoffs and see punishment as an inefficient expenditure. They also do not use “moralistic” punishment to defend public-goods norms even in periods when they themselves are contributing, further supporting that norm enforcement is not a goal.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nWhen they are punished, they do not change their contribution pattern in a sustained cooperative direction. After receiving a concentrated set of deductions, they continue to alternate but revert quickly to non-contribution, and they are punished again later without durable behavioral compliance. They never acknowledge the punishers in chat, do not express anger, gratitude, or puzzlement, and do not retaliate with counter-punishment. Their observable response is behavioral inertia: they keep playing their own strategy largely unaffected. This suggests low sensitivity to social sanctions and low motivation either to appease punishers or to escalate conflict. In personality terms they appear emotionally detached or pragmatic regarding punishment events; they treat deductions as part of the payoff structure rather than as social signals to be answered.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey never spend to reward others, even though several players repeatedly contribute fully and some engage in intense pro-social efforts. They do not reward high contributors or those who try to coordinate cooperation, nor do they reward their punishers or anyone who might be seen as an ally. This indicates an absence of strategic rewarding as a tool to shape others’ behavior and a general reluctance to incur personal costs for positive social signaling. Given that they frequently benefit from others’ cooperation, their non-rewarding further reinforces their free-rider profile: they accept the benefit of others’ generosity, coordination, and sanctioning without contributing to that enforcement system. There is no evidence that they even consider reward as a lever.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThey are never rewarded by others, so their direct response to being rewarded is unknown. Because they do not reward anyone themselves and do not discuss rewards in chat, there is no indirect evidence of how they would react to positive reinforcement—reciprocity, alliance-building, or indifference cannot be inferred. Confidence on their reward-related social responsiveness is therefore low.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey see detailed information about others’ payoffs, reward and punishment expenditures, and resulting deductions, yet they almost never reference these outcomes explicitly. When heavy punishment starts to hit players (including themselves), they remain behaviorally stable, indicating that seeing others’ costs and losses does not strongly shift their own strategy. They do not react with sympathy for those heavily punished, nor do they praise or condemn punishers or heavy rewarders, even when others openly question or comment on such behavior. They occasionally engage in meta-commentary about the game’s length and implicitly about its repetitive nature, but not about fairness or efficiency of outcomes. Their brief pro-cooperation slogan and later suggestion about going “all in” contrast with their actual contributions, implying that others’ cooperative outcomes do not induce genuine imitation, only surface-level rhetorical alignment. Overall, they observe others’ outcomes but appear to treat them more as background information than as cues to update norms or strategies, maintaining a payoff-oriented, low-engagement stance.", "umap_x": 0.49988847970962524, "umap_y": -0.9247300624847412, "cluster_id": 6, "cluster_size": 31, "cluster_title": "Punishment / Reward / Contribution", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around punishment, reward, contribution, contributions, low."}
{"experiment": "3zSNGrLvJJYZhmW2p", "participant": "kbxi5o3HFQXMGo5oX", "game_finished": true, "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a highly stable, unconditional full contributor. They always contribute the maximum allowed amount and never defect, even when many others free‑ride and when they themselves are repeatedly punished. Their behavior indicates a strong intrinsic norm in favor of full cooperation rather than a contingent, tit‑for‑tat style. They tolerate consistently low personal payoffs and repeated exploitation without adjusting their contribution level downward. They explicitly frame the situation as a team effort and persist in cooperative behavior even when expressing frustration or “giving up,” suggesting that “giving up” refers to giving up on persuading others, not to abandoning cooperation. Risk tolerance is high: they accept substantial payoff risk and repeated negative outcomes in order to uphold the cooperative norm.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThey communicate in a friendly, upbeat, and group‑oriented tone, using light humor and inclusive language. Early on, they greet others and later repeatedly encourage everyone to contribute fully, using clear, normative appeals and simple slogans. They actively try to coordinate behavior, praising improvement and calling the group a team. They respond to others’ comments (e.g., about the structure of the game or cooperation) and reinforce pro‑cooperation messages from others. When cooperation falters, they express disappointment and fatigue but remain civil; their frustration is directed at the situation, not at specific individuals. They continue to voice hope and encouragement even after long exposure to free‑riding, which suggests persistence and a prosocial, engagement‑oriented style rather than withdrawal or cynicism.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey almost never use punishment and appear reluctant to spend on it despite many opportunities and clear free‑riding. The one time they do punish, it targets a salient, repeat non‑contributor who has openly disparaged the game. This suggests that their threshold for punishment is high and tied to perceived persistent noncooperation plus a negative attitude toward the collective effort. The punishment seems closer to norm enforcement than spite: they do not follow up with more punishment, they do not broaden punishment to other low contributors, and they do not escalate after being punished themselves. They never use punishment for retaliation when they are personally targeted by others’ deductions; they do not adopt a “you hit me, I hit you” stance. Deterrence value appears secondary to their general preference for positive coordination and rewards.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nThey are punished multiple times by identifiable others but show no direct retaliation and no visible behavioral concession. They continue to contribute fully and continue to speak cooperatively after being punished. They do not confront or call out the punishers in chat, nor do they shift to punishing those who targeted them. Their reaction is essentially non‑reactive: no visible anger, no attempt to negotiate, no attempt to curry favor by lowering contributions or changing strategy. This indicates a forgiving or at least non‑vengeful orientation, and a separation between their own cooperative norm and how others treat them. Whether they internally register the punishment as unfair is unknown; what is clear is that it does not alter their cooperative behavior.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey use rewards moderately and selectively, with an apparent emphasis on recognizing cooperative or supportive behavior rather than building strict, payoff‑maximizing incentives. For most of the game they refrain from rewarding despite contribution differences, which suggests caution about spending. When they do reward, it usually targets consistent cooperators or players making positive contributions to the group effort (either through contributions or perhaps through ongoing support), and occasionally appears aimed at reinforcing others late in the game when cooperation is fragile. They do not appear to use rewards in a systematic “if you contribute this round, I’ll reward you” contract; instead, rewards function as appreciation and moral support. Their late‑game willingness to spend a large fraction of a round’s payoff on multiple rewards, even after a long game, shows sustained prosocial motivation and a willingness to incur personal cost to encourage or thank others.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThey receive repeated rewards across the game from several others. There is no evidence that they try to reciprocate directly to specific rewarders (for example, they do not clearly single them out with rewards in return). Nor do they explicitly thank rewarders in chat. Instead, they seem to respond by maintaining high cooperation and continuing to encourage the group as a whole. Their reciprocity is thus diffuse and group‑directed rather than dyadic: they “repay” being rewarded by persevering in prosocial actions and cooperative messaging, not by favor trading. Whether they consciously track who has rewarded them is unknown, but their observable behavior does not shift toward preferential treatment of particular individuals.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey show awareness of the group’s outcome patterns, commenting when contributions improve or deteriorate and urging joint action when total contributions fall. They react positively when more players contribute fully, praising the group’s performance and expressing hope. When free‑riding persists or reappears, they express discouragement and some emotional fatigue, including talk of “giving up,” but they do not translate this into defection or punishment campaigns. They do not explicitly reference others’ payoffs, punishment expenditures, or reward totals, though they implicitly recognize that non‑contributors benefit at the group’s expense when echoing or supporting such points in chat. They acknowledge the difficulty and length of the game but remain engaged and cooperative to the end.

{"experiment": "3zSNGrLvJJYZhmW2p", "participant": "nyi8ePouSTATiREKQ", "game_finished": true, "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a near-pure free-rider who nonetheless endorses high-contribution norms for others. Across the game they overwhelmingly keep their full endowment rather than contributing, only switching to full contribution once and immediately reverting back to zero afterward. Their contribution pattern is highly stable (almost always zero), not noisy. They clearly understand that full contribution by everyone is collectively efficient and explicitly advocate that norm, yet they do not personally follow it except once. Their lone contribution appears driven by momentary alignment with an optimistic cooperator rather than a stable change in strategy. They show no sign of conditional cooperation (e.g., “I’ll contribute if everyone else does”); instead, they routinely free-ride even when almost everyone else is contributing. This indicates low willingness to sacrifice personal payoff for the group, combined with a readiness to let others bear the cost of cooperation. Risk tolerance is mixed: they are willing to spend on punishment and reward (sometimes heavily), but they are not willing to risk foregone private payoff by contributing.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThey communicate actively, with a sociable and light tone. They greet others, ask clarifying questions about the mechanism, and answer others’ procedural questions. They openly discuss the strategic structure of the game, including the downside of contributing and the fact that non-contributors personally benefit at the group’s expense. They repeatedly encourage “everyone” to contribute and praise the group when contributions rise, framing contribution as a team effort and aligning verbally with the most pro-cooperation player. Their persuasion style is soft and upbeat rather than confrontational; they use humor and playful comments even when acknowledging tension (e.g., speaking up being “dangerous,” or joking after a bad cooperative outcome). They also explain their own and others’ use of punishment as a way to indicate disagreement, suggesting they think in terms of expressive signaling rather than pure payoff maximization. They respond to others’ frustration (about length of game or “stupid game”) with questions about enjoyment and with gentle attempts to keep morale and coordination going. Overall, they engage actively, try to coordinate norms, and maintain a friendly, somewhat ironic tone even while free-riding.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey are willing to punish, and do so selectively and non-randomly. They target clear low contributors who persistently do not “go all in” when many others are contributing. Their punishment is not constant; they refrain for many rounds, then deploy it in bursts when group cooperation is relatively high but a few players remain as holdouts. This pattern suggests norm-enforcement motives: they use punishment to pressure consistent defectors and express disapproval of free-riding. They explicitly frame punishment (more generally) as a way to indicate disagreement, supporting the idea that for them it is partly symbolic and normative rather than purely instrumental. They also punish specific players multiple times over the game, particularly those who repeatedly fail to contribute in mostly cooperative environments, consistent with targeting chronic defectors rather than punishing randomly. However, they themselves free-ride almost the entire game; this creates a hypocrisy gap: they enforce contribution norms on others that they do not follow. This makes their punishment more consistent with second-order norm talk than with sincere first-order cooperation. They do not visibly use punishment for retaliation over being punished; their targets appear selected based on contribution behavior, not on who punished them.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nThey are punished multiple times over the game, including some substantial deductions, but they never acknowledge this directly in chat, never complain about being punished, and never ask who did it. They show no sign of retaliatory punishment toward likely punishers, and do not change their contribution behavior in a pro-social direction after being punished; they continue to free-ride almost every round and only contribute once, after substantial history of punishment. That single contribution is more tightly aligned with a positive cooperative message from another player than with immediate punishment history, so compliance with punishers’ signals seems weak at best. Emotionally, they appear relatively thick-skinned or detached: they maintain a joking, upbeat tone despite repeated targeted deductions. They also do not try to bargain with punishers or defend their behavior. Overall, they respond to punishment with behavioral stubbornness (continuing to free-ride), no visible retaliation, and no explicit emotional protest.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey are quite willing to spend on reward, including making sizable multi-person reward allocations that significantly reduce their own payoff. They reward high contributors and especially vocal cooperators, apparently to reinforce pro-social behavior and maintain morale. Their rewards target players who repeatedly contribute or advocate cooperation, and sometimes those who continue to contribute even while discouraged. They occasionally reward several players simultaneously, indicating a desire to broadly recognize cooperative behavior rather than form a narrow alliance. The timing and pattern of rewards suggest they use them as positive reinforcement for pro-group actions and as a way to encourage continued teamwork, despite their own minimal contributions. They also at times appear to reward in a way that stabilizes the group narrative (thanking or supporting the players who keep “holding out hope”). Their reward decisions are not obviously contingent on personal benefit or future reciprocation; they often give reward in situations where it is unlikely to be paid back materially. This reflects a willingness to use reward as expressive support for norms and group members, even at a cost, while still keeping their contribution level low.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThey receive rewards a number of times, especially when they themselves continue not to contribute. They do not explicitly thank any specific rewarder by name, but they do respond in a way that broadly aligns with those players’ cooperative messaging: they echo calls for everyone to contribute, praise group improvements, and reward some of the same high-contributing players that others reward. This suggests indirect reciprocity rather than direct tit-for-tat: they do not seem to repay rewarders one-to-one, but they support the general pro-cooperation coalition through positive language and their own rewards. They never use being rewarded as a cue to start contributing themselves (except for a single late cooperative round, which is not clearly tied to receiving reward rather than to ongoing encouragement by a particular cooperator). They appear comfortable taking rewards while continuing to free-ride, showing low guilt or obligation to reciprocate via contribution. In terms of social stance, they treat being rewarded as reinforcement that they are part of the group, not as a binding commitment to change behavior.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey pay attention to others’ contributions and outcomes and periodically comment on the group’s overall performance. They clearly understand that universal contribution increases total group payoff and that non-contributors personally gain at the expense of cooperators; they explicitly articulate this structure. They also make evaluative comments when contribution levels rise (“getting there,” “great job”) and when they fall (“spoke too soon”), tracking whether the group is approaching full cooperation. They treat heavy use of punishment as a signal of disagreement with others’ strategies, and expect to see more punishment when behavior diverges from group norms. They also engage with others’ meta-attitudes toward the game (e.g., someone calling it stupid, others complaining about duration), responding with questions about fun and with continued encouragement to “work as a team.” They do not comment in detail on specific payoff numbers, but they are aware that holdouts and defectors are getting higher private payoffs and openly label that pattern as benefiting at the group’s expense. Overall, they interpret others’ outcomes and actions through a norm-focused, narrative lens: who is trying for the group, who is giving up, and how signals like punishment and reward express approval or disapproval, even while their own material strategy remains largely free-riding.", "umap_x": 0.438530296087265, "umap_y": -0.6104593276977539, "cluster_id": 4, "cluster_size": 43, "cluster_title": "Punishment / Contribution / Reward", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around punishment, contribution, reward, cooperation, behavior."}
{"experiment": "3zSNGrLvJJYZhmW2p", "participant": "pZ23AK9eSGXF7kbub", "game_finished": true, "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThe player is a mixed, somewhat erratic conditional cooperator with a clear self-interested streak. They alternate between full free-riding and full contribution rather than following a single stable norm. They sometimes match or support high group contribution levels, especially when many others are also contributing, but they also repeatedly exploit cooperative phases by keeping their entire endowment when others continue to invest. Their pattern does not stabilize into either “always contribute” or “always defect”; instead they oscillate, suggesting limited commitment to any fixed fairness norm. They show no evidence of risk aversion in the narrow sense (they are willing to “risk” contributing when others may not), but they are consistently willing to take the safer, individually profitable free-rider option even after having cooperated earlier. Their behavior is consistent with a “pragmatic opportunist”: they tolerate contributing when cooperation is salient or socially pushed, but they revert to defection when that pressure weakens or when defecting is easy to hide within a partially cooperative group.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThey communicate sparsely and in a light, almost flippant tone. Their only proactive group-facing message is a joke about being drunk, which does not attempt to coordinate behavior, build norms, or discuss the game structure. They do not answer others’ questions about rules or rounds, do not join in explicit coordination attempts (“everyone contribute,” “work as a team”), and do not comment on fairness, punishment, or strategy even when others discuss these issues explicitly. This combination suggests low engagement with norm-enforcement dialogue and little interest in persuasion or leadership. Socially, they appear detached and somewhat playful, prioritizing casual banter over substantive cooperation talk. Responsiveness to others’ chat content is effectively absent beyond timing their joke while others are greeting each other.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey never use the punishment mechanism, despite repeated opportunities and despite clear, visible free-riding by several others. Even when there are obvious norm violators (relative to the emerging “all in” appeals from others), the player abstains from sanctioning. This suggests a strong reluctance to incur personal costs for the sake of enforcing cooperation. It is unclear whether this is driven by principled opposition to punishment, indifference to fairness, or a simple desire to avoid spending coins on others’ behavior; the transcript does not provide explicit justification, so the motive is unknown. There is no indication of retaliatory tendencies or strategic use of punishment as deterrence: they neither punish chronic defectors nor those who might harm their payoffs indirectly. Overall, they behave as a pure non-punisher.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nThey are never punished, so their behavioral and emotional response to being sanctioned is unknown. They also do not verbally react to punishers targeting others, even when large, costly punishments occur and become a salient topic in chat. They neither criticize nor praise punishers in the conversation. As a result, their stance toward punishers—whether resentful, approving, or indifferent—remains unknown, and there is no evidence of either compliance with punishment norms or retaliatory instincts.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey never spend any coins on rewarding others, even when several players very clearly and repeatedly contribute fully and some players are visibly trying to organize full cooperation. This indicates either low willingness to pay for positive reinforcement or a narrow payoff focus that avoids any generosity not immediately required by the game. There is no sign that they attempt to strategically use reward to sustain high-contribution equilibria or to build alliances with consistent cooperators. Their refusal to reward holds even in periods when they themselves are contributing, implying that their occasional cooperation is not paired with any desire to reinforce similar behavior in others.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThey receive rewards multiple times from others, including when they are free-riding as well as when they are contributing, but they never mention these gifts in chat and never reciprocate with rewards of their own. They do not visibly adjust their contribution pattern in a way that clearly responds to being rewarded; their contributions remain mixed rather than shifting toward consistent cooperation or alliance with specific rewarders. This suggests that they treat incoming rewards as windfalls rather than cues to form cooperative bonds. They show no observable gratitude signaling (verbal thanks) or material reciprocity (counter-reward), so their interpersonal responsiveness to kindness is low or at least not expressed in this setting.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey appear largely indifferent to others’ payoffs, punishment expenditures, and reward flows. While other participants openly discuss the logic of contributing, the impact of holdouts, and the reasons for punishment, this player stays silent about all of it. They do not comment on people burning coins on large punishments or on players spending heavily on rewards, even when this substantially affects group payoffs. Their own contribution pattern does not clearly track any single other’s outcome or treatment: they do not, for example, increase cooperation in sympathy with punished cooperators, nor do they defect in response to visible exploitation. Any belief they hold about the game’s fairness or efficiency is therefore unknown. Behaviorally, they act as if others’ detailed outcomes and sanctioning decisions are peripheral to their own simple choice rule: sometimes contribute, sometimes keep everything, without public reflection on the social consequences.", "umap_x": 0.6224170923233032, "umap_y": -0.3527814447879791, "cluster_id": 4, "cluster_size": 43, "cluster_title": "Punishment / Contribution / Reward", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around punishment, contribution, reward, cooperation, behavior."}

They contribute fully in most rounds and only occasionally keep everything for themselves. These few zero-contribution choices do not appear to be retaliatory; they occur even when others are mostly contributing and are paired with generous rewards, suggesting experimentation or temporary self-interest rather than a shift to exploitation. Overall, they behave as a “quasi-unconditional cooperator”: they keep contributing even when some group members free-ride and even late in the game when others start contributing less. Their behavior suggests they prioritize group welfare and norm-consistency over short-term payoff maximization. They appear tolerant of inequality and do not sharply condition their contribution on specific others’ actions; they keep cooperating in the presence of both high and low contributors.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThey speak very little and avoid strategic talk about contributions or sanctions. Their early chat focuses on interface issues and a brief social response about not being drunk, with no attempts to coordinate contribution or sanction norms. They neither publicly praise nor criticize particular players’ behaviors, and do not use chat to threaten punishment or to lobby for group-wide cooperation. When others debate the meaning of the game, punishment, or “giving up,” they remain silent. This suggests a low-visibility, low-conflict communication style: they engage minimally, respond when directly relevant (e.g., clarifying interface or answering a casual question), but do not lead or steer group norms through words. Their cooperative and prosocial stance is expressed almost entirely through contributions and rewards rather than verbal persuasion.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey never use punishment, despite extensive opportunities and despite clear examples of others punishing both defectors and sometimes cooperators. They refrain from punishing chronic low contributors as well as people who punish or talk negatively about the game. This indicates a strong reluctance to impose losses on others, even when doing so might be instrumentally effective or socially endorsed. Their pattern is consistent with an “anti-punisher” or “pure positive enforcement” type: they prefer to shape behavior through rewards, not sanctions. There is no evidence they ever consider punishment as a retaliatory tool, a fairness correction, or a deterrent.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nThey are never directly punished in this game, so their behavioral response to being punished is unknown. Because they do not punish anyone at any point, including heavy punishers, we do not see retaliatory punishment. Their continued high contribution in an environment where punishment is active suggests that, if they were to be punished, they would be more likely to maintain or even over-compensate in cooperation rather than escalate conflict—but this is speculation and should be treated as low confidence. Overall, their response to punishers is behaviorally neutral and non-retaliatory: they do not adjust their contribution or sanctioning in any observable way in relation to who punishes whom.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey are an extremely active rewarder and use rewards broadly and generously throughout the game, often at substantial personal cost. Rewarding is not narrowly targeted; they reward both consistent high contributors and, at times, players whose contributions are low or ambiguous. Their pattern suggests several motives:\n- They consistently reward clear cooperators, reinforcing high contributions.\n- They sometimes reward players who are being punished or who appear disadvantaged, which looks like support or compensation rather than strict reciprocity.\n- They also occasionally reward players who are not obviously cooperative at that moment, implying a generalized prosocial or goodwill motive rather than purely strategic reinforcement.\nThey frequently accept negative or very low round payoffs to give rewards, indicating they place significant weight on others’ outcomes or on signaling kindness, even when it is individually costly. They never combine reward with punishment, further emphasizing a one-sided, positive-sum approach to social control.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThey are rewarded multiple times by others, but they never explicitly acknowledge or reciprocate to specific rewarders in chat. Behaviorally, they continue high contributions and continue to reward others throughout, including players who reward them and many who do not. Their reward pattern is not clearly contingent on having been rewarded themselves; they do not form visible bilateral “alliances” through reciprocal reward loops. Instead, they maintain a diffuse, group-wide rewarding pattern that is only partly aligned with who has rewarded them. This suggests they appreciate rewards implicitly (in the sense that they continue cooperative behavior) but are not strongly driven by direct reciprocity to individual benefactors. Their style aligns more with generalized reciprocity or unconditional prosociality than dyadic tit-for-tat.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey observe that some players spend heavily on punishment and others receive large deductions, yet they do not react verbally or via punishment. Instead, they frequently respond via rewards—often to those they may see as cooperative, supportive, or unfairly targeted. They do not comment on payoff differences or complain about those earning more by free-riding; they also do not exploit opportunities to join sanctioning cascades. They tolerate others’ negative talk about the game without apparent change in their own cooperative stance. When others question the point of punishment or the game itself, they neither defend nor attack these positions. Their behavioral response to the overall outcome structure is to keep contributing and to channel resources into positive reinforcement rather than correcting inequities through punishment or adjusting their own contribution sharply. Overall, they appear robustly prosocial, low-conflict, and more concerned with sustaining a cooperative atmosphere than with enforcing strict fairness or maximizing their own payoff.", "umap_x": 0.590130627155304, "umap_y": -0.9741232395172119, "cluster_id": 6, "cluster_size": 31, "cluster_title": "Punishment / Reward / Contribution", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around punishment, reward, contribution, contributions, low."}

They are willing to contribute the full endowment repeatedly even though the marginal per‑coin return is below 1, indicating they tolerate personal sacrifice for group efficiency. After beginning with two free-ride choices, they shift into a long stretch of full contributions and only intermittently revert to zero in later periods. Their contributions are sensitive to perceived group behavior: they explicitly state that universal cooperation is required for the strategy to “work,” and they continue contributing even when some others hold out, suggesting a norm-driven rather than purely payoff-maximizing motivation. Still, they do sometimes defect (choose 0) when free-riding by others is salient or when the game has dragged on, implying limits to their altruism and some responsiveness to fatigue or perceived futility. Overall, they follow a “cooperate by default, occasionally defect when others persistently under-contribute or when endgame/fatigue seems likely” pattern.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThe player communicates rarely but purposefully. Their tone is polite and neutral; they greet others and later make a single, clear, explanatory remark about the logic of mutual cooperation, which aligns with their cooperative play. They do not scold, threaten, or moralize; instead, they frame cooperation as a conditional collective benefit, emphasizing that everyone would need to join in. This indicates a mild, non-confrontational attempt at coordination rather than active leadership. They respond to the emerging discussion about contributions but do not engage in extended back-and-forth or emotional commentary, suggesting a low-visibility, cognitively engaged but socially reserved style. They do not comment on punishment or reward behavior despite seeing substantial use by others, indicating either disinterest, conflict aversion, or a focus on their own contribution decisions rather than meta-discussion of enforcement.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThe player never uses punishment, despite multiple salient opportunities (clear low contributors, vocal “dark side” talk, and evident free-riding). This consistent non-use suggests either a strong reluctance to incur costs to harm others or a belief that punishment is inefficient or normatively inappropriate in this setting. Because they do sometimes defect themselves, the abstention from punishment does not stem from a strict “moral perfectionist” stance; rather, it appears grounded in either cost–benefit skepticism or a desire to avoid antagonism. There is no evidence of retaliatory motives or of “teaching” behavior through sanctions. They thus fit a “non-punishing cooperator” profile: they rely on voluntary coordination rather than coercive enforcement, even when others use punishment heavily.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nThe player is never punished, so their direct behavioral or emotional response to identified punishers is unknown. They nonetheless observe repeated punishment patterns in the group without commenting or adjusting their own strategy in any obvious, punishment-driven way, suggesting that, if they were to be punished in a future game, they might interpret it more as noise or others’ preferences than as a cue for retaliation or compliance. However, this is speculative; actual response to personal punishment is unknown/low confidence.\n\n<REWARD>\nThe player never uses rewards, despite contributing heavily and witnessing others deploy reward to encourage cooperation. This indicates that, although they value group cooperation, they are not willing to pay for explicit positive reinforcement. Given the relatively poor “exchange rate” of reward and their own cooperative norm, this likely reflects a cost-conscious or principle-based reluctance to buy goodwill. They instead “reward” others only indirectly by continuing to contribute when many do the same. There is no sign of strategic alliance-building via rewards or of gratitude signaling in the enforcement stage; enforcement decisions are entirely inactive for them.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThe player is rewarded on a couple of occasions but does not alter their enforcement behavior (they still never reward or punish) and does not acknowledge the rewarders in chat. Their contribution pattern remains broadly similar to what it was before rewards appeared, suggesting that receiving rewards neither induces stronger cooperation (they were already mostly cooperating) nor triggers reciprocal rewarding. This points to a relatively low sensitivity to strategic gift-exchange: they continue to play according to their own cooperation norm rather than forming dyadic alliances or engaging in reciprocal reward cycles. Socially, they appear to treat rewards as incidental, not as a relationship cue.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThe player clearly reads and cognitively processes the outcome structure and others’ behaviors. Their one substantive content message about cooperation demonstrates understanding that unilateral contribution is exploitable and that the social optimum requires universal buy-in. They observe ongoing punishment, reward, and uneven payoffs but do not comment on fairness of specific individuals or express anger or praise at others’ choices. Their contribution choices show some adaptation to group patterns: they continue to cooperate when many are contributing and occasionally take advantage of high-contribution environments by defecting, which implies a recognition of free-rider gains. They do not visibly react to extreme behaviors (heavy punishers, obsessive rewarders) in either enforcement or chat, suggesting emotional restraint and a somewhat detached, analytical stance. Overall, they respond to others’ outcomes primarily through modest adjustments in their own contribution level, not through expressive communication or enforcement actions.", "umap_x": 0.8434247970581055, "umap_y": -0.5503152012825012, "cluster_id": 6, "cluster_size": 31, "cluster_title": "Punishment / Reward / Contribution", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around punishment, reward, contribution, contributions, low."}
{"experiment": "3zSNGrLvJJYZhmW2p", "participant": "zJd7D32NZfC6rjKSJ", "game_finished": true, "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a near-pure free-rider with one brief deviation toward cooperation. When given an all-or-nothing choice, they overwhelmingly keep their entire endowment and take the group return, regardless of others’ high contribution levels or repeated pro-cooperation appeals. They initially explore whether partial contributions are possible and, once they understand it is binary, they mostly stick to taking everything. Their single full-contribution instance occurs immediately after others explicitly argue that the group would be better off if everyone contributed and after they have already been free-riding; they then quickly revert to non-contribution even as most others continue cooperating. This suggests they understand the social optimum but prioritize personal payoff and low effort, not fairness or reciprocity. Their choices are very stable over time, with minimal sensitivity to punishment, social pressure, or the evolving contribution pattern. Risk tolerance regarding being punished appears high: they keep defecting even after being targeted with costly deductions multiple times.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThey communicate sparsely, mostly about interface and meta-game aspects rather than strategy. Early on, they comment on not seeing UI elements and ask whether the all-or-nothing contribution constraint is correct, showing some initial confusion but also a basic desire to understand the mechanism. Later, they state that they contribute all they can right after their lone cooperative choice, which functions more as a brief self-presentation than as an attempt to coordinate. They openly agree with another player’s negative assessment of the game and later characterize the experience as mostly mechanical clicking and holding, and as excessively long. They also question the rationale for spending to punish, indicating low valuation of norm-enforcement for its own sake. Overall, their tone is mildly detached and pragmatic, with no sustained attempt to persuade others, build a coalition, or push for a contribution norm.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey never use punishment, despite being punished themselves multiple times and observing others use costly punishment both against defectors and against perceived norm violators. Their single explicit statement about it questions why anyone would pay to deduct others, indicating they see punishment as irrational or wasteful from their perspective. There is no evidence they consider punishment as a tool for group coordination or fairness; they seem to treat it strictly as a personal cost with no sufficient private benefit. They do not retaliate against those who punish them, even when punishers are clearly identifiable. This suggests a type that is unwilling to incur costs for either retribution or norm enforcement, and that is largely indifferent to using sanctioning systems strategically.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nWhen punished, they do not change their contribution behavior toward greater cooperation; they continue to free-ride consistently. They also do not comment on being personally punished, show no overt emotional reaction, and do not attempt to confront or persuade punishers. The only related remark is a general question about why anyone would pay to deduct others, which reads as a detached critique rather than a plea or threat. They never attempt counter-punishment or public shaming of punishers, and they do not show compliance with the cooperative norm emerging in the group. Overall, they appear resistant to behavioral change under punishment and largely non-reactive at the social level.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey almost never spend on reward, but they do make a single, modest use of it, targeting two consistently cooperative players with a small positive transfer. This occurs immediately after they verbally question punishment, suggesting a weak preference for positive reinforcement (reward) over negative enforcement (punishment) when they do engage. However, this is a one-off action; they do not persist with reward as an ongoing strategy to stabilize cooperation or to build alliances. The pattern suggests they conceptually distinguish between “pointless” punishment and slightly more acceptable reward, but that even reward is not worth repeated personal cost. They are not using reward as a calculated long-term investment; it appears more like a sporadic gesture acknowledging others’ efforts.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThey receive rewards multiple times, including sizable amounts, yet show no observable behavioral shift toward contributing and offer no explicit thanks or reciprocal actions. They neither begin to reward their benefactors systematically, nor alter their own contributions in the direction of the rewarders’ norm. The one time they reward others does not clearly map onto immediate past rewards directed at them in a way that indicates direct reciprocity; it appears more like a general nod to cooperative players rather than a targeted “you rewarded me, I reward you” response. This indicates low reciprocity and low inclination to treat reward as the basis for alliances or mutual support.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey clearly notice that others are spending substantial amounts on both punishment and reward, and they explicitly question the logic of paying to deduct others. They acknowledge that the game is long and tedious, commenting on duration and the mechanical nature of repeated clicking, implying that they track time and are sensitive to the personal cost in effort. They do not explicitly comment on specific individuals’ payoffs or sanctioning patterns, and they do not appeal to fairness when they benefit disproportionately from others’ cooperation. Their single cooperative statement about contributing everything frames their own move rather than responding to the fact that others are being exploited. Overall, they treat others’ outcomes and sanctioning as environmental noise rather than as signals that should guide their own strategic or moral stance.\n\n---\n\nType label (implicit in the above): This player is a low-engagement, payoff-focused free-rider who mildly prefers reward over punishment in principle, but who is largely unresponsive to social incentives and norm signals, and who quickly disengages once the game feels long or tedious.", "umap_x": 0.4615490436553955, "umap_y": -0.6885452270507812, "cluster_id": 4, "cluster_size": 43, "cluster_title": "Punishment / Contribution / Reward", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around punishment, contribution, reward, cooperation, behavior."}
{"experiment": "4Menw33JLbdtzSvug", "participant": "7m8GgZcSDPpiGtu7Q", "game_finished": true, "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a stable, unconditional full cooperator. They always contribute their entire endowment, regardless of how others behave, even when some group members give very little or clearly free‑ride. They do not adjust downward in response to low contributions, nor upward in response to higher ones, indicating that they follow a fixed internal rule rather than conditionally matching peers. They tolerate inequity in both directions: they keep cooperating when others earn more through rewards they themselves do not seek, and they keep cooperating when defectors obtain higher immediate payoffs. They appear focused on maximizing group efficiency and are willing to forgo personal coins every round without experimenting with more self‑interested choices. Their risk tolerance for being exploited is high; they do not hedge or “test” others by reducing contributions. Their fairness norm seems to be “everyone should fully cooperate,” but they do not personally deviate from this ideal even when that norm is not universally followed.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nAwareness of the finite horizon does not erode their cooperation. They maintain identical, maximal contributions through the entire game, including the final rounds. There is no visible end‑game unraveling on their part; they do not attempt last‑minute profit‑taking or strategic defection. The only strategic shift near the end is the introduction of one targeted punishment when cooperation visibly drops for a subset of players, but this does not translate into any reduction in their own contributions. Their horizon awareness seems to manifest, at most, in a modest willingness to sanction near the end, not in any willingness to slacken their own cooperative effort. Overall, they behave as if norms or principles override backward‑induction logic.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey almost never punish; across the entire interaction they impose punishment exactly once. That single act is selective and aimed at a clear low contributor relative to the rest of the active group, suggesting a norm‑enforcing motive rather than indiscriminate hostility. They ignore earlier and more persistent free‑riding by another player for many rounds, which indicates a strong reluctance to use costly sanctions even when exploitation is obvious. When they finally do punish, it coincides with visible under‑contribution as cooperation starts to deteriorate late in the game, consistent with a threshold model: they tolerate deviations for a long time, then intervene minimally when norm‑breaking threatens group standards. The lack of any apparent retaliation for having been punished or rewarded by others (unknown due to anonymity) and the single, norm‑aligned target support an interpretation of them as a very restrained, primarily deterrence‑oriented punisher with a high activation threshold. Their overall propensity to punish is low.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey never spend on rewards, despite often being surrounded by high or full cooperators and seeing others actively reward peers. They thus do not engage in positive reciprocity through this mechanism, even though rewarding is less efficient than contributing but can still incentivize cooperative norms. This consistent non‑use suggests one of: (i) they view direct cooperation via contributions as sufficient and more important than incentivizing others with side‑payments, (ii) they are conservative about spending on any “extra” social tools beyond contributions, or (iii) they are uncertain about how to use rewards effectively and prefer inaction. Given that they do accept the cost of punishment once, their avoidance of rewards appears deliberate rather than a blanket refusal to spend post‑stage resources. Overall, they rely on their own cooperative example and extremely rare punishment rather than on active positive reinforcement.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey observe a rich pattern of peer payoffs, punishments, and rewards, but respond very weakly behaviorally. They do not mimic others’ sanctioning styles: they ignore repeated instances of some players being punished or rewarded and do not join in “piling on,” nor do they compensate those who have borne costs to help the group. They also do not attempt to exploit or counter‑exploit by adjusting contributions in light of who is gaining from rewards or losing from punishment; their contributions remain fixed. The late, isolated punishment suggests they attend to outcome information enough to notice when someone under‑contributes relative to a high‑cooperation norm and is not fully corrected by existing behavior, then intervene once. However, they do not systematically track or respond to who is earning more or less than them, showing little concern with relative payoff ranking. Their primary reaction pattern to others’ outcomes is stoic: they maintain their own cooperative standard almost regardless of others’ gains, losses, or sanctioning behavior, stepping in with minimal punishment only when norm violations become especially salient. Overall, they appear principled, strongly cooperation‑oriented, and highly tolerant of both reward dispersion and earlier free‑riding, with low but nonzero sensitivity to breakdowns in group norms.", "umap_x": 0.1766604781150818, "umap_y": -1.0652668476104736, "cluster_id": 4, "cluster_size": 43, "cluster_title": "Punishment / Contribution / Reward", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around punishment, contribution, reward, cooperation, behavior."}
{"experiment": "4Menw33JLbdtzSvug", "participant": "ECyY6RJL7xsZmJcZy", "game_finished": true, "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a very high, near-unconditional cooperator. They routinely give the full endowment, with only minor deviations at the very beginning and very end. Their behavior is stable across most of the game and does not react strongly to others’ minor deviations or to the presence of a persistent very low contributor. They appear to adopt a norm of “everyone should give essentially everything” and personally follow it even when it is not strictly payoff-maximizing given others’ behavior.\n\nThey show some sensitivity to the environment: they slightly over-contribute relative to the group once, and later slightly under-contribute in the final round while still remaining above the group average. This suggests they are not purely mechanical or blindly cooperative; rather, they prioritize high cooperation but allow small, cautious adjustments. Their risk attitude toward cooperation is pro-social and optimistic: they keep contributing fully even after seeing clear free-riding and significant use of punishment and reward by others, indicating a willingness to bear personal risk to sustain the public good.\n\nConditioning on others’ behavior is weak. Sustained full contributions by most others likely help maintain their own high cooperation, but they do not meaningfully cut back when one peer consistently gives almost nothing or when others start to vary contributions. Any fairness concern they have does not translate into strong conditionality in contributions; they continue to act as a high contributor despite inequities in effort and payoff.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThe player is aware of the game horizon and exhibits a modest end-game effect. For most of the game, they maintain the same high contribution regardless of remaining rounds. Only in the final round do they reduce their contribution, and even then they still contribute a substantial amount and remain more cooperative than the typical group member.\n\nThis pattern suggests a weak form of rational end-game adjustment layered on top of a cooperative baseline. They do not exploit the final rounds aggressively, even when others have begun to lower contributions or engage in targeted incentives. Their behavior fits a type that values consistency and cooperative identity over pure last-round payoff maximization, with only a slight nod toward the logic of “this is the last chance to keep something for myself.”\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThe player never uses punishment, even when there is a clear and repeated free-rider and when some others impose costly deductions. This consistent abstention indicates either a principled aversion to harming others, a belief that punishment is not their role, or a judgment that the cost of imposing deductions is not worth it. Because they do not test punishment at all, it is unknown whether they believe it is ineffective, unfair, or simply distasteful.\n\nThey also do not engage in second-order punishment or retaliation; when others experience large deductions or expend significant amounts punishing others, this player does not respond by punishing anyone. Their non-use holds both when they are treated favorably (receiving rewards) and when group-level norms are violated (persistent very low contribution by one player). This suggests a temperament that leans away from confrontational norm enforcement and toward either tolerance, resignation, or reliance on others to handle sanctioning.\n\nOverall, they function as a non-sanctioning cooperator: they contribute a lot but do not invest in deterring defectors.\n\n<REWARD>\nThe player never uses reward, even though they are surrounded by many high contributors and repeatedly see others investing heavily in rewards. They do receive rewards multiple times but do not reciprocate by rewarding anyone in return. This indicates that gratitude, if present, does not translate into costly positive incentives. Their strategy appears to separate their own cooperative contribution choice from any additional, costly reinforcement of others’ behavior.\n\nGiven that rewarding is less efficient than contributing directly to the public good and that they are already contributing near-maximally, they may implicitly view the reward mechanism as unnecessary or wasteful relative to direct contribution. However, this is speculative; their motives for not rewarding remain unknown. What is clear is that their cooperative type is “direct contributor only”: they help the group via contributions but abstain from meta-level interventions such as rewards or punishments.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThe player observes substantial variation in others’ outcomes: some players frequently reward, some occasionally punish, one consistently contributes almost nothing yet earns high payoffs, and several peers maintain high contributions throughout. Despite this, the player’s own behavior remains remarkably stable. They do not appear to imitate high users of reward, join in punishing low contributors, or reduce their contributions in protest of perceived unfairness.\n\nWhen they personally benefit from others’ rewards, they do not change their own strategy—neither by increasing contributions (which are already near-maximal) nor by starting to reward others. When others spend heavily on incentives and see their own payoffs reduced as a result, this player does not adjust in a way that suggests they are trying to exploit those incentive providers; they simply continue their cooperative pattern.\n\nTheir muted behavioral response to others’ costs, sanctions, and windfalls suggests a type that is guided primarily by an internal cooperative rule rather than by fine-grained, reactive updating based on outcomes. They notice that mechanisms are being used (evident in the payoff structures shown), but they do not join or counteract those efforts. In social terms, they behave as a steady, non-interventionist cooperator: contributing reliably, tolerating both free-riding and active sanctioning by others, and keeping their own strategy largely unchanged in the face of others’ diverse actions and earnings.", "umap_x": 0.27529945969581604, "umap_y": -0.49852797389030457, "cluster_id": 4, "cluster_size": 43, "cluster_title": "Punishment / Contribution / Reward", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around punishment, contribution, reward, cooperation, behavior."}
{"experiment": "4Menw33JLbdtzSvug", "participant": "FKuMFB4zi8ekBPnZF", "game_finished": true, "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is an almost unconditionally full cooperator. They consistently contribute their entire endowment to the public fund, with a single, minimal deviation very late in the game. Their contribution pattern is extremely stable and shows no meaningful conditionality on others’ behavior: they keep cooperating fully even when one group member persistently free-rides and even when some others start contributing less near the end. They treat full contribution as a default norm rather than a contingent strategy. There is no evidence that they track individual fairness in terms of “I’ll match your level”; instead, they appear committed to maximizing group efficiency and sustaining high public-good returns. Their small late-game deviation from full contribution is too slight and too isolated to clearly indicate strategic end-game defection; it may reflect mild horizon awareness, a minor experiment, or noise (interpretation: low confidence). Overall, they accept personal payoff sacrifice in favor of collective gain and show high risk tolerance that others might not reciprocate, yet they do not adjust their cooperative stance when that risk materializes.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThe player shows limited but noticeable horizon awareness. For most of the game, they behave as if cooperation is to be maintained regardless of time remaining. Near the end, they continue to fully cooperate even when others reduce their contributions, and they still spend on rewarding high contributors shortly before the final round. Only in the very last decision do they slightly reduce their own contribution instead of cleanly switching to defection. This suggests they recognize the approaching end but do not abandon their cooperative identity or shift into an aggressively self-interested mode. There is no systematic decay of contributions; instead, they preserve the cooperative norm and only marginally relax it at the final opportunity, implying that maintaining a cooperative pattern matters to them even when future reciprocation is no longer possible.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThe player is highly reluctant to punish and uses it sparingly and selectively. They employ punishment only once, and only against a clear, repeated free-rider whose contributions are dramatically below group norms, even when most others cooperate. This indicates a threshold-based norm-enforcement motive: they are willing to incur a personal cost to sanction pronounced, persistent non-cooperation but do not punish moderate deviations or late-game partial contributors. After that single act, they do not continue or escalate punishment, even though the target’s behavior gives further justification. This suggests that they may view punishment as a limited corrective signal rather than an ongoing deterrence strategy, or they may be uncomfortable sustaining costly sanctions. They never appear to use punishment retaliatorily; there is no sign they are responding to being targeted, since they themselves are never punished. Overall, they function as a very mild, last-resort enforcer against extreme free-riding, not as a systematic punisher.\n\n<REWARD>\nThe player is notably generous with rewards and uses them in a differentiated, contingent way. Early on, they are willing to spend substantial resources to reward nearly everyone who cooperates close to the maximum, signaling a strong preference for recognizing and reinforcing group-wide cooperation. Later, they target rewards more selectively toward individuals whose behavior is especially aligned with high contribution norms or who maintain strong cooperation while some others slacken. They do not mechanically reward in every round; instead, they cluster their rewarding in situations where cooperation is high or needs encouragement, and abstain in stable, high-cooperation periods where extra reinforcement seems less necessary. They never reward known free-riders when those free-riders have made very low contributions, and they do not “buy off” low contributors with positive incentives. This pattern points to a prosocial, norm-affirming strategy: they are willing to sacrifice their own payoff to acknowledge cooperative partners and to support a culture of high contribution, especially when it may influence behavior or express gratitude. Their use of reward is more frequent and heavier than their use of punishment, indicating a preference for positive reinforcement over negative sanctions.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThe player pays attention to both contributions and resulting payoffs but reacts mainly to observed contribution levels rather than to who is gaining or losing more money. They reward high contributors even when those players are already earning strong payoffs, indicating that perceived fairness for them is more about effort and norm adherence than about equalizing final earnings. Conversely, when a clear free-rider obtains higher payoffs due to low contributions and occasional received rewards from others, the player responds once with punishment, consistent with disapproval of profiteering from the public good without contributing. They do not systematically intervene when some players incur costs through their own reward or punishment decisions; they neither compensate such players nor retaliate against them. This suggests that they are not focused on meta-fairness about second-order actions, but remain centered on first-order contribution behavior. As others’ contributions fluctuate later in the game, the player remains cooperative and only occasionally rewards continued high contributors, showing that deviations by some do not trigger broad punitive or compensatory responses. Overall, their behavioral adjustments to others’ outcomes are modest: they signal approval to cooperators and, in one case, disapproval to a chronic defector, but they do not attempt to micromanage the payoff distribution or heavily shape others’ incentives through repeated intervention.", "umap_x": -0.02337903529405594, "umap_y": -0.8515587449073792, "cluster_id": 4, "cluster_size": 43, "cluster_title": "Punishment / Contribution / Reward", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around punishment, contribution, reward, cooperation, behavior."}

Their default is the maximum possible contribution. They maintain this even when one group member persistently contributes nothing and another sometimes contributes less than the maximum, suggesting that they prioritize group efficiency over strict payoff maximization and tolerate some degree of free‑riding.\n\nThey are conditionally cooperative in a mild, forgiving sense: occasional or moderate deviations by others do not lead them to reduce their own contribution. Only very late in the game, when several others reduce their contributions and the horizon is almost over, do they themselves step down from full contribution. This indicates both a concern for fairness and an awareness of diminishing returns to being the lone high contributor when end‑game incentives change.\n\nTheir behavior suggests relatively low risk aversion with respect to being exploited: they continue to fully cooperate even after being the only one maintaining full contributions in the presence of a clear, repeated defector. They appear motivated by efficiency and norm consistency more than by securing a strictly superior individual payoff each round.\n\nOverall, they fit a “principled, efficiency‑oriented conditional cooperator” type: they cooperate robustly, stay the course in the face of moderate exploitation, but adjust when the environment shifts and when cooperation from others becomes less reliable near the end.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThe player is clearly horizon‑aware: when the number of remaining rounds becomes very small and others begin to lower contributions, they finally reduce their own contribution as well. Up to that point, they maintain maximum cooperation despite noise and free‑riding, but the combination of impending termination and visible contribution declines appears to relax their commitment to full cooperation.\n\nThey do not escalate punishment or reward activity in the final round and instead remain passive in the social enforcement stage. This suggests they do not treat the end game as an opportunity for last‑minute retribution or reciprocal thanks. Instead, they adjust their direct contribution to align more closely with the emerging, slightly lower group norm and with the reduced future benefits of maintaining a strictly cooperative stance.\n\nOverall, end‑game behavior shows a modest decay in cooperation, but not a collapse: they still contribute a positive, substantial amount and do not switch to pure defection. This points to a type that recognizes the strategic logic of end games but is not purely driven by backward induction.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThe player is generally reluctant to use punishment and does so only once, in a targeted way, against a clear, persistent non‑contributor. This selectivity indicates that their threshold for punishing is high and likely tied to obvious, repeated violations of a cooperative norm rather than minor shortfalls or one‑off deviations.\n\nThey never punish low but still positive contributions, and they do not respond punitively to others’ punishment patterns, suggesting that retaliation is not a motive. They also do not engage in “anti‑social” punishment: they never target high contributors. When they finally do punish, it appears to be norm‑enforcing rather than spiteful, directed at a player whose behavior consistently diverges from the implicit group standard of high contribution.\n\nBecause they punish only once and in a context where the target’s behavior has already been stable for some time, their use of punishment seems more like an effort to send a costly signal about acceptable behavior than an ongoing deterrence strategy. After the punished individual later moves to full contribution, the focal player does not repeat punishment, which is consistent with a “corrective, not vengeful” type.\n\nOverall, this is a “reluctant norm enforcer”: willing to spend on punishment in principle, but only under clear, sustained free‑riding and not as a routine strategic tool.\n\n<REWARD>\nThe player never spends any resources on rewarding others, despite repeatedly observing very high and often unanimous cooperation. This indicates a strong asymmetry between their willingness to cooperate themselves and their willingness to incur direct costs to positively reinforce others.\n\nThe absence of reward usage persists even when others reward them or other high contributors, and when cooperation is very high and stable. This suggests that they do not see costly reward as necessary to sustain norms when contributions are already at or near full, or they may judge the reward technology as too inefficient to justify use. There is no evidence that they attempt to reciprocate received rewards with rewards of their own.\n\nTaken together, they behave as a “non‑rewarding cooperator”: they contribute generously but do not invest in costly positive reciprocity, either strategic (to build reputations) or expressive (to signal gratitude). Any gratitude or approval they might feel is not translated into reward behavior in this environment.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThe player closely observes others’ contributions and how payoffs are affected by punishment and reward, and they appear responsive to persistent patterns rather than to single outcomes.\n\nWhen one group member repeatedly contributes nothing yet continues to earn high payoffs, especially in comparison to fully cooperative players, the focal player eventually uses punishment against that individual. This indicates sensitivity to outcome‑based unfairness: consistently high earnings by a clear free‑rider relative to the cooperative majority seem to trigger their only act of costly sanctioning.\n\nThey do not react to others’ moderate under‑contributions or sporadic deviations with either punishment or reward, suggesting a tolerant attitude toward small inequities. They also do not mirror other players’ use of punishment or reward: they are not drawn into cycles of retaliation, nor do they imitate generous rewarders. Their contribution path remains stable even while some players spend substantial amounts rewarding or occasionally punishing others.\n\nThe player’s later decrease in contribution coincides with broader declines in some others’ contributions rather than with any clear change in the punishment/reward flows they see. This pattern suggests they learn primarily from contribution profiles and the general earnings environment, not from the specifics of others’ sanctioning behavior.\n\nIn personality terms, they come across as principled, somewhat stoic, and independent: they maintain high cooperation despite observing others’ opportunistic earnings and idiosyncratic punishment/reward choices, intervene only once to correct a clear free‑rider, and otherwise adjust their strategy gradually and modestly in response to the evolving group norm and the approaching end of the game.", "umap_x": 0.09967392683029175, "umap_y": -1.2965703010559082, "cluster_id": 2, "cluster_size": 40, "cluster_title": "Punishment / Group / Contribution", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around punishment, group, contribution, reward, contributions."}
{"experiment": "4Menw33JLbdtzSvug", "participant": "TaJQBuPufXkWZhmN4", "game_finished": true, "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a high-contribution cooperator with an early exploratory deviation. They strongly favor full contribution when they perceive the group as reliably cooperative and quickly return to that pattern after experimenting with free-riding. Their baseline appears to be contributing everything rather than splitting or contributing partially; they switch between extremes (all vs. nothing) rather than fine-tuning amounts, which suggests a simple, rule-based strategy instead of continuous adjustment.\n\nEarly on, they test zero contribution while others remain fully cooperative, and they continue this test briefly even after receiving costly punishment. This indicates some willingness to free-ride to see whether others will tolerate it, and an initial readiness to accept social sanction if the material payoff remains high. However, once they resume full contribution, they maintain it consistently for the remainder of the game, even as some others reduce contributions later. They do not appear to condition contributions tightly on minor deviations by others; as long as the overall environment looks mostly cooperative, they keep contributing fully.\n\nFairness concerns are ambiguous. Their initial free-riding alongside near-universal contribution from others shows low immediate concern for distributive fairness. Their later return to full contribution, despite continued opportunities to profit from free-riding, suggests either a shift toward norm compliance or a pragmatic desire to stabilize cooperation once they have seen that others are willing to enforce norms. Risk tolerance seems moderate: they are initially willing to risk being punished for free-riding, but once a stable cooperative pattern re-emerges, they stick to the safer, norm-aligned option rather than re-testing the boundaries.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThis player shows little evidence of end-game unraveling. After switching back to full contribution, they maintain high contributions through the final rounds, even as the horizon approaches and others begin to lower their contributions. They do not appear to exploit the final periods by cutting back, despite clear knowledge of the remaining number of rounds.\n\nThis pattern suggests either limited strategic anticipation of end-game dynamics, or a preference for stable cooperative behavior over last-moment opportunism. They may treat “cooperate once stable” as a default rule that they follow independent of the time horizon. Whether this reflects principled cooperation, inertia, or a belief that others may still punish in late rounds is unknown.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey never use punishment, despite having clear opportunities and a cost-effective punishment technology. They also experience punishment themselves after free-riding but do not reciprocate or counter-punish. This implies a strong reluctance to spend on negative sanctions, even when they are targeted.\n\nGiven that they resume cooperation after being punished, they appear responsive to punishment as a signal, but not motivated to participate in enforcing norms themselves. Their stance is consistent with a “non-enforcing” cooperator: willing to adapt to the enforcement behavior of others, but not to invest personal resources in deterrence or retaliation. Any emotional reaction to being punished (such as resentment or acceptance) is unknown; behaviorally, they do not act vindictively.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey never give rewards, even in periods of near-universal high cooperation when rewarding could be used to reinforce others. This holds both before and after they themselves receive rewards. They do not reciprocate reward, and they do not selectively reward high or especially generous contributors.\n\nThis pattern suggests they treat reward as an unnecessary cost rather than a strategic tool or expression of gratitude. Their cooperative behavior is not coupled with positive reciprocity via the reward channel; they prefer to express cooperation solely through their own contribution choice. Whether this is driven by narrow payoff maximization or by a simple “don’t touch sanction tools” rule is unknown, but the consistent inaction across very different group conditions points to a stable reluctance to spend on others’ payoffs.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey observe substantial variation in others’ sanctioning behavior—some players spend heavily on reward, others occasionally punish or mix reward and punishment. Despite this, they never adjust their use of sanctions and only adjust their own contributions in a coarse way (switching from free-riding back to full contribution once it becomes clear that others both cooperate and sometimes punish defectors).\n\nThey do not appear to mimic sanctioning styles or retaliate against those who may have punished them, consistent with the anonymity of sanctioners but also with a generally passive stance toward others’ payoff changes. They do not try to support or protect players who are net targets of punishment or who incur high reward costs. Their behavioral adaptation focuses solely on their own contribution level: when the environment signals that free-riding can draw costly punishment while cooperation is widespread and stable, they fall in line with that norm and stay there.\n\nOverall, this player type is a “sanction-averse conditional cooperator with coarse experimentation”: they initially test the gains from defection, respond to the combination of group cooperation and external punishment by reverting to full cooperation, and then maintain that cooperation without themselves engaging in any rewarding or punishing of others.", "umap_x": 0.08795348554849625, "umap_y": -0.6685289144515991, "cluster_id": 4, "cluster_size": 43, "cluster_title": "Punishment / Contribution / Reward", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around punishment, contribution, reward, cooperation, behavior."}

They reliably give the full endowment to the public fund for almost the entire game, despite clear evidence that at least one other participant persistently free-rides early on. They do not adjust their giving in response to moderate fluctuations in others’ contributions or to the presence of a known defector; they sustain maximal cooperation even when others’ average contributions fall. Only at the very end, when the game horizon is explicit and very close, do they reduce their contribution, and even then they still give a substantial amount rather than defecting fully. This pattern suggests that they treat full contribution as a normative baseline rather than a contingent, tit-for-tat response. They appear more motivated by maintaining a cooperative norm and maximizing group efficiency than by strict payoff optimization. Their tolerance for being exploited by a low contributor indicates high social preference for the public good and a low sensitivity to inequity when they are on the losing side, at least while the game is ongoing. They do, however, show some end-of-game self-interest, implying they are not purely altruistic but lean prosocial with bounded willingness to sacrifice.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThe player is clearly horizon-aware: their behavior shifts only when the game is about to end and the shadow of the future effectively disappears. Up to the penultimate phase they maintain the same cooperative pattern, even after observing repeated deviation by at least one peer. As the final round arrives, they reduce their contribution and keep a noticeable portion of their endowment. They do not escalate contributions for a “last show” of cooperation, nor do they collapse to zero; instead, they adopt a partial defection that improves their own payoff while still contributing nontrivially to the group. This indicates that they understand standard end-game logic and allow it to influence their choices, but they are constrained by an internal norm that prevents complete free-riding. Their cooperation decays slightly but not dramatically at the end, consistent with a prosocial type who accepts some final-round self-interest once future reciprocity is no longer possible, yet still prefers not to abandon the group outcome altogether.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThe player never uses punishment, despite repeated opportunities and a clear target in a consistently low-contributing peer. They also observe that others are willing to punish, including instances where low contributors receive deductions, but they do not join in or imitate this behavior. Their non-use persists even when punishment is relatively efficient in terms of impact per cost and when there is an identifiable mismatch between their own high contributions and others’ lower ones. This pattern suggests a strong aversion to harming others’ payoffs, even for norm-enforcement, or a belief that punishment is either unnecessary, ineffective, or outside their preferred role in the group. There is no evidence of retaliatory motives or of strategic use of punishment as a deterrent. They appear to adopt a “non-enforcer cooperator” stance: willing to be highly cooperative themselves but unwilling to spend resources to sanction defectors or shape others’ behavior through negative incentives.\n\n<REWARD>\nThe player also never uses positive reward, even though they observe several others repeatedly spending resources to reward high contributors. They see that generous rewarding is common and sometimes quite costly, yet they do not emulate this. This indicates that, although they value the public good enough to contribute heavily, they do not take on the more active “prosocial leader” or “moral entrepreneur” role who reinforces norms through side-payments. Possible interpretations (with low confidence on exact motive): they may view contributions as their primary and sufficient expression of cooperation; they may consider reward too costly or too weak relative to simple contribution; or they may be generally reluctant to manipulate others’ payoffs, whether positively or negatively. Their stance suggests a preference for direct cooperation over meta-strategies that attempt to manage others’ behavior through reward.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThe player remains behaviorally stable in the face of diverse patterns in others’ payoffs, punishment, and reward activity. They witness a persistent low contributor benefiting from the public good and intermittently being punished and rewarded by others, yet they do not change their own contribution strategy or begin using incentives themselves. They do not copy the “heavy rewarder” style exhibited by some peers, nor do they free-ride alongside the low contributor once its payoff advantage in some rounds becomes evident. When some players reduce contributions mid-to-late game or incur substantial costs on rewards, the focal player’s own choices stay largely unchanged, suggesting that they are relatively insensitive to distributional details of others’ payoffs and to observable sanctioning dynamics. Instead, they treat high contribution as their default behavior, largely independent of what others earn or spend. Their modest final-round deviation toward lower contribution appears tied more to the known end-game and less to any particular outcome of others. Overall, they seem calm, non-reactive, and resistant to norm-enforcing or norm-copying responses, embodying a “quiet, principled cooperator” who focuses on their own standard of behavior rather than finely tracking or correcting others.", "umap_x": 0.07191188633441925, "umap_y": -0.6554543375968933, "cluster_id": 4, "cluster_size": 43, "cluster_title": "Punishment / Contribution / Reward", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around punishment, contribution, reward, cooperation, behavior."}

They always give the entire endowment to the public fund, regardless of others’ behavior or the stage of the game.

This pattern suggests a strong internal norm favoring full cooperation or an understanding that contributing is individually profitable given the multiplier, and they adhere to this consistently without experimentation. They show no evidence of risk aversion about being exploited, and they do not attempt to fine-tune contributions to match or sanction others’ lower levels. Their notion of fairness seems oriented toward “I do my part fully,” without actively enforcing proportionality on others via contribution adjustments.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThey exhibit no end-game decline in cooperation. Even as the horizon shortens and others start reducing their contributions, they maintain full giving to the public good. This indicates clear horizon awareness (the remaining-rounds information is present) but no opportunistic shift: they do not try to exploit the final rounds, nor do they “give up” on cooperation when others become less cooperative near the end. Their strategy is time-invariant, suggesting either a principle-based or rule-based approach to cooperation that does not depend on future interaction value.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey never use punishment, despite repeated exposure to clear deviations from full cooperation by some group members and multiple examples of others deploying punishment against low contributors. Their baseline is strong cooperation without any enforcement behavior. This suggests either a preference against inflicting harm, even on free riders, or a belief that punishment is not worthwhile or not their role. There is no sign of targeted or selective punishment; the strategy is simply to abstain. They also do not respond with punishment to any outcome where others’ actions indirectly reduce their own payoffs, so retaliatory motives are not observable. Overall, they fit a “non-punishing cooperator” profile.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey do not use reward at any point, even though most others frequently contribute highly and sometimes reward peers. They receive rewards in several periods but never reciprocate in kind, at least not via the formal reward mechanism. This suggests that gratitude, if present, does not translate into costly positive reciprocity, or that they prioritize keeping their payoff over investing in others’ incentives once their own cooperative behavior is set. They appear to rely on their contributions alone as their prosocial act, and they treat the reward technology as unnecessary or inefficient. There is no observable strategic use of reward to encourage high contributors or rehabilitate low ones.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey are behaviorally inert to others’ payoffs, punishments, and rewards. Observing others spend on punishment and reward, as well as shifts in who earns more or less, does not lead them to modify their own contribution or enforcement choices. They neither join emerging norms of sanctioning low contributors nor reciprocate those who reward them, and they do not mirror others who withhold contributions. This suggests they follow a pre-committed rule—always fully cooperate, ignore secondary mechanisms—rather than dynamically adapting to outcome patterns. Their stance toward outcome inequality is unclear: they do not act to narrow it via punishment of high free riders or reward of high contributors, but they also do not exploit it.

They contribute the entire endowment in every round, without exception, regardless of what others do. Their behavior indicates a strong internal norm for full cooperation that does not waver in response to minor free-riding or noisy deviations by others. They appear insensitive to short-term personal payoff maximization within the contribution stage and instead prioritize maximizing the group return, even when some others give less. There is no sign of conditional cooperation or tit-for-tat; they do not reduce their contribution when others contribute less, and they do not escalate beyond full contribution when others increase theirs. Their risk tolerance for being exploited is high: they continue to cooperate fully even when a consistent low contributor is present and when end-game incentives could justify self-serving deviation. This suggests a principled or rule-based cooperator type rather than an outcome-contingent strategist.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThe player shows no observable end-game defection. Their contributions stay at the maximum until the very last round, despite the clear information about the finite horizon and observable decreases in some others’ contributions near the end. They do not appear to adjust their strategy in anticipation of the game concluding; neither a decay in cooperation nor a last-round grab for personal payoff is evident. There is also no compensatory use of punishment or reward at the end to “correct” late-stage free-riding. Overall, their pattern fits an agent who follows a stable cooperation rule independent of horizon length, with no visible end-game opportunism or strategic winding down.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThis player never uses punishment, even when at least one group member persistently contributes far less than the others and is also sometimes rewarded by others or only lightly punished. They also refrain from punishing moderate under-contributors in later rounds. Given that no punishment is used at any point, they either (a) discount the value of punishment as a tool for improving future cooperation, (b) dislike the idea of harming others’ payoffs, or (c) adhere to a “no harm” or strictly non-punitive norm. There is no evidence of retaliatory impulses; they are never punished themselves and thus never face a direct provocation. Their inaction in the face of ongoing free-riding implies either strong aversion to norm-enforcement via sanctions, a focus on their own cooperative principle rather than policing others, or a belief that punishment is unnecessary or inefficient. The data do not reveal which motive dominates, so specific underlying reasoning remains unknown.\n\n<REWARD>\nThe player never uses rewards, despite being consistently high-contributing in groups that are often near full contribution. They do receive positive rewards from others in some rounds but do not reciprocate, neither toward those who reward them nor toward high contributors more generally. This absence of rewarding might indicate that they prioritize conserving their own payoff over spending extra to recognize others, even though they do not take the analogous self-protection step in the contribution stage. Alternatively, they may not view reward as necessary when cooperation levels are already high, or they may simply adhere to a minimalist strategy in the sanction/reward stage (“do nothing”) while being maximally generous in the contribution stage. There is no sign of strategic rewarding to shape others’ behavior, no reciprocity-based gifts, and no targeted positive reinforcement for under- or over-performers.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThe player’s behavior is strikingly inertial with respect to others’ outcomes. They observe that a particular peer free-rides repeatedly and is sometimes lightly punished or rewarded by others, but they never alter their own contributions or sanctioning behavior in response. Likewise, when other participants spend substantial amounts rewarding or punishing, this player does not adopt similar tactics, imitate, or counteract them. Even visible patterns—such as some players repeatedly spending heavily on rewards or others selectively punishing low contributors—do not appear to influence their choices. They are also sometimes rewarded themselves, but show no behavioral change following this: no increased use of rewards toward others, no shift toward sanctioning chronic free-riders, and no withdrawal of cooperation.

{"experiment": "4Menw33JLbdtzSvug", "participant": "qzp8RyXNHPzFLMT55", "game_finished": true, "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a generally high contributor who occasionally shades down contributions in a controlled, non-drifting way. They usually match or nearly match the full endowment and only reduce their own contribution by a moderate amount rather than defecting outright. Their giving is not purely unconditional: when others fully cooperate, they remain highly cooperative, but they sometimes allow themselves a modest personal gain even in a high-cooperation environment, suggesting a blend of cooperative preference and self-interest. There is no evidence of strong concern for strict equality of contributions, as they continue to cooperate fully alongside a persistent zero-contributor without visible retaliation. They show no obvious risk-avoidance or fear of being exploited; instead, they appear comfortable maintaining high contributions even when one player repeatedly free rides. Overall, they fit a “pro-social but not self-sacrificing to the limit” profile: they want the group to succeed and are willing to carry their share, but they allow some small opportunistic deviations rather than strictly enforcing a moral norm on themselves.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nAs the game approaches its conclusion, their contribution level declines modestly, not sharply. They do not “unravel” to zero; instead, they cut their own giving while most others remain cooperative. This pattern indicates clear horizon awareness: they recognize the diminishing future value of maintaining full cooperation and start to secure slightly higher private payoffs. However, they still remain contributors rather than defectors, suggesting that their cooperative disposition partially constrains pure end-game profit-taking. Simultaneously, they ramp up their use of rewards right at the very end, directing resources toward others despite the absence of future rounds in which such incentives could change behavior. That last-moment generosity points to a motivation beyond strict forward-looking strategy—possibly a preference for expressing approval or “thanking” perceived cooperators—coexisting with a mild end-game self-favoring cut in contributions.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey never employ punishment, even when a clear low contributor benefits repeatedly, and even though punishment is relatively efficient in terms of impact per unit cost. This lack of use persists across different contribution environments and phases of the game. There is no sign of retaliatory punishment in response to being punished themselves; when they are targeted once, they do not answer with punishment. This suggests either a general aversion to punitive actions, a belief that punishment is not worth the cost, or a preference to avoid antagonistic or norm-enforcing roles. Given that others do punish in the environment, their continued abstention suggests a stable type rather than mere inattention. Their approach is best characterized as non-punitive and non-retaliatory, with low emphasis on negative reciprocity or deterrence through sanctions.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey are willing to spend nontrivial amounts on rewards, and they do so in a targeted and context-sensitive manner. Early on, they reward high contributors, which is consistent with a desire to reinforce cooperative behavior or signal approval. They also, at one point, reward the persistent low contributor in a context where that player continues to give almost nothing; alongside the fact that this player is simultaneously being punished heavily by others, this suggests that the focal player sometimes uses rewards in a counter-normative or compensatory way, possibly to offset what they view as excessive punishment or to encourage inclusion rather than exclusion. Later, they shift to rewarding a returning or lower contributor when that player reappears and gives modestly, which fits a pattern of “welcome back” or encouragement for participation. In the very final stage, they allocate substantial reward to multiple peers, including mid and high contributors, without any instrumental future benefit. This end-game generosity appears driven by intrinsic social preferences (e.g., expressing gratitude, approval, or fairness concerns) rather than strategic long-term incentives. Overall, their reward behavior is selective, prosocial, and sometimes compassionate toward disadvantaged or targeted players.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey clearly attend to others’ outcomes: they respond to who is contributing, who is being punished, and who is being rewarded. They never exploit observing others’ punishment costs to attack or pile on; instead, they occasionally act in the opposite direction, rewarding someone who is both contributing little and being punished by others. This pattern suggests empathy or discomfort with seeing someone heavily sanctioned, even if that person’s behavior is suboptimal for the group. When others exit and re-enter or show weaker participation, the player responds with encouragement via rewards rather than with punishment or reduced contributions targeted at those individuals. When they themselves incur punishment, they do not retaliate and do not substantially adjust their cooperative stance, implying a relatively low sensitivity to mild negative shocks from anonymous peers.

They usually choose the cooperative option, contributing their full endowment when they perceive that others are generally doing the same. Their deviation into not contributing appears reactive to perceived low or inconsistent average contributions by others rather than a fixed selfish preference. After that trial of free-riding, they revert to full contributions and maintain that pattern until the end, even when some others keep contributing nothing. They seem to hold a norm that everyone should contribute fully, and they implicitly treat non-contributors as norm violators rather than as rational payoff maximizers. Their risk tolerance appears moderate: they stick with contributing even though some others are not, apparently trusting that enough players will continue to cooperate to make contributions worthwhile, but they are willing to test non-contribution once when frustrated. They pay attention to who is persistently not contributing and track this across rounds.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nTheir tone is norm-enforcing but not hostile, using light humor or softening signals (such as friendly punctuation) when calling out non-contributors. They actively engage in chat, referencing specific players who are not cooperating and aligning with others who want high contributions. They attempt mild social pressure and coordination: they publicly signal that non-contributors are visible and later explicitly name specific low contributors, reinforcing the idea that the group can monitor and sanction them. They echo and reinforce others’ informational messages, which suggests they see communication as a tool to build shared awareness and to justify punishment. They respond to others’ comments rather than monologuing, indicating a cooperative, interactive communication style oriented toward group-level coordination on norms and sanctions.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThey do not significantly reduce their contribution level as the game approaches the final rounds; they continue to choose the cooperative contribution option even in the last round. However, their use of punishment becomes more targeted at the very end, extending sanctions to a persistent non-contributor who had been free-riding across many rounds. This suggests some awareness that consequences can be imposed even when there is no future to shape behavior, implying a mixture of norm-enforcement and perhaps expressive or retributive motives rather than purely forward-looking deterrence. There is no clear evidence that they change their cooperative strategy purely because the game is ending; instead, end-game effects appear primarily in the choice of whom to punish, not whether to contribute.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey are a selective, low-intensity punisher focused on clear non-contributors. They are willing to spend on punishment multiple times but only in small units and only against players who repeatedly give nothing or near-nothing. Their choices are consistent with second-order cooperation: they aim to enforce a contribution norm and support group welfare by making free-riding costly. They also coordinate their sanctions with chat-based labeling of defectors, publicly highlighting targets before or while punishing. Their punishment is not retaliatory in the narrow sense (there is no direct evidence they are responding to being personally punished) but rather directed at those violating the contribution norm. They do not appear to punish conditional cooperators or those who merely reduce contributions somewhat; they focus on persistent zero contributors. They never use punishment against high contributors, which suggests a clear fairness norm and avoidance of antisocial punishment. Their final-round punishment of a chronic non-contributor, despite no future rounds, indicates that disapproval and norm expression themselves are valued, even without future incentive effects.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey never use the reward option despite frequent high contributions from many others. This suggests that they either undervalue positive reinforcement compared to punishment or view it as unnecessary given that cooperation is already relatively high. It is also possible they see rewarding as less efficient or less justified than punishing clear violations, or they may simply prioritize conserving their own payoff over paying for rewards. There is no evidence of gratitude signaling through costly rewards; their norm-enforcement style is one-sided (punish defectors) rather than symmetric (reward cooperators and punish defectors).\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey monitor others’ behavior in detail, particularly who contributes nothing and how often. Their chat explicitly references specific players’ ongoing non-contribution and aligns with others calling for punishment, showing that they integrate observed outcomes into both talk and action. They seem indifferent to how much others spend on punishment itself and do not comment on extreme punishers; their attention stays on who is being free-ridden on and who is free-riding. They show no explicit emotional reaction to large negative payoffs suffered by punished free-riders, nor do they express sympathy for heavily sanctioned players. Conversely, they also do not praise or comment on high contributors’ payoffs.

Contributions remain maximal through to the very last round, with no reduction when the horizon is near and no strategic shift in punishment or reward behavior at the end. They neither exploit the last rounds for personal gain nor relax their cooperative standard when mutual future enforcement is less relevant. This pattern suggests that their cooperation is principle-driven rather than purely strategic with respect to the game’s finite horizon. Their use of punishment does not intensify or taper specifically around the final rounds; instead, they return to not using punishment at the very end, consistent with their generally sparse use of sanctions.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey are generally reluctant to punish, but they do employ targeted, low-intensity punishment against persistent non-contributors who are publicly discussed in chat as problematic. When group members highlight specific free-riders, they join the sanctioning effort with a single-unit punishment directed at those targets. They do not engage in indiscriminate or high-cost sanctioning and refrain from punishing most of the time, even when there are multiple low contributors. This suggests they view punishment as a corrective group tool to enforce cooperation norms rather than as a channel for retaliation or venting. Their participation appears contingent on clear evidence and social consensus about who is free-riding. They never punish cooperators, and there is no sign of antisocial punishment. Overall, they are a selective, moderate co-punisher who prefers norms to be enforced but avoids large personal expenditure on sanctions.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey never use the reward option despite being a consistent high contributor and observing other players who also contribute fully and sometimes spend heavily to punish. This indicates a preference to conserve resources rather than spend extra to positively reinforce cooperative behavior, even when such reinforcement could be justified by gratitude or strategic signaling. It could also reflect uncertainty about the value of rewards, low salience of rewarding compared to punishing free-riders, or a belief that cooperation is simply expected and not something to be especially rewarded. Their social enforcement thus leans asymmetrically toward punishment of defectors rather than reward of contributors.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey pay attention to others’ contributions and apparently track who repeatedly contributes nothing versus who cooperates. Their chat comments show awareness that more people are starting to contribute and that some players’ behavior is inconsistent with their cooperative rhetoric. They join group-led punishment campaigns only against those widely seen as chronic non-contributors, implying they integrate both outcome information and group signals before acting. There is no expressed sympathy or gloating about heavy punishments; their brief remarks focus on behavior (“start giving,” “coin need to be on the upper part”) rather than on payoff swings or suffering. They do not adjust their own cooperative strategy based on others’ payoffs, even when free-riders gain relative advantages or when defectors are severely punished. This suggests that others’ outcomes inform their occasional punishment decisions but do not drive their own contribution level, which remains principled and stable.", "umap_x": -0.2748725116252899, "umap_y": -0.7144058346748352, "cluster_id": 4, "cluster_size": 43, "cluster_title": "Punishment / Contribution / Reward", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around punishment, contribution, reward, cooperation, behavior."}

They always contribute the full endowment when given a binary choice between nothing and everything, and they maintain this pattern across varying group contribution levels, including when many others free‑ride and their own payoff is relatively low. Their behavior suggests a strong internal norm for full cooperation that does not depend on others’ current actions or on short‑term payoff optimization. They show no evidence of conditional cooperation (they do not scale their contributions up or down in response to others), nor of strategic end‑game defection; they continue to fully cooperate through the final round despite knowing the horizon. Risk tolerance appears relatively high with respect to exploitation: they accept repeated exposure to free‑riding others rather than adjust downward. Their fairness norm seems to be “do the socially efficient thing yourself” rather than “match others” or “punish deviations by contributing less.”\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThey are entirely silent in the chat. They do not participate in coordination efforts, do not defend themselves when mischaracterized, and do not comment on punishment campaigns or others’ behavior. This suggests an avoidant or low‑engagement communication style: they cooperate via actions but do not attempt to persuade, signal, or negotiate socially. They also do not correct others’ mistaken claims about their contributions, indicating either indifference to reputation in this setting, reluctance to engage in conflict, or a preference to conserve effort and attention. Their cooperative behavior is thus “quiet” and non‑verbal, with no visible attempts at leadership or norm‑setting through messages.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThey show no end‑game unraveling: contributions remain maximal all the way to the last round, even after substantial punishment activity emerges, and even when others intermittently free‑ride. There is no sign they try to exploit the final period or adjust strategy due to the approaching horizon. This pattern is consistent with a rule‑based or norm‑driven approach (“always contribute fully”) rather than a backward‑induction logic focused on final‑round payoff maximization. If they are aware of the round structure (which is displayed), they do not visibly incorporate it into their decisions; they treat early and late rounds similarly in terms of cooperation and inaction in the sanctioning stage.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey never use the punishment option, despite repeated and salient opportunities and despite others openly calling for punishment of specific low contributors and then heavily using sanctions. This refusal is stable across conditions with both high and low cooperation in the group. The player appears strongly reluctant to spend on harming others, even when clear free‑riding targets exist and when a coordinated punishment campaign is underway. Their behavior could reflect a cost‑minimizing stance toward the sanctioning stage (preserving own payoff), a moral aversion to harming others (even defectors), or belief that punishment is unnecessary or inefficient; which of these is primary is unknown. They also do not engage in counter‑punishment or retaliation; they themselves are not targeted, and they do not punish on behalf of fairness concerns either. Overall, they are a non‑punishing cooperator who leaves norm enforcement entirely to others.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey also never use the reward option, even when many others contribute fully and some players clearly bear high costs to enforce cooperation. This suggests they do not invest in positive sanctions or explicit reciprocity via the reward mechanism. The pattern indicates a narrow focus on their own direct contribution as their chosen cooperative act, with no additional expenditure to shape others’ behavior through incentives. Whether this stems from a payoff‑preserving motive (avoiding the extra cost), from indifference to formal reward tools, or from an assumption that rewards are unnecessary because cooperation is already high is uncertain. They do not appear to use rewards strategically (e.g., to encourage wavering contributors) or express gratitude monetarily.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey observe others’ outcomes (including extreme punishment costs and large negative payoffs) but do not adjust their own sanctioning or contribution behavior in response. They neither join the heavy‑punishment norm nor try to offset it; they do not, for instance, reward heavily punished cooperators or punish extreme punishers. They remain behaviorally detached: fully cooperative in contributions but inactive in the sanctioning stage throughout. This indicates low responsiveness to observed payoff distributions and to others’ sanctioning efforts. They do not visibly react to cases where non‑contributors are harshly sanctioned, nor to situations where some players sink their own payoffs through repeated punishment. Their stance is that of a stable, aloof cooperator whose actions are largely invariant to the evolving pattern of others’ gains, losses, and enforcement behavior.", "umap_x": 0.1522531658411026, "umap_y": -0.4684217870235443, "cluster_id": 4, "cluster_size": 43, "cluster_title": "Punishment / Contribution / Reward", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around punishment, contribution, reward, cooperation, behavior."}
{"experiment": "4Z5uDYPcFsmMAnBJf", "participant": "9Yg6AsY5zPPfompXq", "game_finished": true, "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a high, mostly stable contributor who occasionally free-rides when they expect others to maintain high cooperation. They usually give the full endowment rather than splitting or withholding, indicating a preference for group efficiency over immediate personal gain when they believe others are also contributing. The lone zero contribution early in the game looks like an exploratory or opportunistic deviation rather than a shift to permanent defection; they quickly return to full giving and maintain it thereafter. Their contributions do not appear strongly contingent on punishment burdens or on detailed tracking of who contributed what; instead they act as if the default norm is “everyone should max-contribute,” and they uphold it even when some others clearly do not. Risk tolerance is moderate: they are willing to keep contributing fully despite visible defectors, but they occasionally experiment with non-contribution, suggesting they balance social preferences with some payoff consciousness. Fairness norms are contribution-based: they implicitly treat zero contributors as norm violators, but they keep contributing themselves instead of matching low levels, suggesting they value maintaining a high public good more than strict reciprocity.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThey communicate infrequently but with a clear, norm-enforcing tone. When they do speak, they point out specific non-contributors and align themselves with those calling for accountability. Their style is concise, slightly dry, and oriented toward coordination rather than social bonding or banter. They echo and reinforce others’ informational messages about who is not contributing, indicating attentiveness to the group’s discussion and a desire to support a shared understanding of free-riding. They do not attempt to soothe, joke, or de-escalate; instead they lean into the “call out and then punish” atmosphere. Engagement is selective: they remain mostly silent except when identifying defectors, suggesting a task-focused, instrumental use of chat rather than a socially expressive one.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nAwareness of the finite horizon does not lead them to defect in contributions; they continue to give fully up through the final round. However, end-game conditions amplify their willingness to punish: near the end, they impose costly sanctions even when these can no longer change future behavior, indicating that they accept or even endorse “expressive” or retributive punishment rather than purely strategic deterrence. They do not show visible attempts to exploit the last rounds by reducing contributions once cooperation is high; instead they keep behaving as a high contributor while continuing or intensifying punishment of chronic free-riders. This pattern suggests that, in their type, end-game behavior shifts more in the punishment domain than in the contribution domain: they do not give up on the public good but do become more willing to pay to make defectors worse off regardless of future payoffs.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey are an actively punitive, norm-enforcing type who repeatedly spends sizeable amounts to punish low contributors and suspected bots or free-riders. They target those who repeatedly contribute nothing or very little, focusing primarily on a few persistent low contributors; this shows selectivity tied to observed behavior rather than indiscriminate aggression. Their threshold for punishing appears relatively low: once a player is categorized as a free-rider in their mind, they are willing to punish them multiple times across rounds, including in periods when overall contribution levels are still high. They never punish high contributors or obvious cooperators, suggesting that their punishment rule is behavior-based and not spiteful toward random others. The fact that they punish in early rounds, continue to do so in middle rounds, and escalate or maintain punishment even in the final round indicates that they are not purely payoff-maximizing; they accept substantial personal cost to enforce a fairness norm and may gain psychological or moral satisfaction from sanctioning defectors. They sometimes join in group-coordinated punishment (e.g., aligning with calls to “get” a particular non-contributor), showing responsiveness to collective targeting. Low-confidence but plausible: they may conflate some players’ earlier non-contribution or confusing interface behavior with deliberate defection, as they punish some avatars that later contribute, which suggests limited updating or a tendency to fix labels once assigned.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey never use the reward option despite frequent opportunities and the same cost-effectiveness as punishment. This asymmetry implies that they prioritize negative reciprocity and norm enforcement over positive reinforcement. They do not appear motivated to build alliances via rewards or to explicitly thank high contributors with material benefits; instead they rely on continued own contributions as their cooperative signal and use sanctions to shape others’ behavior. From a type perspective, they behave like a “punitive cooperator” rather than a “rewarding cooperator.” Their unwillingness to reward is consistent across the entire game and does not relax even when others clearly contribute maximally, indicating that for them, meeting the contribution norm is expected baseline behavior, not something to be materially rewarded.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey pay attention to others’ contribution histories and to public discussion about who is giving or not, and they adapt their punishment choices accordingly, but they show little interest in the detailed payoff consequences for each player beyond identifying sanction targets. They do not comment on the extreme negative payoffs some players incur from heavy punishment; there is no evidence of sympathy or concern about over-punishment in their communications. Instead, their behavior is consistent with acceptance of very severe sanctions on chronic defectors. They do not appear to respond with “revenge punishment” to being punished themselves; when they are punished once, there is no clear shift toward retaliating against likely punishers, suggesting they either do not infer identities or do not care to retaliate. They coordinate implicitly with others’ punishment patterns: when the group converges on targeting specific low contributors, they join or reinforce that pattern, accepting cumulative punishment outcomes as appropriate rather than excessive. Overall, they interpret others’ outcomes mostly through a fairness lens—high payoffs for cooperators are unremarkable, while preserving or improving fairness via punishing defectors is worth their own payoff loss.", "umap_x": -0.8745778203010559, "umap_y": -1.0878159999847412, "cluster_id": 2, "cluster_size": 40, "cluster_title": "Punishment / Group / Contribution", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around punishment, group, contribution, reward, contributions."}

They always give the maximum possible amount to the public fund and never deviate, even when others free‑ride, when overall contributions drop, or when the game approaches its final rounds. Their behavior suggests a strong efficiency norm (maximizing group returns given a high multiplier) that dominates short‑term self-interest. They appear risk-tolerant with respect to being exploited: they persist in full cooperation despite persistent zero contributors and heavy noise in punishment behavior around them. There is no clear evidence of conditional cooperation; they do not reduce contributions in response to low contributions or erratic group behavior. Fairness preferences appear to be focused on “everyone should contribute fully,” but they themselves do not condition their own giving on others’ adherence.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThe player never speaks in chat. They do not join coordination attempts, do not publicly pressure free‑riders, and do not respond to others’ comments about contributors or punishment targets. Their style is entirely action-based rather than verbal. This suggests a low-communication, low-visibility approach: they rely on contribution and punishment choices to express norms rather than persuasion or social bonding. They are engaged in the game strategically (given their consistent behavior) but socially reserved or indifferent to the chat channel.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThey show no end‑game decay in cooperation. They continue to contribute the maximum amount until the final round and maintain the same general pattern of selective punishment. They do not appear to shift toward short-term payoff maximization as the remaining rounds shrink, nor do they dramatically ramp up punishment or reward in anticipation of the game ending. Horizon awareness is unknown from their own words, but their unchanged behavior across the game suggests either indifference to the horizon or a principle-driven strategy that is not adjusted by the finite length.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey use punishment sparingly and in a highly targeted way. When they do punish, they focus on clear, repeated free‑riders and stay away from contributors. They never engage in broad or indiscriminate sanctioning and do not appear to use punishment to retaliate personally (they are not visibly targeted by others, and there is no sign of revenge behavior). Their punishment volume is modest relative to what others around them are sometimes spending; they pay small, occasional costs rather than participating in extreme sanctioning cascades.\n\nThey sometimes punish a known free‑rider repeatedly across separated opportunities, which suggests a deterrence or norm-enforcement motive (“noncontributors should be sanctioned”) rather than random or impulsive use. They do not follow all group punishment calls; at least once, others explicitly urge everyone to hit a particular target, but the player abstains at that moment despite prior and later willingness to punish the same target. This indicates independent judgment: they share the norm against free‑riding but are selective about when to enforce it and do not blindly follow mob cues.\n\nOverall, they are a mild altruistic punisher: willing to incur some cost to discipline obvious defectors, but unwilling to sink large amounts of payoff into punishment or to spread punishment beyond the most salient free‑riders.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey never reward anyone, despite recurrent high contributions by many players and occasional prosocial or coordinating chat messages by others. The reward technology is symmetric to punishment in cost-effectiveness, yet they consistently ignore it. This suggests that their norm-enforcement style is one-sided: they see negative sanctions against defectors as appropriate but do not see positive sanctions for cooperators as necessary or worthwhile. They do not use reward as a tool for strategic reinforcement or to signal gratitude.\n\nThis pattern is consistent with a player who views full contribution as the baseline expected behavior that does not merit extra payment, while free‑riding is a violation that sometimes merits punishment. Whether they conceptually value reward but see it as inefficient, or simply don’t think in terms of positive incentives, is unknown.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThe player is consistently exposed to detailed information about others’ payoffs, as well as the magnitudes of punishment and reward costs and deductions, but they react only in limited, structured ways. They do not appear to copy the extreme behaviors of heavy punishers, nor do they escalate their own punishment spending in response to others’ sanctioning or the persistence of free‑riding. Instead, they keep their own sanctioning at a low, controlled level.\n\nThey refrain from punishing contributors, even when others are punished in ways that look noisy or excessive. This suggests that they pay attention to the combination of contributions and punishments and maintain a clear internal rule: defectors can be sanctioned; cooperators should not be. They also appear unintimidated by others’ heavy use of punishment—there is no discernible shift in either their contributions or their own sanctioning pattern in response to seeing very large punishment expenditures or large negative payoffs for some players.\n\nThey do not visibly respond to others’ being punished or rewarded with any changes in communication (they never speak) or in contribution behavior (they always fully contribute). Their main adaptation in response to observed outcomes is the selective choice of punishment targets across a few rounds; otherwise, they stay on a fixed cooperative trajectory.", "umap_x": -0.1556541621685028, "umap_y": -0.8735702037811279, "cluster_id": 4, "cluster_size": 43, "cluster_title": "Punishment / Contribution / Reward", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around punishment, contribution, reward, cooperation, behavior."}

They repeatedly choose to place their full endowment into the public fund in most rounds and do so even when some others are clearly free-riding. Their single zero-contribution appears opportunistic rather than a full strategic shift: after trying defection once, they immediately revert to full contributions and then maintain that pattern through the rest of the game, including in late rounds. This suggests a baseline cooperative preference that tolerates some inequality in returns. They do not systematically condition their contributions on the presence of non-contributors; instead, they continue to cooperate despite visible under-contribution by specific others. They appear relatively risk-tolerant in continuing to invest fully in the public fund even when average contributions fall and free-riders are evident. Their behavior indicates a weak or absent equity norm in terms of matching: they do not insist on strict fairness where contributors and non-contributors earn similarly adjusted payoffs; instead, they accept that others may gain more privately while still choosing the cooperative option.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThey do not send any chat messages throughout the game. They observe an active discussion about contribution coordination, free-riders, and punishment targets but remain silent. This indicates a low-communication, non-leadership style: they neither guide others, clarify mechanics, nor join in the social norm-enforcement rhetoric. The silence is consistent and not contingent on particular events, suggesting either a preference for focusing on decisions rather than conversation, discomfort or disinterest in social interaction, or simple inattention to the chat channel. They also do not verbally protest unfairness or endorse collective punishment campaigns, even when clear deviants are identified. Their engagement style is therefore observational and passive in communication, allowing others to set norms and agendas without overt support or resistance.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nAwareness of the finite horizon is possible given the interface, but no direct evidence appears in their behavior beyond stable contributions. They maintain full contributions into the final rounds, including the very last one, and do not show the typical end-game decline in cooperation. There is no last-minute exploitation or deviation from their established pattern of high giving after the early defection. They also do not leverage punishment or reward more aggressively near the end when future retaliation is impossible. This stability suggests either that they de-emphasize horizon effects in their reasoning, or that they adopt a simple, fixed cooperative rule and follow it through to completion. Their behavior is consistent with a “cooperate to the end” type rather than a strategically backward-inducting defector, at least in this environment.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey never spend any coins on punishment, despite many opportunities and strong social cues encouraging it. They see clear cases of players contributing nothing for multiple rounds, and they see others spending large amounts to punish these low contributors, often coordinated via explicit chat calls to “get” specific targets. Nonetheless, they consistently abstain from punishing. This pattern suggests either an aversion to costly punishment in general or a prioritization of personal payoff and/or group surplus over sanctioning. Because they also do not retaliate or defend others via punishment, the behavior points more toward a non-enforcer type than a strategic free-rider on enforcement. They appear content to let others bear the cost of norm enforcement while they focus on contribution and earnings. There is no evidence of conditional punishment (e.g., sanctioning after their own rare defection is punished), since they themselves are not targeted. Their motives for abstaining are unknown, but their revealed type is a non-punishing cooperator, even when social pressure to punish is high.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey also never use the reward option, even though they are surrounded by many consistent high contributors and occasionally receive reward themselves. They do not reciprocate that positive treatment, nor do they strategically reward to reinforce cooperation or coordinate a high-contribution equilibrium. The choice not to reward remains constant across early and late rounds. Given that they benefit from others’ high contributions, their refusal to reward is consistent with a general preference to avoid any costly sanctioning action, whether positive or negative. They appear to treat reward similarly to punishment: as a non-essential, payoff-reducing tool they decline to use. There is no evidence that they differentiate between rewarding particularly cooperative players and ignoring them; instead, they simply never incur these costs. This makes them a “non-rewarding cooperator,” relying purely on their own contributions rather than explicit incentives to shape others’ behavior.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey can see detailed end-of-round information, including who is being heavily punished, who is overspending on sanctions, and the resulting extreme negative payoffs for some players. Despite this, they neither adjust their own contribution strategy in response to these outcomes nor step into the punishment/reward system. Their contributions remain high even as some free-riders gain and as some players incur substantial costs by enforcing norms. They do not appear to respond behaviorally to the observed suffering of targets (e.g., players driven into large negative payoffs) or to the inefficiency introduced by massive punishment expenditures. They also do not compensate cooperative heavy-punishers with rewards, even when it is clear they are sacrificing their own payoffs to discipline defectors. Overall, they treat others’ payoffs and sanctioning choices as background information rather than inputs into their own actions. The lack of visible emotional or strategic reaction to these outcomes is consistent with a detached, individually focused cooperator, concerned primarily with their own contribution choice and immediate payoff, and not with rebalancing or reciprocating based on what happens to others.", "umap_x": -0.0970519632101059, "umap_y": -0.4003717005252838, "cluster_id": 4, "cluster_size": 43, "cluster_title": "Punishment / Contribution / Reward", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around punishment, contribution, reward, cooperation, behavior."}
{"experiment": "4Z5uDYPcFsmMAnBJf", "participant": "QDWtgTdWgBPwpn897", "game_finished": true, "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a high, almost unconditional cooperator who treats full contribution as the default. They consistently give their entire endowment to the public fund in nearly all rounds, including late in the game when others have defected previously. Deviation from this pattern occurs only once and not in a gradual way; they switch abruptly from full contribution to zero and then immediately return to full contribution afterward. That single defection does not appear to be carefully calibrated to others’ behavior and may reflect experimentation, momentary opportunism, or error; their overall pattern still strongly favors cooperation.\n\nTheir cooperation does not seem tightly conditional on recent group averages; they continue to invest fully even after repeated free-riding by specific players and after observing substantial payoff losses from their own punishments. This suggests they prioritize the efficiency and norm value of full contribution over short-run self-interest. They show no visible effort to match others’ contributions or to “punish by withholding cooperation”; instead, they leave norm enforcement to the punishment mechanism.\n\nRisk tolerance looks moderate to high: they are willing to incur large personal costs via punishment while continuing to contribute fully, absorbing both opportunity cost (of not defecting) and direct monetary costs. There is no sign that they chase individual payoff maximization; fairness and norm compliance appear more central than risk-adjusted earnings.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nTheir communication is sparse, reactive, and emotionally light. They speak only a few times, mostly in short, informal messages. Early on, they acknowledge the group’s coordination instructions in a quick, compliant way, indicating they monitor chat and are willing to align with the emerging norm but do not take a leadership role. They do not attempt to persuade others directly or organize collective strategies around punishment or reward.\n\nLater, they display a dry, somewhat playful tone toward the ongoing punishment of noncontributors. Brief comments such as laughing and a closing remark celebrating a punished target’s losses suggest they derive some amusement or moral satisfaction from norm enforcement. Their tone toward heavily punished defectors is unsympathetic and even a bit taunting, indicating low empathy for persistent free-riders and comfort with their suffering as a consequence of violating group norms.\n\nThey are not very conversational: they rarely respond to others’ specific comments and do not initiate discussions on strategy, fairness rules, or end-game planning. Overall, they are engaged enough to read and occasionally react, but socially reserved and focused more on actions (contribution and punishment) than on verbal coordination.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThis player displays clear horizon awareness but does not use it to unravel cooperation. Their contribution stays high through the final round, including after they have already observed extensive free-riding and intense punishment dynamics. Their one defection occurs close to the end but is not followed by further defection; they return to full cooperation immediately afterward, even though there is no future round in which others could reciprocate. That pattern is inconsistent with a purely backward-induction, payoff-maximizing end-game strategy.\n\nIn contrast, they escalate or at least maintain strong punishment use in the last round, targeting chronic free-riders again despite the absence of any future opportunity to influence behavior. This suggests that their late-game actions are driven more by retributive or norm-expressive motives—wanting defectors to “feel the burn”—than by strategic deterrence. The end game becomes an opportunity to reaffirm norms and express disapproval rather than to cash out selfishly.\n\nThus, when faced with the game’s endpoint, they prioritize moral or expressive goals (punishing violators while still contributing) over maximizing their own final payoff.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey are an active, costly punisher with a clear target profile: individuals who systematically under-contribute (especially those contributing nothing) are punished repeatedly and at nontrivial intensity. They focus almost exclusively on a small set of known free-riders and do not spread punishment broadly. This indicates a selective, norm-based rather than random or spiteful pattern.\n\nThey are willing to incur large personal costs to punish, even when they already know others are also punishing the same targets and when total group contributions—and therefore their own payoff—are being harmed by punishment expenditures. Their repeated attacks on the same defectors, including in the final round, suggest that they value retribution and norm affirmation more than efficient deterrence per coin spent. They do not appear to titrate punishment to the minimum needed; instead, they repeatedly join punishing coalitions even after noncontributors have already been heavily sanctioned.\n\nThe player also occasionally includes intermediate contributors or ambiguous cases (e.g., someone who sometimes cooperates but has a record of non-contribution) in their punishment set, indicating that once a “defector” label is applied, they maintain a punitive stance even if behavior partially improves. Their chat and their willingness to keep punishing in late rounds both point toward a moralistic, somewhat vengeful enforcement style: defectors are not just corrected; they are made an example.\n\nThey never use punishment in apparent retaliation against punishing players or in response to being targeted themselves (they are not heavily punished), which suggests their punishment is directed toward contribution norms rather than personal vendettas.\n\n<REWARD>\nThis player never uses the reward mechanism despite repeated high contributions by many cooperators. They do not provide positive reinforcement to aligned partners, even when the cost-effectiveness of reward is symmetric to punishment. This consistent absence implies that they either undervalue reward as a coordination tool, find it cognitively or emotionally less salient than punishment, or prioritize conserving coins except when expressing disapproval.\n\nThe asymmetry—frequent punishment, zero reward—points to a “stick not carrot” enforcement style. Their social value orientation seems oriented toward punishing norm violators rather than supporting norm followers through direct transfers. Cooperation itself may be seen as its own reward; extra bonuses are not in their repertoire.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey observe and respond to others’ outcomes mainly through the lens of contribution and punishment patterns, not through explicit commentary on payoffs. Their choice of targets aligns with players who routinely earn high payoffs from free-riding, and they contribute to driving those players’ outcomes downward through coordinated sanctions. They seem to derive satisfaction when defectors end up with strongly negative or reduced payoffs, as reflected in their closing taunt after a heavy loss for a chronic non-contributor.\n\nThey appear largely unconcerned with the heavy costs borne by fellow punishers; they continue to join punitive coalitions even when others are clearly overspending on punishment and harming their own payoffs. This suggests that they value the group-level or symbolic outcome—defectors getting hurt—more than they value the financial well-being of those who enforce norms alongside them, or even their own.\n\nThey do not overtly express gratitude or admiration toward high contributors or big punishers, despite those players’ outcomes being visible. Their responses are outcome-sensitive in terms of who is targeted, but emotionally one-sided: schadenfreude toward punished free-riders, neutrality toward cooperators’ success, and indifference to the self-harm of overzealous punishers. Overall, they act as a principled but harsh norm enforcer whose behavior is more driven by making defectors pay than by optimizing aggregate or individual monetary outcomes.", "umap_x": -0.6955942511558533, "umap_y": -0.8285724520683289, "cluster_id": 2, "cluster_size": 40, "cluster_title": "Punishment / Group / Contribution", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around punishment, group, contribution, reward, contributions."}

Their risk tolerance for being exploited is relatively high: they keep cooperating despite repeated evidence of persistent zero contributors. There is no clear sign that they condition contributions on fairness or reciprocity; instead they act as a consistent “pure cooperator” who maintains cooperation regardless of others’ deviations.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nTheir communication style is brief, affiliative, and norm-conforming. Early on, they affirm cooperative norms and signal alignment with those calling for high contributions. They respond occasionally to group comments but do not initiate strategy discussion or attempt to lead coordination; instead, they echo and endorse existing norms in a low-key way. When exploitation or punishment is discussed, they voice support in principle but do not dominate the conversation. Their tone stays light and somewhat humorous even when outcomes are negative, suggesting emotional stability and low reactivity. They occasionally comment empathetically on others’ misfortunes or extreme outcomes, indicating social awareness and mild concern but not outrage. Overall, they engage selectively rather than constantly, preferring short, socially attuned remarks over detailed persuasion or argument.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nAwareness of the game horizon is observable indirectly: they know there is a final round but do not change their behavioral pattern as the end approaches. They maintain full contributions until the last round and continue to use reward at the very end rather than hoarding payoff, so there is no visible end-game defection or sharp strategic shift. Their final-round behavior remains prosocial and consistent with their earlier pattern, suggesting either a principle-based cooperative stance or low focus on backward induction. They do not push for last-round coordination explicitly in chat, nor do they adjust punishment or reward intensity at the end beyond a small, positive reinforcement.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey are generally reluctant to punish and only do so once, despite multiple salient free-riders and repeated public calls for punishment. When they finally punish, they target a clear, long-term non-contributor who has been repeatedly highlighted by others, and they use the minimum punishment intensity available. This suggests they accept norm enforcement in principle but prefer to stay at the mild, selective end of the spectrum. Their earlier statement about “time for some punishment” is not followed by their own punishing behavior in that moment, indicating a gap between verbal endorsement of punishment and personal willingness to spend on it. They never use punishment vindictively or in response to being personally harmed; instead, their lone punishment aligns with group-directed deterrence of a chronic defector. Overall, they are a weak, late-joining punisher who acts more out of group-aligned duty than strong retributive motivation.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey show a clear and repeated willingness to reward, using it more often than punishment. They reward only high contributors in periods where cooperation is high and stable, which implies a conditional positive reinforcement strategy focused on cooperators rather than on borderline or mixed types. They choose different cooperative targets over time, suggesting a diffuse, group-oriented rewarding style rather than building a dyadic reciprocal relationship with a single partner. Reward intensities are minimal, consistent with a low-cost, symbolic signal rather than a large strategic investment. They do not appear to reward in direct response to being rewarded themselves (they are never rewarded), so their rewarding is not obviously reciprocal; it looks more like generalized gratitude or support for the cooperative norm. Using reward in the final round, when there is no future to influence, suggests intrinsic satisfaction with rewarding or a desire to end on a “positive” social note, rather than pure forward-looking incentive engineering.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey monitor end-of-round outcomes enough to comment on notable extremes, especially when someone suffers a very large negative payoff due to group punishment. Their remarks frame such outcomes as “rough” or painful rather than deserved triumphs, indicating some empathy even toward those heavily punished. They do not show schadenfreude or push for harsher sanctions based on these results. When their own payoff declines due to others’ low contributions, they react with a short, understated negative exclamation rather than anger, blame, or retaliatory behavior. They do not visibly adjust contributions or sanctioning intensity in response to others’ costly punishment habits or to swings in individual payoffs; their own behavior remains stable. Overall, they are attentive but emotionally moderate: they register others’ outcomes, feel for those hit hard, and occasionally verbalize this, but they do not let observed payoffs drive large strategic changes.", "umap_x": -0.28247398138046265, "umap_y": -1.2900323867797852, "cluster_id": 2, "cluster_size": 40, "cluster_title": "Punishment / Group / Contribution", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around punishment, group, contribution, reward, contributions."}
{"experiment": "4Z5uDYPcFsmMAnBJf", "participant": "TzB5CfRi6HZpFfi4j", "game_finished": true, "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a persistent, near-pure free rider with a single late cooperative deviation. They almost always keep their entire endowment and let others fund the public good, despite a very high social return to contribution. The pattern is extremely stable: they repeatedly choose the non-cooperative option even after being explicitly called out and heavily punished for it. Their one cooperative act comes late and is not sustained, suggesting experimentation or momentary concession rather than a genuine shift in norms. There is no sign they condition their behavior on others’ generosity; they continue to free ride even when almost everyone else contributes fully and average contributions are high. Fairness concerns appear very weak or absent: they accept being the unique or near-unique non-contributor in a highly cooperative group. From a risk perspective, they show high tolerance for social and monetary risk: they maintain free-riding through severe sanctioning and public naming in chat.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThey do not speak in the chat at all. They ignore direct social pressure, explicit naming, and coordinated calls for sanctions, offering no defense, apology, justification, or explanation. This silence suggests a strongly disengaged or non-communicative style: they neither attempt to persuade others, coordinate on strategies, nor repair relationships after being targeted. They also do not acknowledge information others provide (e.g., clarifications about the interface or contribution logic). Overall, their communication style is complete non-engagement: they rely entirely on action choices and appear indifferent to conversational norms and reputational dialogue.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThey show awareness of the game horizon only indirectly through behavior changes: near the end, they briefly switch to full contribution and then revert to non-contribution in the very last round. This single cooperative move late in the game could reflect testing whether sanction intensity will drop near the end, a last-moment attempt to blend in, or concern about cumulative payoff before the game closes; the evidence is ambiguous. There is no progressive decay of cooperation, because they are non-cooperative almost the entire time. Instead, the end of the game brings a short-lived spike in cooperation followed immediately by a return to free riding. They do not appear to use the final round to retaliate, reward, or signal anything via punishment or reward mechanisms.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey never use punishment, despite being repeatedly and heavily punished themselves. They refrain from sanctioning even when others explicitly call for punishing free riders like them and name them directly. This suggests they are either unwilling to incur costs for norm enforcement or are strategically focused only on preserving their own payoff stream, ignoring the potential long-term benefits of deterrence. There is no evidence of retaliatory punishment: despite severe and repeated deductions, they never punish back, which implies low interest in revenge or in influencing others’ punishing behavior. They also do not punish other low contributors, even when those others exist; they show no sign of selective norm enforcement. Overall, they behave as a pure non-enforcer who absorbs sanctions without using the punishment tool at all.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey never reward anyone, even when others contribute fully and sustain high levels of cooperation. This indicates no inclination to positively reinforce pro-social behavior, no visible gratitude toward high contributors, and no strategic use of rewards to shape future behavior. Given that they also do not punish, they entirely abstain from second-order pro-social tools. Their stance is consistent with a narrowly self-regarding payoff motive: they appear unwilling to pay any cost to influence others, whether through positive or negative incentives.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey are repeatedly the target of very substantial punishment, including extreme sanctioning in some rounds, and see that others are spending large amounts to enforce cooperation. Nevertheless, they largely persist in free riding. This implies either (a) very low responsiveness to others’ sanctioning behavior, (b) strong commitment to their initial strategy, or (c) low sensitivity to the disutility of being punished within the experimental frame. Their one switch to cooperation follows an extended period of punishment and social shaming but is not maintained, suggesting that punishment can trigger a temporary behavioral change but does not durably alter their underlying preference or norm. They do not mirror others’ strong willingness to incur costs for norms: even when observing massive punishment expenditures by others, they do not start punishing or rewarding. They appear to treat others’ outcomes mainly as background information, not as guidance for their own behavior. Their lack of chat reaction to comments about their negative payoffs and “rough” treatment further supports an emotionally opaque or indifferent presentation; whether they feel upset, amused, or resigned is unknown, but they do not express it.", "umap_x": -0.18196989595890045, "umap_y": -0.5553408861160278, "cluster_id": 4, "cluster_size": 43, "cluster_title": "Punishment / Contribution / Reward", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around punishment, contribution, reward, cooperation, behavior."}
{"experiment": "4Z5uDYPcFsmMAnBJf", "participant": "XapD84w5S9DedSpNY", "game_finished": true, "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a predominantly self-interested free-rider with intermittent, seemingly strategic full contributions. They almost always take the entire endowment, only occasionally switching to full cooperation when it either aligns with group pressure or is low-risk to do so. Their contribution pattern is binary (all or nothing) and alternates between free-riding and cooperating without a clear, stable trend; this suggests opportunistic, context-sensitive behavior rather than a fixed cooperative norm.\n\nThey demonstrate a willingness to exploit others’ high contributions: they frequently contribute nothing while most others contribute fully, capturing high payoffs while imposing the cost of cooperation on others. There is no sign that they follow a fairness norm based on matching others’ behavior; they continue to free-ride even when almost everyone else contributes fully and even after being targeted heavily with punishment. If they internalize a norm at all, it appears to be that maximizing own payoff is acceptable even when it depends on others’ generosity.\n\nTheir sporadic full contributions appear when social coordination to “contribute a lot” is salient or when the game is clearly ending. This pattern is consistent with a player who understands that contributing can be beneficial when everyone does, but who is unwilling to bear that cost regularly and instead times cooperation when social expectations are strongest or when it is cheap to appear cooperative.\n\nRisk tolerance appears moderate: they are willing to continue free-riding despite clear and severe punishment, suggesting either a high tolerance for interpersonal risk or a belief that the punishment is misdirected or unsustainable. At the same time, they occasionally conform to the cooperative pattern, which may reflect caution about standing out too much, not pure recklessness.\n\nOverall, they fit a “calculating opportunist” type: they understand the public good multiplier and the social logic but primarily aim to benefit from others’ cooperation while keeping their own costs low, stepping into cooperation only when socially or strategically convenient.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nTheir communication is very sparse, minimal, and mostly reactive rather than agenda-setting. They participate in chat only a few times, usually with short acknowledgments or simple assertions. When another player encourages high contribution, they respond briefly in agreement and then initially act contrary to that message, indicating that verbal assent does not necessarily reflect genuine cooperative intent.\n\nThey make one explicit evaluative statement about other participants’ behavior, speculating that some other players may be automated or not fully engaged. This hints at a somewhat cynical or detached view of the group, suggesting they do not fully treat everyone as intentional cooperative partners. There are no attempts to persuade, coordinate punishment, or organize a coalition; they neither call out free-riders nor defend themselves when they become a target.\n\nTone is neutral to slightly dry; there is no visible anger or moralizing even when they are heavily punished. They do not protest or appeal to fairness norms, which implies either emotional restraint or disinterest in engaging socially on justice or reciprocity grounds. Engagement style is low-commitment: they signal that they are following along but do not invest effort in shaping group behavior.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThey clearly recognize the finite horizon and adjust behavior in the final phase. Despite being a habitual free-rider, they choose to fully contribute in the last round, when there is no future opportunity for others to reciprocate or retaliate. This indicates that end-game behavior is not about long-term deterrence or relationship-building; rather, it suggests a desire to align with the apparent group pattern at the close, perhaps as a form of conformity, image maintenance, or simple “finish on a cooperative note” preference.\n\nTheir contributions do not steadily decay or escalate toward the end; instead, their pattern remains inconsistent, with free-riding continuing late and only a final-round cooperative gesture. This implies that they do not follow the classic backward-induction logic of unraveling cooperation, nor do they show a strong, principled commitment to maintain high cooperation all the way through. The final cooperative move appears symbolic or impressionistic rather than part of a calculated long-term reciprocal strategy.\n\n<PU﻿NISHMENT>\nThey never use the punishment mechanism at any point, even when there are clear and repeated free-riders and even when other players strongly call for punishing specific targets. Their non-use persists despite strong social cues encouraging punishment and despite themselves being a major punishment target later on.\n\nThis consistent abstention suggests that they either (a) judge punishment as not worth the cost in terms of payoff, (b) dislike the role of enforcer or moral arbiter, or (c) prefer to free-ride not only on contributions but also on others’ enforcement efforts. Given their payoff-maximizing behavior in contributions, the most parsimonious interpretation is that they see punishment as an inefficient investment that reduces their earnings, even if it might improve group behavior.\n\nThere is no evidence of retaliatory motives: despite being heavily punished, they never punish back. That could reflect emotional detachment, a pragmatic refusal to escalate costly conflict, or a sense that the punishing coalition is too large to challenge. They do not selectively punish low contributors, so there is no sign they seek to shape others’ contributions through sanctions. They are best described as a “non-enforcer,” content to let others bear the enforcement costs while adapting their own strategy largely independently.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey also never use the reward mechanism, even when many others contribute fully and when some other players appear to be using reward occasionally. This indicates that they are not inclined to spend private resources to reinforce good behavior, even when such reward might encourage continued high contributions that would benefit them.\n\nTheir simultaneous avoidance of both punishment and reward fits a purely self-regarding cost-benefit calculus: they are unwilling to incur any individual cost for the sake of changing others’ behavior, whether through positive or negative incentives. The absence of reward behavior when others cooperate strongly also implies limited gratitude signaling or reciprocity concerns; they appear content to benefit from group cooperation without investing back into it.\n\nOverall, they are an “enforcement free-rider”: they rely on others, if anyone, to supply both punishment and reward while they focus on cheap riding of whatever group norm emerges.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey observe and experience extreme punishment but show no explicit verbal reaction to being sanctioned and no behavioral shift toward consistent cooperation afterward. After a particularly severe penalty episode, they continue to free-ride in subsequent decisions, and only sporadically deviate toward full contribution under strong social or situational salience. This suggests that the punishment regime is not strongly internalized as a fairness signal; instead, they treat it more as a cost of doing business that does not fundamentally alter their strategy.\n\nThey do not comment on others’ payoffs or on the large costs some players incur from punishing. There is no expressed sympathy for heavily penalized targets or criticism of excessively punitive behavior. Nor do they praise or thank generous contributors. This lack of overt emotional or moral commentary toward others’ outcomes indicates a relatively detached or instrumental orientation toward the game’s social interactions.\n\nTheir only interpretive remark attributes others’ slow actions to possibly non-human participation, implying some skepticism about others’ intentionality or competence. That skepticism could help rationalize their reluctance to invest in group welfare: if they suspect that some participants are not truly intentional or responsive, they have less reason to believe that their own cooperative signals or enforcement actions will be understood and reciprocated.\n\nIn sum, when confronted with others’ outcomes—both cooperative gains and heavy sanctions—they remain behaviorally focused on their own payoff stream, with minimal moral engagement or adjustment based on perceived justice or injustice.", "umap_x": 0.020577892661094666, "umap_y": -0.26306867599487305, "cluster_id": 4, "cluster_size": 43, "cluster_title": "Punishment / Contribution / Reward", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around punishment, contribution, reward, cooperation, behavior."}

They always give the full available amount to the public fund, without any observed adjustment in response to group behavior, free-riding, or changing averages. Their cooperation is not contingent on reciprocity: they continue to contribute fully even when others frequently give nothing and when average contributions drop. They do not appear to engage in strategic under-contribution near the end of the game; their behavior remains consistent through the final rounds, indicating low sensitivity to horizon effects and a preference for principled or norm-based cooperation rather than payoff-maximizing defection. They tolerate the risk of being exploited by free riders and do not visibly attempt to hedge against that risk via contribution changes.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThey do not send any chat messages. They show no overt attempts at coordination, persuasion, or social signaling. Their style is entirely silent and observational, with no explicit support or criticism of others’ proposals, no expressions of approval/disapproval, and no visible engagement in group norm formation through language. This suggests a low-visibility, low-engagement social style: they cooperate through actions (high contributions) rather than words. Their lack of verbal response to clear social cues (calls to punish, commentary about noncontributors, jokes about extreme punishments) indicates either indifference to social pressure, a deliberate choice to remain neutral and anonymous in group discourse, or simply a preference for minimal communication (true motive unknown).\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThey show no end-game defection. Contributions remain maximal through the final rounds, and they do not begin using the punishment or reward options even when the game is about to end. This indicates that they either do not prioritize backward-induction reasoning, or they follow a stable cooperation heuristic that does not change with the number of rounds remaining. There is no sign of last-round “clean-up” punishment or reward aimed at expressing judgment, settling scores, or signaling norms once future interactions no longer matter. Their strategic horizon appears short in the sense of “do the same cooperative action each round,” but not in the sense of exploiting end-game opportunities.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey never use punishment, despite persistent and salient free-riding and repeated calls from others to “get” specific low contributors. They refrain from punishing both chronic noncontributors and those who deviate late in the game. This suggests either a strong reluctance to spend resources on negative sanctions, a belief that others will handle enforcement, or indifference to norm enforcement (which one is true is unknown). Their behavior is consistent: even when it is socially popular and repeatedly encouraged to punish specific targets, they do not join in. They also do not use small, symbolic punishment; the absence is complete. This positions them as a non-punitive cooperator: willing to be exploited rather than pay to deter or retaliate. They may implicitly accept a “live and let live” approach, letting payoff differences and others’ actions play out without direct intervention.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey never use rewards, even though several others reward and there are clear opportunities to positively reinforce high contributors (including themselves and other persistent cooperators). This suggests that they do not invest in explicit incentive shaping, even in a positive form. They appear focused on their own contribution behavior and final payoffs, not on engineering the group’s behavior via rewards. Their non-use of reward remains stable across early, middle, and late phases of the game, indicating that they do not switch into gratitude signaling or morale-boosting as the game unfolds. Their type is thus a “pure contributor”: they support the public good by contributing, but not by paying additional costs to socially manage others through rewards.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey do not react in chat to others’ extreme outcomes, such as very negative payoffs due to heavy punishment or high payoffs of free riders. There is no visible schadenfreude, sympathy, or moral commentary. Their punishment and reward behavior does not change as others escalate sanctions; they remain a non-participant in the enforcement dynamics even when those dynamics become dramatic. This indicates emotional and strategic detachment from others’ payoff trajectories: they observe but do not intervene, and they do not appear to update their own strategy in response. Whether they internally approve, disapprove, or remain indifferent is unknown; what is clear is that they keep their own behavior constant and private.

They always contribute their entire endowment, never deviating despite fluctuating group averages, visible free-riding, and heavy punishment dynamics. Their behavior fits a “principled cooperator” type: they treat giving the maximum as the obvious or correct baseline and do not condition their own contribution on others’ behavior, even when cooperation falls or non-contributors are clearly identified.\n\nThey show attention to group performance and efficiency (commenting on totals/averages and noting improvement), but this does not translate into strategic adjustment or experimentation; they appear risk-tolerant with respect to being exploited by free riders. Their fairness norm is “everyone should contribute” in the sense that higher totals are desired and non-contributors are observed, yet they personally continue to bear the cost of full cooperation rather than protecting themselves.\n\nOverall, they prioritize collective payoff over individual short-term gain, and they do not use contribution levels as a tool to discipline or signal to others; contribution is more of a moral or default rule than a contingent strategy.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThey communicate sparsely but purposefully, with a cooperative, constructive, and mildly humorous tone. Early on, they encourage coordinated high contributions and frame the situation in terms of “making the total go up” and “same deal,” which signals an intention to build a shared understanding of the efficient outcome rather than threaten or shame specific individuals.\n\nThey track group performance and explicitly remark on the stability of the average and later on the group “improving,” suggesting they monitor outcomes closely and think in terms of group-level trends rather than isolated incidents. They acknowledge imperfections (“mostly” everyone did a good job) without turning accusatory, maintaining a positive, inclusive tone even when addressing known non-contributors.\n\nThey engage more as a light-touch coordinator and morale booster than as a central leader; they do not drive the punishment campaigns, list offenders, or echo calls to “get” a specific target. At the end, they use a joking, moralizing line aimed at the chronic free rider, mixing humorous wordplay with a normative message about not “polluting” the public good, which is consistent with a prosocial but non-aggressive style. Responsiveness to specific chat comments is limited; they react more to the overall situation than to individual prompts for punitive action.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThey show clear awareness of the game horizon; they refer explicitly to the possibility that the current situation is the end and offer closing remarks about everyone’s performance. Despite this awareness, there is no end-game unraveling in their behavior: they maintain full contributions through the final rounds and do not reduce cooperation as the end approaches.\n\nThey also do not switch into opportunistic or retaliatory use of punishment at the end, even when the social norm of “get the free rider” is well entrenched and others are spending aggressively. Instead, they preserve the same cooperative pattern and close with a light normative reminder rather than strategic exploitation or last-minute revenge. This suggests they are more rule- or principle-driven than horizon-driven; the impending end of interaction does not meaningfully alter their decisions.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey never punish at any point, despite multiple strong triggers: persistent zero contributors are openly identified, group members repeatedly call for punishment, and many others engage in intense, even extreme sanctioning. Their consistent abstention suggests they are either averse to punishment as a tool, skeptical of its net value, or unwilling to incur personal cost to harm others, even in the name of norm enforcement.\n\nThis player observes who is free-riding and sees that free riders are being targeted, but still chooses not to participate. Their behavior is consistent with a “non-punitive cooperator”: they support cooperation with their own behavior but do not engage in costly sanctioning, even when anonymity could protect them from retaliation. There is no evidence of conditional restraint (e.g., punishing only when others don’t); they simply do not punish at all. Motive is ambiguous—could be moral discomfort, efficiency concerns, or low desire to harm—but the pattern is clear: they rely on positive example and group dynamics rather than direct enforcement.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey also never reward anyone, although some others occasionally use rewards. Given their strong commitment to cooperation and their visible attention to others’ contributions, this absence suggests one of two interpretations: either they view the efficient cooperative outcome as expected and not something to pay extra to reinforce, or they are generally reluctant to spend coins on any form of interpersonal intervention, whether positive or negative.\n\nThere is no sign of selective or strategic rewarding of especially cooperative players; even in periods when many players match their full contributions, they keep their own payoff and do not allocate reward. This further supports an “example-setting” rather than “active incentive-design” style: they cooperate themselves and rely on the public structure and others’ responses rather than manipulating payoffs to shape behavior.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey clearly track outcomes: they note the group average, observe improvement over time, and react to how well “everyone” is doing in aggregate. They are aware that some individuals consistently withhold contributions and that others invest heavily in punishing these players, as reflected in their endline humorous moral appeal to the chronic free rider.\n\nHowever, they do not publicly comment on specific deduction magnitudes or mock extreme negative payoffs; they leave the schadenfreude and “feel the burn” sentiments to others. Their only direct reference to an individual’s behavior is couched in a moral/environmental-style slogan rather than gloating over the punished player’s large losses. This suggests they accept that free riders should face consequences but personally prefer soft, normative pressure over explicit celebration of punishment.\n\nThey seem more concerned with collective trajectory than with individual justice accounting. Their comments focus on the total output and “improvement,” with only light, indirect signaling to misbehaving players.

They repeatedly give the full endowment to the public fund in most rounds, including after exposure to persistent free-riding and heavy punishment dynamics. Their pattern suggests they treat full contribution as the default, not as a contingent response to others’ behavior. They briefly deviate once by contributing nothing in a late round, but they immediately return to full contribution in the final round, indicating that defection is an exception rather than a new norm. There is no clear evidence they condition their contributions on who is free-riding in a given round; they continue to give fully even while publicly recognizing slow or inattentive behavior from others. This reflects a strong efficiency orientation and relatively low sensitivity to short-term exploitation. Risk tolerance appears moderate: they are willing to accept lower personal payoffs in order to sustain a cooperative environment, and they do not visibly shift to defensive low contributions even when free-riders are known and persist. Their fairness norm is “everyone should contribute,” but they act on it primarily through punishment rather than by reducing their own giving.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThey communicate rarely and briefly, with a blunt and somewhat sardonic tone. Their first notable message mildly criticizes slow responders and implies impatience or annoyance with others’ inattention or confusion. Later, they use very short, informal reactions (e.g., a brief expression of amusement) in response to group events and, at the end, they make a dry comment highlighting someone’s extremely negative payoff. They do not attempt to lead coordination on contribution levels or punishment targets; they neither instruct others whom to punish nor actively support existing calls to punish, though their own punishment choices align with the group’s norm-enforcement direction. They also do not respond directly to other players’ specific messages, so they appear more observer/commentator than active organizer. Overall, they engage lightly, prefer short quips over extended persuasion, and show no sign of trying to build rapport or alliances.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThey show clear awareness of the finite horizon but do not simply follow classic end-game unraveling. Near the end, they briefly defect by keeping their entire endowment while many others still contribute; this looks like a one-off opportunistic move once payoffs are locked-in soon and reputational concerns beyond the session no longer matter. However, in the very last round they revert to full contribution, suggesting they either still value the cooperative payoff from one more mutual-contribution round or they have a residual norm of “finish cooperatively.” They also choose to punish a known free-rider again in the final round, which indicates that, even in the very last opportunity with no future rounds, they maintain a willingness to pay to sanction norm violators. End-game behavior thus mixes a short, opportunistic defection with persistent norm-enforcement and cooperative identity.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey are highly willing to punish, but in a focused and norm-enforcing way rather than broadly. They only target the most blatant and consistent free-rider, who repeatedly fails to contribute. When they do punish, they spend a relatively large amount on that single target, accepting substantial personal cost to impose strong sanctions. They never punish partial cooperators or high contributors, and they never punish in response to being personally harmed (they are not themselves punished at all), so there is no evidence of retaliation or spite. Their timing aligns with the broader group’s emerging consensus that persistent noncontributors deserve sanctions: they join and later rejoin the “pile-on” against the same free-rider, including in the final round when deterrence for future behavior is no longer possible. This suggests their motive is more about expressing and enforcing fairness norms or moral outrage than about strategic future deterrence. They do not speak about their punishment choices in chat, so they punish silently rather than using punishment as a communicative threat.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey never reward any player despite having repeated opportunities. This holds even when many others are consistently contributing at high levels and some players spend heavily to punish free-riders. Their lack of rewarding indicates a clear asymmetry: they are willing to invest resources to punish defectors but not to positively reinforce cooperation. This may reflect either a skepticism about the efficiency of rewarding, a preference for negative over positive enforcement, or a belief that full contributions are simply expected and do not merit extra compensation. There is no sign of gratitude signaling or strategic attempts to encourage cooperators with rewards.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey appear attentive to others’ outcomes and willing to comment on them, especially when those outcomes are extreme. They notice and remark when someone accumulates a dramatically negative payoff after repeated punishment, reacting with detached amusement rather than sympathy. Earlier, they express mild frustration at the slow or inattentive behavior of some players, implying that they track not only payoffs but also the procedural behavior of others. There is no evidence they adjust their own contributions or reward behavior in response to others’ payoffs; however, their repeated choice to punish the same chronic defector suggests they monitor that player’s continued noncooperation and the group’s escalating sanctions. Overall, they observe the social and payoff structure closely, respond with brief, somewhat mocking commentary, and reinforce the group’s condemnation of chronic free-riders without showing concern for the punished player’s welfare.", "umap_x": -0.5894515514373779, "umap_y": -1.0724846124649048, "cluster_id": 2, "cluster_size": 40, "cluster_title": "Punishment / Group / Contribution", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around punishment, group, contribution, reward, contributions."}

They continue to contribute nothing even when the rest of the group contributes almost fully, and they do not increase contributions to reciprocate or reward the high cooperation of others. The brief cooperative deviation does not align with a change in group behavior or chat content that would clearly explain it, so its motive is unknown; possibilities include momentary confusion, experimentation, or a fleeting attempt to reduce punishment risk, but this is speculative.\n\nThey display a strong tolerance for social and monetary risks associated with free riding. Even after becoming a clear target of punishment and being explicitly called out by others, they maintain their zero-contribution strategy rather than adapting to preserve reputation or avoid further deductions. This suggests that, in this setting, they prioritize maximizing gross personal payoff from the public fund over alignment with group norms or protection from social sanctions.\n\nOverall, their type is a persistent, payoff-focused free rider with very low responsiveness to social pressure and no stable fairness or reciprocity norm evident in their contribution choices.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThe player’s communication is minimal and disengaged. They send a single short message early in the game, which is neutral and non-substantive. They never use chat to explain their behavior, negotiate norms, justify free riding, or respond to being publicly identified as a non-contributor.\n\nThey ignore explicit coordination efforts and moral nudges from others that advocate high contributions and punishment of defectors. Even when they are named in chat as someone who is not contributing, they offer no defense, apology, or pushback. This silence suggests either low interest in social interaction, low perceived value in communicating, or a deliberate choice to avoid drawing further attention.\n\nThey do not attempt to persuade others to adopt any particular strategy and do not use communication to influence punishment or reward patterns. Their engagement style is best described as passive, minimal-participation, and largely indifferent to the social layer of the game.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nTheir strategy shows no visible end-game shift. From early to late rounds, they maintain the same basic pattern of contributing nothing almost all the time and never using the punishment/reward mechanisms. They neither escalate defection at the end nor “redeem” themselves with late cooperation.\n\nEven when the final round is explicitly marked and others use chat to summarize or reflect on the session, they do not adjust behavior or communicate. Their last-round contribution matches their usual defection pattern, and they still refrain from punishing or rewarding despite having just endured significant punishment themselves.\n\nThis suggests they either place little weight on horizon-dependent strategy (e.g., no special concern for reputation carryover or last-round retaliation/reward), or they have a simple, fixed rule (always keep the endowment; never spend on sanctions) that they apply regardless of remaining rounds.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey never use the punishment mechanism, despite clear social calls to punish non-contributors and repeated evidence that others are willing to spend heavily on sanctions. This absence persists even when they personally become a major punishment target.\n\nThere is no sign of retaliatory punishment: after being repeatedly punished, they do not respond by punishing anyone back. There is also no evidence of norm-enforcing punishment toward other low contributors; they do not sanction fellow free riders, even when others explicitly coordinate against them in chat.\n\nTheir non-use of punishment appears consistent and unconditional. This could reflect a strict payoff-maximizing stance that rejects spending on costly sanctions, a reluctance to harm others even when it would be socially supported, or simple disinterest in that part of the mechanism. The transcript does not allow discrimination among these motives, so their underlying reason is unknown. What is clear is that they are a non-punisher type: they accept being sanctioned but never participate in sanctioning.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey never use the reward mechanism at any point. They do not reward high contributors or those who punish defectors, and they do not attempt to cultivate goodwill or offset hostility toward themselves by positively reinforcing others.\n\nThis suggests that they place extremely low value on strategic or reciprocal rewarding, even though the technology is favorable. They do not exploit rewards as a way to signal gratitude, build alliances, or shape others’ behavior. As with punishment, this is consistent with a simple rule of “spend nothing beyond the contribution decision” and a narrow focus on immediate personal payoff.\n\nTheir type is therefore also a non-rewarder: they free ride on others’ cooperation and on others’ willingness to use rewards/punishments, but they never invest in reinforcing cooperation themselves.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey experience substantial punishment multiple times, especially later in the game, and they can observe that it is tied to their own behavior and to group-level coordination against defectors. Nonetheless, they do not change their strategy: they continue to free ride and never punish or reward. This indicates a striking insensitivity—behaviorally—to observed sanctions and to the costs others incur to enforce norms.\n\nThey observe that some players spend very large amounts on punishment (even incurring negative payoffs), and others maintain high cooperation and low sanction costs. There is no behavioral sign that they take these patterns as a cue to align with the cooperative majority or to join the enforcers. Instead, they appear willing to accept reduced net payoffs from punishment while persisting in zero contributions.\n\nThey do not react in chat to others’ extreme losses or punishments, even when outcomes are dramatic or become a topic of humor and commentary. They show no expressed empathy, criticism, or support related to others’ payoffs. Their observable stance toward others’ outcomes is neutral and detached: they treat others’ gains, losses, and sanction expenditures as irrelevant to their own choices, aside from tolerating personal punishment without adaptation.\n\nIn summary, the player is best characterized as a quiet, persistent free rider who ignores social signals and sanction patterns, declines to use any sanction tools, and follows a rigid, non-cooperative strategy despite clear group norms and costly attempts to discipline them.", "umap_x": -0.22658555209636688, "umap_y": -0.6186331510543823, "cluster_id": 4, "cluster_size": 43, "cluster_title": "Punishment / Contribution / Reward", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around punishment, contribution, reward, cooperation, behavior."}
{"experiment": "4Z5uDYPcFsmMAnBJf", "participant": "gEGGvnybrjtcx726q", "game_finished": true, "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a high-variance, opportunistic contributor who clearly understands the social efficiency of full contributions but does not consistently follow it. They alternate between full cooperation and full free-riding, never choosing intermediate levels. Early on, they strongly advocate for high contributions and initially match that message with full contributions, indicating they value or at least recognize the logic of joint maximization. Later behavior shows a pattern of conditionality: they cooperate when it is salient to “do the right thing” or to re-align with the group, and defect in other periods despite most others continuing to contribute. There is no visible attempt to match specific others’ contributions one-to-one; instead, the pattern suggests a loose, self-serving alternation between cooperative “bursts” and free-riding periods. Their willingness to be a visible free-rider in the face of clear group norms against it suggests low aversion to social disapproval in anonymous settings and a relatively high tolerance for the risk of costly punishment. They appear to treat the game as partly experimental or playful, testing how much they can extract while still benefiting from group cooperation.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nTheir communication style is brief, upbeat, and oriented toward promoting cooperation rather than arguing about norms. They initiate early coordination with a clear pro-cooperation message, framing high contribution as obviously beneficial. Later, when cooperation is re-established, they again make a pro-contribution remark that emphasizes the direct payoff benefits, not moral or fairness language. Toward the end, they make a light, slightly teasing observation about a persistent low contributor, using humor rather than moral condemnation. They respond occasionally to others but do not engage in extended back-and-forth or leadership; they make a few strategically placed comments and otherwise remain quiet. Overall, they present as socially smooth, mildly persuasive, and non-confrontational, preferring light humor and efficiency arguments over direct blame.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThey show some awareness of the game’s finite horizon but do not exhibit a dramatic end-game collapse in contribution. Their final-round choice is to cooperate fully, consistent with their alternating pattern rather than a pure backward-induction defection strategy. There is no explicit mention of the remaining rounds in their messages, and their behavior does not sharply change as the end approaches. This suggests they are not primarily driven by formal game-theoretic end-game logic; instead, they continue to mix cooperative and free-riding actions through to the final period. Any end-game effect is at most subtle or absent; they seem comfortable ending on a cooperative note.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey never use the punishment mechanism, despite repeated and obvious opportunities and strong group-level encouragement to do so. This holds even when they themselves are clearly targeted for their own free-riding and even when others are heavily sanctioning known non-contributors. The consistent non-use of punishment, across both cooperative and defecting phases, suggests a strong aversion to spending resources on harming others, regardless of justification. It also indicates that they do not see direct punishment as a necessary tool for enforcing norms or protecting their own payoff; they accept being punished without retaliating. Their type fits a “non-enforcer free-rider/cooperator”: willing to exploit or benefit from others’ enforcement but not willing to incur enforcement costs themselves.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey never use the reward mechanism, even when many players are reliably contributing and even though they verbally praise high contributions in general terms. This indicates that while they conceptually appreciate cooperation, they are not motivated to express gratitude or reinforce it with costly rewards. The absence of both punishment and reward points to a broader pattern: they avoid engaging in second-order sanctioning altogether. They rely on the group’s cooperative structure and on others’ sanctioning behavior without personally investing in either positive or negative incentives.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey frequently observe outcomes that reveal substantial punishment being directed at low contributors and that show their own payoff being reduced by punishment. Despite this, there is no change in their use of the punishment/reward tools, and only a modest, non-monotonic adjustment in their own contribution pattern. They do not comment on specific numeric payoffs, but they do notice and lightly mock a persistent non-contributor at the end, indicating that they track at least who is deviating, even if not the exact magnitudes of sanctions. Their reaction style is detached and humorous rather than outraged or empathetic; they show no explicit concern for extremely negative payoffs suffered by punished players, nor explicit solidarity with them. At the same time, they do not push for harsher treatment; they simply acknowledge outcomes and continue their own mixed strategy. Overall, they treat others’ outcomes more as background information than as signals that should substantially change their own sanctioning or contribution behavior.", "umap_x": -0.1661171317100525, "umap_y": -0.3747938871383667, "cluster_id": 4, "cluster_size": 43, "cluster_title": "Punishment / Contribution / Reward", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around punishment, contribution, reward, cooperation, behavior."}
{"experiment": "4Z5uDYPcFsmMAnBJf", "participant": "jvJ3zAdipfTnBfqCi", "game_finished": true, "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a stable, unconditional high contributor. They always give the maximum allowed amount to the public fund, with no reduction even when others free‑ride, when cooperation weakens, or when they see heavy punishment dynamics. Their strategy is not obviously conditional on others’ behavior; they do not appear to “test” the group or adjust based on past outcomes. This suggests a strong internal cooperation norm or a preference for group efficiency over individual gain, even when others are not fully aligned. They show no visible risk‑sensitivity to being exploited: they maintain maximal cooperation under both favorable and unfavorable group compositions. Fairness concerns, if present, do not translate into contribution adjustment; they tolerate payoff inequities without changing their own giving.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThey do not send any chat messages, despite frequent group communication. They read and implicitly follow cooperative norms expressed by others (e.g., calls to contribute and to maintain high giving), but they never join coordination, complaints, or joking. This indicates a silent, low‑visibility engagement style: they cooperate behaviorally but avoid social persuasion, status‑seeking, or moral grandstanding. They do not correct misunderstandings, join in calling out defectors, or comfort punished players. Overall, they are socially passive but behaviorally prosocial.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nAwareness of the limited horizon is available in the environment, but they do not exhibit any end‑game decline in cooperation. They continue to contribute maximally until the very last round, without shifting to selfish extraction, even when others occasionally reduce contributions and even after it is clear that some players have been heavily punished and are likely to be uncooperative. There is no sign of last‑round opportunism or short‑term payoff maximization. If they reason about the horizon at all, it does not override their cooperative rule.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey never spend on punishment, despite repeated free‑riding by specific players and strong group‑level pressure to punish those players. They also refrain from punishing in situations where nearly everyone else is targeting a clear low contributor and where punishment is widely framed as appropriate or “deserved.” This consistent non‑use suggests either (a) a strong aversion to harming others, even at a small personal cost, (b) a belief that punishment is inefficient or not worth the coins, or (c) indifference to enforcing norms against defectors. Since they continue to cooperate fully without trying to deter free‑riding, their main concern seems to be their own contribution standard rather than norm enforcement. They do not engage in retaliatory punishment; they themselves are never targeted, so their stance about direct retaliation remains unknown.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey also never spend on rewards, even when some others are clear, consistent cooperators and when rewarding could act as positive reinforcement. This indicates a general reluctance to use the secondary mechanism at all—both punishment and reward. Their cooperative behavior is “self‑contained”; they do not try to shape others’ incentives through side payments. They neither signal gratitude nor selectively bolster allies. This may reflect a cost‑minimization stance regarding secondary mechanisms, a belief that contributions themselves are sufficient expression of cooperation, or simple inattention to the potential strategic benefits of reward. Their attitude toward gratitude or reciprocity in this channel remains unknown but behaviorally inactive.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey observe extreme patterns of punishment, including very large losses for some low contributors and large costs incurred by norm enforcers, yet they do not emulate either side. They do not join the punishing coalition, nor do they compensate harshly punished players with rewards. Their own payoff is consistently solid due to high contributions and zero punishment/reward spending, but they do not appear to react to others’ payoffs by changing their behavior. They are robust to social and payoff turbulence: visible suffering of defectors, or heavy spending by punishers, does not make them more punitive, more defensive, or more selfish. They also do not publicly comment on any of these outcomes. Overall, they act as a quiet, principled cooperator whose strategy is largely invariant to others’ fortunes or sanctioning choices.", "umap_x": 0.34433242678642273, "umap_y": -0.592630922794342, "cluster_id": 4, "cluster_size": 43, "cluster_title": "Punishment / Contribution / Reward", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around punishment, contribution, reward, cooperation, behavior."}
{"experiment": "4Z5uDYPcFsmMAnBJf", "participant": "nE4ku9WPBGT2Wbkt8", "game_finished": true, "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a strongly cooperative, near-unconditional full contributor. They reliably place their entire endowment into the public fund in almost all rounds, including early, middle, and final stages. Their behavior does not track short-term changes in others’ average contributions: they continue to cooperate even when free-riding is visible and socially discussed. The single deviation to zero contribution is isolated and not followed by further defection, suggesting experimentation, momentary self-interest, or confusion rather than a stable shift in strategy. They adopt a “socially efficient” norm (maximizing group payoff) more than an “eye-for-eye” fairness norm, willing to keep giving even when some others do not. Their risk tolerance appears moderate-to-high in social terms: they repeatedly invest fully despite clear evidence that some players are exploiting the system.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nTheir communication is minimal, brief, and affiliative. They join in light social alignment (short affirmations to cooperative plans) but do not initiate strategies, call out defectors, or direct others’ behavior. They respond to others’ cooperative framing with simple agreement, indicating they are following the group narrative and are comfortable with the cooperative norm but not inclined to lead or argue. They show no visible hostility or sarcasm and avoid conflictive topics even when others are discussing punishment targets. Overall, they adopt a low-visibility, low-conflict engagement style: present enough to signal they are “on the team,” but not actively steering group dynamics.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThey show almost no classic end-game unraveling. Their cooperation persists through the final rounds, including the very last one, and their use of the lone zero-contribution does not coincide with the final move but appears earlier and is quickly reversed. This suggests they either do not strongly apply backward induction, or they prioritize maintaining a cooperative identity over exploiting the horizon. They appear aware of the multi-round structure (they see the round counter), yet they behave as if consistent contribution is still worthwhile near the end. Their behavior is consistent with a type who values stable norms or self-image as a cooperator more than short-run end-game gains.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey completely abstain from using punishment, even when non-contributors are repeatedly highlighted in chat and heavily sanctioned by others. They do not join punishment “campaigns” against visible free-riders, despite clear social license and strong norm pressure to do so. This suggests either a principled aversion to harming others (even defectors), skepticism about the value of costly punishment, or a preference to leave norm enforcement to others. Their abstention is stable: it does not change as free-riding persists or as some players spend large amounts on sanctioning. They appear to prioritize preserving their own payoff and/or avoiding negative actions more than enforcing fairness through harm.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey very rarely reward and do so only once, in a way that runs against the immediate punitive norm: they grant a small reward to a player who has been heavily punished and is socially targeted. This indicates a limited but meaningful willingness to use positive incentives, potentially as a corrective or supportive signal rather than as a systematic reinforcement of high contributors. The low frequency of rewards suggests they are cautious with costly prosocial actions beyond contribution itself; they may view direct contributions as the main cooperative tool and regard reward as exceptional rather than routine. Their one reward choice hints at some sympathy for disadvantaged or ostracized others, or at least a tendency to counterbalance extreme punishment rather than pile on.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey witness intense sanctioning dynamics, with some players spending heavily to punish and others suffering extreme negative outcomes, but they do not verbally comment on these payoffs or adjust their own punishment/reward behavior toward conformity. Their continued full contributions, absence of punishment, and almost complete absence of reward suggest that others’ payoffs and aggressive sanctioning do not strongly redirect their core strategy. They neither retaliate nor opportunistically exploit those who are weakened by punishment. Their one act of rewarding a heavily punished individual, combined with silence afterward, implies a quiet, non-confrontational stance: they notice imbalances but respond in a subtle, costly-prosocial way rather than by joining punitive trends or openly criticizing them. Overall, they appear somewhat insensitive to social pressure and payoff drama in terms of their own strategic core, maintaining a cooperative, non-aggressive identity throughout.", "umap_x": -0.4436330795288086, "umap_y": -0.5355195999145508, "cluster_id": 4, "cluster_size": 43, "cluster_title": "Punishment / Contribution / Reward", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around punishment, contribution, reward, cooperation, behavior."}
{"experiment": "4Z5uDYPcFsmMAnBJf", "participant": "w9T3tcvXrSpm2sNTt", "game_finished": true, "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a steadfast full cooperator. They always contribute their entire endowment in every round, with no experimentation or decay, even when average contributions fall and when some identified players repeatedly free‑ride. Their strategy indicates a strong internal norm of “cooperate regardless,” rather than conditional cooperation. They appear willing to absorb lower personal payoffs from both contributing and punishing in order to maintain a high-contribution environment. Risk tolerance is high: they keep investing fully in the public fund even when others’ behavior is unstable and when they are already spending heavily on sanctions. Fairness seems defined primarily as “everyone should contribute fully,” and they uphold that standard unilaterally.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThey never speak in chat. They neither initiate coordination nor respond verbally to others’ attempts to organize punishment or explain mechanics. Their engagement is purely behavioral: they respond through contribution and sanction choices without explicit justification. This suggests a silent enforcer style—socially passive but normatively active. They do not use communication to threaten, bargain, or praise; instead, they let punishments carry the social message. Whether this reflects shyness, indifference to chat, or a deliberate “actions over words” approach is unknown.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nAwareness of the game horizon does not change their behavior. They continue to contribute fully through the last round and maintain or even escalate costly punishment against persistent free‑riders at the very end. There is no sign of end‑game defection or relaxation of sanctions; if anything, they appear comfortable using the final round to impose large additional costs on chronic low contributors. This indicates that forward-looking payoff maximization is not their primary driver; preserving or expressing norm enforcement seems more important than exploiting the final opportunity to free‑ride or conserve resources.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey are a highly willing and aggressive punisher, especially toward clear and repeated free‑riders. They target players who systematically contribute nothing or almost nothing, and they direct substantial repeated punishment at these individuals across multiple rounds. They also sometimes punish a partial or late contributor who has previously free‑ridden, signaling that “make‑up” contributions do not fully erase a history of low cooperation. In a few instances they also sanction a player who deviates from full contribution in a context where most others are giving, implying a low tolerance for under‑contribution relative to the emerging norm.\n\nTheir punishment is selective rather than random: they always aim at low or zero contributors, never at clear cooperators, and they do not engage in counter‑punishment or apparent retaliation against those who punish others. They are willing to spend large amounts on sanctions, repeatedly accepting substantial personal payoff reductions to impose strong costs on defectors. This pattern fits a strong altruistic‑punisher or moralistic‑punisher type: they value enforcement of contribution norms enough to forgo material payoffs. Deterrence seems central—their targets are exactly those who undermine collective returns—though whether they care about the emotional “hurting” aspect versus purely strategic deterrence is unknown.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey never reward anyone in the entire game despite many players consistently contributing fully. They even forgo cheap opportunities to reinforce cooperators, despite clearly attending to others’ contributions and outcomes. This indicates a strong asymmetry: they are willing to pay heavily to punish but unwilling to pay even a little to reward. Their cooperative norm is enforced negatively only; they appear to treat full contribution as expected baseline behavior that does not merit extra compensation. Strategic use of positive incentives is absent; they rely exclusively on sanctions to shape behavior.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey closely track others’ contributions and punishment histories, adjusting their targets as patterns emerge. They continue punishing chronic free‑riders even after those players suffer very large accumulated deductions from the wider group, suggesting that they are not easily “satisfied” by the level of suffering imposed; they keep contributing to the pile‑on as long as the defection pattern persists. At the same time, they sometimes withhold further punishment when a prior defector finally contributes fully or when non‑contribution becomes more mixed across players, which hints at some updating: once behavior improves or ambiguity rises, they step back from sanctioning. They never mimic others’ apparent “spite” or inter‑cooperator conflicts; their punishment choices stay focused on those whose contribution is clearly below the group norm. They show no observable envy or response to high payoffs of cooperators, and no sympathy effects toward heavily punished defectors—the severity of others’ losses does not soften their stance. Overall, they behave as a principled, silent cooperator–enforcer: unwaveringly cooperative themselves, highly punitive toward free‑riders, indifferent to using rewards, and largely insensitive to the personal cost of maintaining this norm.", "umap_x": -0.6309568285942078, "umap_y": -0.868888795375824, "cluster_id": 2, "cluster_size": 40, "cluster_title": "Punishment / Group / Contribution", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around punishment, group, contribution, reward, contributions."}
{"experiment": "4Z5uDYPcFsmMAnBJf", "participant": "wRraedvynMNyJ3x7c", "game_finished": true, "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a strong, almost unconditional cooperator for most of the game. They contribute their full endowment in all but one round, even when others frequently withhold contributions. Their cooperation is not tightly conditional on others’ behavior; they keep giving even when some players repeatedly contribute nothing. Only once do they defect by keeping their full endowment, and this occurs late in the game after a long history of full cooperation and heavy punishment of non-cooperators. This suggests a mix of pro-social orientation and occasional opportunism or experimentation, rather than strict reciprocity. They show tolerance for inequality in the short term, apparently prioritizing maintaining a high group contribution level over maximizing their own payoff every single round. There is no clear sign that they strategically adjust their own contributions in response to individuals’ contribution histories; instead, they almost always choose the cooperative option regardless of who defects.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nTheir tone is blunt, directive, and at times aggressive. Early on they offer a practical clarification to help others understand the interface, which indicates some concern for coordination and group efficiency. They also make at least one offhand geopolitical remark that appears unrelated to the game’s mechanics and may carry a slightly cynical or critical undertone; the precise intention is unclear (low confidence on motive). As the game progresses and free-riding persists, they openly call for punishment and explicitly name targets, pushing others to join in. Their chat escalates from neutral/helpful to rallying language focused on “getting” a particular low contributor. They are not highly conversational or responsive to others beyond these short messages; they engage in targeted interventions rather than sustained dialogue. Overall, their communication style is engagement-oriented but not conciliatory: they attempt to coordinate behavior and sanctions, but with a coercive flavor rather than persuasion through argument or empathy.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThey remain aware of the finite horizon, as shown by their behavior near the end. In the penultimate round, after many rounds of full cooperation, they suddenly keep their entire endowment while still refraining from punishment or reward. This suggests some sensitivity to the approaching end and a willingness to cash in once cooperative norms and sanctioning patterns are established. In the very last round, they return to full contribution but continue to invest in punishing persistent defectors, indicating that, for them, punishing norm violators remains salient even when there is no future opportunity to benefit from their changed behavior. Their end-game behavior blends a mild unraveling of cooperation (one defection) with a continued commitment to enforcing contribution norms through punishment, suggesting that upholding norms and perhaps expressing moralistic frustration matter alongside purely instrumental payoffs.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey are an extremely sanction-heavy player. They invest large cumulative resources in punishment across most rounds, consistently targeting those who contribute nothing or substantially less than the group. The primary triggers appear to be repeated non-contribution and being identified in chat or via contribution tables as chronic free-riders. They show a strong focus on specific low-contributors, repeatedly punishing them across many rounds, and they actively incite others to do the same. At times they extend punishment beyond the most egregious free-riders to include others who deviate from what they likely see as the cooperative norm; in at least one case this includes a player who had been mostly cooperative previously (low confidence on whether this is due to perceived inconsistency or spillover frustration). They never use punishment reactively in response to being personally targeted—there is no evidence they are ever punished—so their sanctions are not retaliatory in that sense. Instead, they resemble moralistic or norm-enforcing punishment, albeit carried out with considerable intensity and some apparent enjoyment or satisfaction, as suggested by their approving comments when a widely punished player ends up with very low payoffs. Their punishment is broad enough that it occasionally looks more like coalition bullying of identified “bad” players than precisely calibrated deterrence.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey never reward anyone throughout the game, despite having many opportunities and clear examples of sustained high cooperation by others. This shows a one-sided enforcement approach: they rely exclusively on negative sanctions rather than positive reinforcement. The absence of rewarding behavior suggests that they either do not value reward as a strategic tool (perhaps viewing it as inefficient), or they place far more emotional or normative weight on punishing defectors than on acknowledging cooperators. There is no sign of gratitude signaling or attempts to use rewards to solidify alliances. Their sanctioning toolkit is purely punitive.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey are attentive to others’ outcomes, especially extreme ones, and appear to derive some satisfaction from seeing heavily punished defectors suffer large negative or very low payoffs. When a chronically non-contributing player experiences a severe net loss, they respond with amusement or approval. They also verbally endorse others’ punitive efforts, congratulating the group when coordinated punishment succeeds. They do not comment on or praise high payoffs for cooperators, nor do they express concern when punishers incur high personal costs to sanction defectors; these heavy costs do not visibly deter them from further punishment. Their reactions indicate that they prioritize seeing justice (as they define it) imposed on free-riders over maximizing everyone’s material welfare. Norm enforcement, especially through collective shaming and financial harm to defectors, is central to how they interpret outcomes.", "umap_x": -0.7476457953453064, "umap_y": -1.040091633796692, "cluster_id": 2, "cluster_size": 40, "cluster_title": "Punishment / Group / Contribution", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around punishment, group, contribution, reward, contributions."}

They always contribute the maximum available amount to the public fund in every decision, without any sign of experimentation, retaliation-based withholding, or end-game decay. Their cooperation is not conditional on others’ behavior; they keep contributing fully even when multiple others free-ride or reduce their contributions. They appear to treat full contribution as a normative baseline rather than a strategic variable. There is no evidence that they adjust contributions in response to punishment patterns, chat, or changing averages. Risk tolerance regarding contribution is high: they repeatedly expose themselves to exploitation by free-riders while maintaining full cooperation.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThe player does not send any chat messages; they remain completely silent throughout. This suggests an avoidance/observation-oriented communication style: they read others’ messages and clearly respond behaviorally to identified noncontributors but do not engage verbally in persuasion, coordination, or norm-setting. They seem to rely on action (especially punishment) rather than words to express disapproval and enforce norms. Their silence also means there is no direct evidence of their emotional tone or explicit beliefs; all inference comes from their contribution and punishment choices.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nAwareness of the finite horizon does not weaken their cooperative behavior. They maintain full contributions through the final decisions and even escalate costly punishment at the very end. Rather than free-riding or softening sanctions as the game closes, they continue to invest heavily in punishing targets even when any deterrent effect can no longer benefit them. This pattern indicates that their enforcement of norms is at least partly non-instrumental: they are willing to incur extreme personal cost to sanction perceived violators even when future payoffs are unaffected. There is no sign of end-game opportunism; instead, the end game is a period of maximal punitive intensity.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThe player is an extremely willing and aggressive punisher, with a strong focus on sanctioning those they see as systematic free-riders. They consistently target participants who contribute nothing or substantially less than the emerging group norm (notably those who contribute zero in many rounds). Their punishment is highly concentrated: they repeatedly hit the same low-contributors with very large sanction amounts, driving the targets’ payoffs deeply negative in multiple instances. They are willing to spend so much on punishment that their own round payoffs become negative, indicating very low concern for personal profit when enforcing contribution norms.\n\nThey almost never punish high contributors or apparent cooperators, and they do not appear to punish randomly; when they punish a player, that player has either contributed nothing or is part of a small group of persistent low contributors. This suggests selective, norm-responsive punishment rather than spite toward the group in general. However, the sheer magnitude of the punishment is extreme relative to what would be needed for deterrence, and it persists even after some targets increase contributions. This points toward a punitive “avenger” or moralistic type: they punish free-riding not only to shape behavior but also as an expression of strong disapproval, with limited regard for efficiency or diminishing returns.\n\nThe player does not appear to use punishment tactically to fine-tune incentives (e.g., moderate sanctions to encourage, then back off); instead, their pattern is “all-in” once someone is classified as a wrongdoer. There is no evidence they retaliate against punishers of themselves (they never receive punishment), so vengeance is oriented at norm violators, not at personal attackers.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey never reward anyone, despite multiple opportunities and the presence of clear high contributors. This strongly suggests that they do not use positive incentives to reinforce good behavior and instead rely purely on negative sanctions. The asymmetry between zero reward and massive punishment indicates a fundamentally punishment-centric enforcement style rather than a balanced reciprocity style. It is unclear whether they are indifferent to rewarding, see reward as inefficient, or simply prioritize punishing defectors over encouraging cooperators; only their revealed preference to allocate all enforcement budget to punishment can be inferred.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThe player clearly attends to others’ contribution and outcome information and adjusts whom they target based on observed free-riding. They repeatedly focus on individuals whose payoffs are high despite low or zero contributions, and they continue to sanction them as long as they remain (or are perceived as) norm violators. They do not show sympathy or restraint when targets already have very low or negative cumulative outcomes; instead, they escalate punishment even when the punished individuals’ payoffs are already extremely negative. This suggests that they care more about enforcing a rule against free-riding than about maintaining any minimum payoff for others.\n\nThey are not observed reacting explicitly to others’ punishment or reward expenditures with their own sanctions; there is no sign of “meta-punishment” (e.g., punishing those who do not punish). However, their punishment choices align with group chat calls to “get” specific low contributors, indicating alignment with group norms despite their silence in chat. They do not respond with any visible change to praise or comments from others; the only clear behavioral reaction is the continued selective and sometimes escalating punishment of persistent free-riders. Overall, they behave as a highly cooperative but harsh norm enforcer who prioritizes severe sanctions on defectors over personal profit or positive reinforcement.", "umap_x": -0.4760073125362396, "umap_y": -0.9790809750556946, "cluster_id": 2, "cluster_size": 40, "cluster_title": "Punishment / Group / Contribution", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around punishment, group, contribution, reward, contributions."}

They always contribute their entire endowment, with no experimentation or adjustment, regardless of how much others give or how payoffs evolve. Their strategy does not appear conditional on others’ average contributions, on the presence of free-riders, or on changing group norms; they keep maximizing the public fund even when others contribute less or fluctuate. This suggests a rule-based or principled orientation toward cooperation rather than a responsive, payoff-optimizing stance. They do not appear risk-averse about being exploited; they tolerate free-riding without reducing their own contributions. Fairness concerns, if present, do not translate into reciprocal cuts in contribution. Overall, they fit a “stubborn altruist” or “unconditional cooperator” profile.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThere is no visible end-game decay: they continue full contributions through to the final round without softening or hedging. Awareness of the remaining rounds is either behaviorally irrelevant or overridden by a fixed rule (“always cooperate fully”). They do not engage in last-round opportunism and do not switch to more self-serving behavior as the horizon approaches. This is consistent with either strong internal norms or a low focus on dynamic strategic reasoning about the game’s endpoint. Any attempt to use the final rounds for strategic signaling via contribution is absent; they simply maintain the same cooperative rule to the end.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey never spend on reward, at any point, despite reward being net-beneficial to the recipient and commonly used by others. They also receive substantial reward across many rounds from others, yet this does not induce them to reciprocate or join the reward norm. Their behavior indicates a consistent “non-rewarder” stance, not an early-round hesitation. Possible motives (all speculative and thus low confidence) include: a preference to conserve personal payoff, a view that contributing is sufficient and side-payments are unnecessary, discomfort with the complexity of rewarding, or indifference to social reinforcement mechanisms. What is clear behaviorally is that they separate cooperation from reward: they fully cooperate but invest nothing in actively promoting or reinforcing others’ cooperation.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey are behaviorally insensitive to others’ payoffs, reward expenditures, or received rewards. Large variations in others’ costs and returns do not lead to any observable shift in either cooperation or reward decisions. They do not appear to “reward the rewarders,” “support the high contributors,” or sanction free-riders through withholding cooperation; they keep contributing fully and never allocate reward regardless of who is doing what. This suggests low reactive responsiveness: they notice enough to continue playing consistently but do not use outcome information as input into a contingent strategy.

They clearly understand that others are generally cooperative and that the multiplier makes contributions socially efficient, yet they do not adopt a consistent fairness norm. Instead, they mix between three modes: not contributing at all while relying on others’ high contributions; fully contributing in some rounds despite others already being cooperative; and occasionally choosing a mid-level contribution. There is no clear, simple conditional rule such as “match others’ average” or “contribute only if others do.” Their behavior suggests experimentation and responsiveness to the group’s overall cooperativeness, but they do not settle into a stable conditional-cooperator pattern. They appear willing to incur substantial personal cost in some cooperative rounds, then abruptly revert to zero, implying relatively low adherence to strict fairness or equity norms and a higher tolerance for exploiting others’ efforts when it seems safe or profitable. Risk tolerance appears moderate: they are willing to expose themselves to being the only cooperator or the only free-rider in a very cooperative group, and they do not systematically avoid outlier positions.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThe player is clearly aware of the finite horizon and adjusts in a non-monotonic way rather than following a smooth decay. They do not simply ramp up free-riding over time; instead, they reintroduce high contributions even after having already defected multiple times. Near the end, they again alternate between full contribution and zero contribution, rather than following a standard end-game unraveling pattern. This suggests horizon awareness without a standard backward-induction logic. They seem to treat later rounds as opportunities both to exploit and to make strong cooperative gestures, perhaps to test whether reciprocity through rewards continues. In the final round, they revert to full free-riding, which is consistent with an understanding that future reciprocity no longer matters, but because they have already free-ridden heavily earlier, the final move looks more like a continuation of opportunism than a sharp strategic shift at the end. Overall, their end-game pattern indicates that they recognize remaining rounds but do not obey a strict “cooperation decays to zero” script; instead, they mix symbolic high-cooperation moves with terminal free-riding.\n\n<REWARD>\nThis player is an extremely heavy and frequent user of rewards, often spending substantial amounts on rewarding others, sometimes to the point of severely reducing their own payoff. They use rewards even in rounds where they contribute nothing themselves, indicating that their rewarding is not limited to reciprocating for having been personally cooperative; they are willing to “buy” cooperation or to encourage others even while personally free-riding. Their threshold for initiating rewards is low: as long as others appear cooperative, they are willing to spend. They particularly reinforce high contributors in generally cooperative environments, apparently trying to sustain or stabilize group cooperation by compensating others. At times, they spend far more on rewards than they receive, suggesting that immediate material payoff maximization is not their sole motive. They appear comfortable playing the role of “social investor,” bearing private costs to create or maintain a cooperative atmosphere.\n\nThey also sometimes reward in rounds where they themselves are high contributors, suggesting that they may be attempting to build or sustain reciprocal reward networks and not only to exploit others’ generosity. However, their reward behavior is not tightly targeted in a clearly rule-based way (for example, only top contributors); instead, it looks broad and sometimes excessive. This points to a type who values pro-social reinforcement and sees reward as the main lever to influence others’ behavior, even at personal expense. At the same time, their willingness to free-ride while still rewarding others shows that their reward giving is not purely altruistic; they may believe that supporting a generally cooperative climate allows them to reap large benefits from occasional or repeated defection.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThe player pays clear attention to others’ contributions and payoffs and reacts strongly to the general pattern of high cooperation and high mutual rewarding around them. When peers are cooperative and some act as strong rewarders, they tend to respond with large reward spending of their own, even if they themselves do not consistently match others’ contribution levels. This indicates sensitivity to the group’s cooperative norm and to the presence of “good citizens.” They do not visibly retaliate against low contributors or high earners through any available means (no punishment exists), nor do they withdraw rewards selectively in a way that obviously targets specific under-contributors. Instead, they seem to reward despite the presence of some lower contributors, focusing more on reinforcing the cooperative core of the group.\n\nThey do not appear to be deterred from rewarding by the fact that some others earn higher payoffs than they do; they sometimes accept lower round payoffs relative to others due to heavy reward spending, which implies tolerance of payoff inequality when it supports what they see as desirable behavior. At the same time, they are willing to free-ride on the cooperative efforts of others even after seeing that others shoulder significant contribution and reward costs, which suggests that empathy for others’ lower net payoffs is limited or at least overridden by strategic considerations. Broadly, they respond to others’ outcomes by attempting to keep the cooperative system running through generous use of rewards, while intermittently exploiting that very system through their own contribution choices. Their type is best described as a “reward-heavy opportunistic cooperator”: someone who invests heavily in pro-social incentives but does not bind their own behavior to strict reciprocity or fairness.", "umap_x": 1.4352165460586548, "umap_y": 0.8856682181358337, "cluster_id": 7, "cluster_size": 36, "cluster_title": "Reward / Contributions / High", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around reward, contributions, high, rewards, contribution."}

They always contribute the entire endowment, without any adjustment to others’ behavior, overall contribution levels, or their own recent payoffs. They do not exhibit exploratory deviations or strategic under‑contribution, even when several group members repeatedly contribute less. This suggests they treat full cooperation as a rule to follow rather than as a contingent response. They appear indifferent to short‑term risk of exploitation and do not hedge against freeriding, implying either a strong efficiency norm (“maximize the public good when MPCR > 0.5”), a moral norm (“always contribute everything”), or both. There is no evidence that they condition on fairness; they do not reduce contributions in response to others’ low or zero contributions, and they do not escalate contributions because they are already at the maximum. Their behavior is stable and non‑reactive over time.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThis player does not exhibit an end‑game decline in cooperation. They maintain the exact same maximal contribution pattern through the final rounds, including the very last period, despite clear information about the finite horizon and the remaining number of rounds. There is no sign of “last‑round defection” or gradual decay. This supports the interpretation that their cooperation is rule‑based or norm‑driven rather than strategically forward‑looking in a standard game‑theoretic sense. Any belief about future reciprocity or reputation is unknown, but behaviorally they do not adjust to the approaching end of the game.\n\n<REWARD>\nThis player never spends any resources on rewards. Across all situations—high or low group cooperation, presence or absence of defectors, early or late in the game—they consistently choose not to use the reward mechanism. At the same time, they steadily receive nontrivial positive rewards from others, indicating that their full cooperation is visible and appreciated by some peers. The fact that they never reciprocate with rewards, despite being a clear high contributor, suggests one or more of the following (all low‑to‑moderate confidence): they may prioritize payoff conservation over costly social signaling; they may conceptually separate “doing my part” (contribution) from “policing or encouraging others” (rewarding); or they may not see the reward tool as necessary or effective. There is no evidence that they selectively reward high contributors or punish low ones via omission; they simply abstain from rewarding everyone. From a strategic standpoint, they behave as a pure cooperator who relies on others’ reward activity but does not engage in second‑order cooperation via incentives.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThis player shows no behavioral response to others’ payoff patterns or reward expenditures. They do not change their contribution when some players incur very large costs to reward others, when low contributors receive substantial net benefits, or when reward activity fluctuates. Their own use of the reward mechanism remains at zero regardless of who is rewarded, who is ignored, or who spends heavily. This indicates low behavioral sensitivity to distributional outcomes or second‑order fairness concerns within the game. They appear tolerant of freeriding and of asymmetric reward flows: they continue to cooperate fully even when some players contribute less yet still enjoy high payoffs, and even when they themselves are differentially rewarded across rounds.

They understand that cooperation is profitable in this environment (the public return per contributed coin exceeds 1), but they do not internalize a strong fairness or reciprocity norm.\n\nTheir contribution levels fluctuate between full contribution, partial contribution, and zero. The pattern suggests they track how generous the group is and periodically exploit high group contributions by contributing nothing while still benefiting from the public pool. When they see widespread full cooperation, they are willing to free‑ride rather than match others’ efforts. They also show no clear tendency to systematically contribute more when others contribute more; instead they mix cooperative and selfish moves without a clear tit‑for‑tat pattern.\n\nThey appear relatively insensitive to individual deviations by low contributors; they are willing to cooperate even in the presence of visible free‑riders elsewhere in the group. Conversely, they are also willing to defect even when everyone else cooperates. This indicates that their primary reference seems to be their own payoff maximization rather than matching the group’s average or enforcing equality.\n\nThe overall strategy balances extraction and participation: they contribute enough across the game to maintain access to a thriving public fund but exploit windows where they can greatly increase their private payoff by contributing nothing. They tolerate inequity in their own favor without apparent discomfort.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThere is no strong end‑game collapse in cooperation. Contributions in the final phase fluctuate similarly to earlier behavior, mixing partial contribution, zero contribution, and full contribution. The player does not shift to a pure free‑ride strategy when the game is about to end.\n\nThis suggests horizon awareness is either weak or secondary to their basic payoff‑oriented conditional style. They continue to use the same mixed strategy rather than explicitly “cashing out” in the final rounds. Any changes in contributions near the end are small and not clearly directional, implying low sensitivity to future interaction length or limited strategic sophistication about end‑game decay.\n\n<REWARD>\nThe player never spends on rewards at any point, despite reward being economically efficient and despite other players regularly using it. They nevertheless receive positive rewards from others multiple times. This indicates that they benefit from the reward system but do not reciprocate.\n\nTheir threshold to spend on social incentives appears extremely high: they forgo all opportunities to use rewards to encourage high contributors or build coalitions, even when others use rewards heavily. They also do not appear to use reward strategically to shape others’ future behavior or to signal gratitude. The consistent non‑use of reward, alongside their willingness to free‑ride on others’ contributions, strongly suggests that they treat reward as a pure cost with no personally valued social or strategic upside.\n\nIn type terms, they are a strict reward‑nonuser: a player who responds to incentives but will not incur costs to provide them.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThe player observably adapts their contributions in light of others’ behavior and outcomes, but in a way consistent with private payoff maximization rather than norm enforcement. When others sacrifice heavily on rewards or contributions, the player does not increase their own contributions or start rewarding to reciprocate; instead, they often take advantage of the resulting high public good while preserving their own coins.\n\nThey show no evidence of targeting or supporting specific individuals: despite seeing which peers repeatedly incur large reward costs and which ones contribute fully or defect, they do not change their reward behavior (always zero) and only loosely adjust their contribution level. This suggests a low emotional or identity engagement with others’ payoffs; others’ outcomes matter mainly insofar as they change the overall public fund and thus the player’s own payoff.\n\nThey tolerate large payoff differences among others, including cases where some players earn far less because they spend heavily on rewards. The focal player does not move to “protect” exploited cooperators or “punish” exploitative free‑riders, even indirectly via increased contribution.

For most of the game, they contribute the full endowment, regardless of variation in others’ behavior, including when some group members give substantially less or nothing. This indicates a strong internal preference for cooperation or fairness that is not tightly conditioned on immediate reciprocity. They do not appear to be strategically matching others’ average contributions in a fine-grained way; instead, they sustain a “default high” contribution level and only slightly reduce it late in the game. When they do lower contributions, they still remain above or roughly at the group average, suggesting they avoid exploiting others and retain a cooperative self-image even when loosening their standard. Their behavior is consistent with a pro-social or norm-driven type who values the public good, with relatively low sensitivity to short-term payoff losses from free riders. Risk tolerance is moderate: they are willing to risk being exploited by low contributors for many rounds, only adjusting slightly, rather than quickly cutting cooperation in response to others’ under-contribution.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThis player shows some awareness of the approaching end but does not abandon cooperation. In the later part of the game, contributions decrease somewhat and become more variable, implying that horizon effects begin to matter. However, they do not shift to full defection even in the final round; instead, they keep contributing a substantial amount. This pattern suggests they either maintain a cooperation norm to the end, are uncomfortable fully exploiting the final-round logic, or are uncertain about how aggressively to adjust at the horizon. Their limited late-game reductions imply only a mild end-game effect: they appear to relax their strict high-contribution rule rather than reverse it. There is no clear evidence of sophisticated forward-looking strategizing tied to anticipated future rewards, since they rarely use the reward mechanism and do not systematically alter behavior in response to reward patterns near the end.\n\n<REWARD>\nThis player almost never spends on rewards and only uses the reward mechanism once, and even then at a modest level. Given that they themselves repeatedly receive rewards from others, their continued non-use of rewards suggests they do not treat rewarding as a necessary tool for sustaining cooperation. This may reflect a preference to conserve private payoffs, a belief that contribution behavior should stand on its own without extra incentives, or uncertainty about how to reward optimally. They do not systematically reciprocate the rewards they receive; there is no consistent move from having been rewarded to then investing in rewarding others. They also do not appear to use rewards to shape others’ contributions strategically (for example, to target borderline or improving contributors), most likely because they almost never reward. Overall, they act as a “cooperative non-rewarder”: they contribute a lot but largely leave incentive provision to others.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThis player appears relatively insensitive to others’ payoff patterns and reward expenditures. They maintain high contributions even when some players invest heavily in rewards or free ride on contributions, and they do not adjust their own reward behavior in response to seeing others spend or receive large amounts. There is no sign of targeted response to especially high or low earners; neither inequality in payoffs nor visible “sucker” behavior by heavy rewarders leads them to punish, imitate, or counterbalance via their own reward choices. Their minimal use of rewards despite frequently benefiting from them suggests they do not feel compelled to repay or equalize outcomes through the incentive mechanism. Instead, they seem to focus on maintaining their own cooperative contribution pattern while tolerating a wide range of others’ outcomes. This points to a personality style that is steady, norm-guided, and somewhat detached from strategic, outcome-based adjustments: they notice others’ behavior enough to slightly relax contributions when the group’s cooperation is clearly lower, but they do not engage deeply with managing others’ payoffs or reputations.", "umap_x": 1.317914366722107, "umap_y": 0.44461917877197266, "cluster_id": 7, "cluster_size": 36, "cluster_title": "Reward / Contributions / High", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around reward, contributions, high, rewards, contribution."}

This pattern indicates a strong internal norm for full cooperation rather than a reactive, tit-for-tat style. They tolerate being exploited financially and do not reduce their contributions even when some peers repeatedly contribute nothing or less than the group. Risk tolerance is high with respect to depending on others’ contributions and to sacrificing own short-term payoff for group efficiency. They appear fairness-oriented at the group level (maximizing total surplus) but do not enforce distributive fairness via contribution adjustments; instead, they separate contribution decisions from sanctioning or reciprocity concerns and keep contributing fully regardless of others’ deviations.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nAwareness of the time horizon does not erode their cooperation. They continue to fully contribute in the late and final rounds without any sign of end-game defection or even partial reduction. There is no observable last-round opportunism: they do not exploit the inability of others to respond in future rounds. Their reward spending in the late game remains positive and non-minimal, showing no clear shift to purely self-interested hoarding as the end approaches. Overall, they behave as if cooperation and prosocial rewarding are valuable in themselves, not only as long-run strategic investments. Any subtle fine-tuning of reward amounts across the final rounds is small compared with their stable cooperative baseline, so if they incorporate the approaching end at all, they do so weakly; their core pattern is end-game-resilient cooperation.\n\n<REWARD>\nThis player frequently and consistently uses the reward mechanism, often at a nontrivial personal cost. They do not restrict rewards to a single episode: reward spending appears in most rounds, including mid-game and late-game, which suggests a stable preference for reinforcing cooperative behavior and/or reciprocating help. Because rewarders are not identifiable, the player cannot obtain direct reputational benefits from rewarding specific individuals. Nonetheless, they keep spending, which implies either a genuine prosocial preference for rewarding cooperators, a desire to sustain a cooperative group climate, or intrinsic satisfaction from “thanking” others via payoff boosts.\n\nTheir reward behavior is selective rather than maximal. They do not exhaustively reward everyone; instead they allocate a modest-to-moderate amount each round, implying some prioritization—likely toward higher contributors or toward those they infer are cooperative rewarders themselves. They neither completely withdraw rewards in response to group contribution declines nor escalate to extreme reward spending. This suggests a calibrated style: they maintain positive reinforcement, but with some attention to their own payoff constraints.\n\nThey sometimes receive substantial rewards from others and do not drastically alter their own reward behavior afterward, indicating that while they likely appreciate reciprocity, they do not condition their rewarding solely on being rewarded. Overall, they act as a steady, prosocial rewarder whose primary function is to support and recognize cooperation in the group, rather than to optimize narrow self-gain or send strategic, individually targeted signals.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThe player pays implicit attention to others’ contributions and end-of-round payoffs but does not respond in a punitive or retaliatory way. When others defect or free-ride, they do not reduce their contributions and do not have access to punishment; their observable response is to continue cooperating and still engage in some rewarding. This indicates a high tolerance for payoff inequality and exploitation, at least behaviorally. They do, however, appear sensitive to broad patterns: they do not ramp up rewards when low contributors benefit and high contributors are under-rewarded, nor do they go to extremes to “correct” payoff distributions. Their adjustments in reward spending over time are moderate, suggesting that they register others’ outcomes but avoid strong emotional or reactive swings.\n\nThey seem comfortable with others earning more or less than themselves as long as the public fund is well supported. When some peers spend heavily on rewards and take significant payoff losses, this player does not mirror such extremes; they maintain intermediate reward costs, which points to a measured style—supportive but not self-sacrificing to the point of severe personal loss.

Their pattern indicates that they value a high public fund and are not locked into pure free-riding or pure unconditional altruism. They are willing to contribute nothing when it is privately profitable and socially safe (others are reliably contributing), then quickly re-establish high contributions afterward. This suggests a conditional cooperator who experiments with opportunistic defection but continues to support group efficiency overall. They do not insist on strict equality; they tolerate others contributing less than them without a consistent downward adjustment. Risk tolerance appears moderate: they sometimes expose themselves to being exploited by low contributors, but not consistently enough to be classified as purely risk-seeking or purely risk-averse. Their behavior points to someone who wants cooperation to work, but is comfortable occasionally exploiting the system when it seems unlikely to destabilize group norms.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nAwareness of the finite horizon does not lead to a simple monotonic decay in cooperation. The player both withholds and restores full contributions in late rounds. They do not follow the classic backward-induction pattern of progressively reducing contributions toward zero as the end approaches. Instead, they maintain or even reassert full contributions in some of the final rounds, despite no future opportunities for reciprocal benefit. At the same time, they are also willing to fully free-ride late in the game while still engaging in costly reward, implying that their late-round choices are guided by a mix of opportunism and expressive or normative motives rather than a pure payoff-maximizing end-game strategy. Overall, they show horizon awareness (changing contributions and reward costs) but do not collapse into universal defection; their cooperative stance remains important to them through the end.\n\n<REWARD>\nThis player is an active and persistent rewarder. They spend on rewards in almost every round, including when it is personally costly and not obviously profitable in terms of immediate net payoff. They appear to use rewards primarily to support and encourage cooperators rather than to punish low contributors indirectly. Their reward giving is not tightly tied to their own contribution level; they continue to reward even in rounds where they contribute nothing, indicating that reward behavior is driven more by perceived norms of cooperation than by strict reciprocity for their own actions. They show willingness to invest substantial coins into rewards in some rounds, suggesting they treat rewarding as an important tool for sustaining or expressing approval of cooperative behavior. The pattern suggests a “pro-social incentivizer” type: they likely believe that rewarding cooperators stabilizes high contributions and may also express gratitude or group-mindedness, even if direct personal returns are unclear in the short run. Their reward choices do not appear purely self-serving; they sometimes sacrifice significant payoff to sustain this reward strategy.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThe player is sensitive to others’ contribution and reward behaviors and adjusts in a nuanced, non-retaliatory way. When others free-ride while the group remains cooperative, the player is willing to temporarily exploit that situation but does not escalate into a permanent breakdown of cooperation.

They do not respond to others’ costly or extreme rewarding by abandoning their own cooperative stance; instead, they persist in using the reward mechanism, suggesting they interpret others’ prosocial spending as a shared norm worth joining rather than as a signal to pull back. They do not show evidence of using reward patterns as a targeted response to specific payoff outcomes; since identities of rewarders are hidden, they cannot reward or avoid particular benefactors, and their behavior is consistent with that constraint.

They sometimes reduce contributions slightly near the end and sometimes restore them to the maximum, so there is no consistent terminal defection pattern.\n\nThis suggests they either do not adopt a backward-induction mentality or do not prioritize it over maintaining cooperative norms. They behave as if sustaining cooperation through the final rounds is still worthwhile, perhaps because they anticipate others doing so, or because they value the cooperative pattern itself rather than purely end-of-game payoff maximization. There is no sign of opportunistic exploitation in the last rounds.\n\n<REWARD>\nThe player never spends on rewards despite repeated opportunities and despite receiving rewards themselves in multiple rounds. This is stable and unconditional: they do not reward high contributors, do not reciprocate to those who seem supportive, and do not attempt to strategically encourage cooperation through positive incentives.\n\nTheir zero-reward strategy holds in periods when others are extensively rewarding peers and when the environment is cooperative. This suggests that either they view the reward mechanism as not worth the cost, they are strongly payoff-protective with respect to direct expenditures beyond contributions, or they simply adopt a “no-cost sanctioning/reward” stance as a heuristic.\n\nBecause they continue to cooperate without rewarding, they appear to rely on others’ propensity to use rewards, effectively free-riding on the reward system while supporting the public good via contributions. Their behavior does not display gratitude signaling through rewards, even when they personally benefit from others’ rewards.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThe player observes substantial variation in others’ spending on rewards and in their resulting payoffs, yet they do not visibly adjust through either rewarding or significant withdrawal of contributions. High spenders on rewards see their payoffs reduced; some players frequently abstain from rewards and maintain higher take-home amounts. The focal player aligns with the latter group behaviorally, indicating that they notice, or at least behave as if they notice, that direct reward spending is costly relative to its benefits.\n\nThey also see that high contributors often receive extra income through rewards, including themselves on several occasions. Nevertheless, they do not copy this behavior by starting to reward others. Their cooperative level stays relatively high even when those who free-ride on contribution or spend heavily on rewards end up with higher or similar payoffs. This suggests a kind of payoff awareness combined with a limited willingness to intervene in others’ outcomes.\n\nTheir reaction to others’ outcomes is muted and asymmetric: they maintain contributions in an environment where certain players’ payoff patterns show clear strategies (e.g., heavy rewarding or persistent low contribution), but they neither punish via contribution cuts nor reward via the mechanism. They appear to accept outcome disparities as a byproduct of the game structure rather than something to correct, prioritizing a simple, consistent play style over active management of others’ payoffs.", "umap_x": 1.2514907121658325, "umap_y": 0.6244049072265625, "cluster_id": 7, "cluster_size": 36, "cluster_title": "Reward / Contributions / High", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around reward, contributions, high, rewards, contribution."}

They typically give the full endowment to the public fund and only rarely reduce their contribution, and when they do, they still stay near or above the group average. Their cooperation is not rigid: they adjust downward in some mid and late stages when others’ contributions or overall efficiency decline, suggesting conditional cooperation rather than unconditional altruism. They appear aware that full contribution is socially efficient, but they do not enforce a strict fairness rule tied to others’ exact behavior; instead, they tolerate some free-riding while still maintaining high personal contributions. There is no evidence that they ever exploit the group by contributing much less than others for personal gain; even their lower contributions remain compatible with a cooperative self-image. Their risk tolerance is moderate: they are willing to “take the risk” of contributing fully even after seeing low contributions or erratic reward use by others, but they occasionally hedge by holding back part of their endowment when group cooperation or reward patterns look unstable.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nAwareness of the game horizon is present but does not trigger a stark end-game collapse. Early, middle, and late phases all show a predominantly cooperative pattern, with only mild reductions rather than a systematic drift to free-riding. In the very last round, they still contribute fully despite having no future rounds in which reputation or reciprocity could matter, indicating that their cooperative behavior is not purely driven by backward-induction logic or fear of future loss. At the same time, their use of reward becomes more selective and sometimes shuts off when approaching the end, consistent with a recognition that future behavioral change in others is limited. Overall, they maintain cooperation into the final round but gradually reduce costly prosocial “extras” when the remaining horizon shortens, revealing a mix of intrinsic cooperation and instrumental reasoning.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey are a frequent and relatively heavy user of reward, often spending a substantial portion of their payoff to benefit others. They use reward in a broadly pro-social way that targets cooperators rather than defectors, indicating an intention to reinforce high contributions. They do not use reward as self-serving manipulation (e.g., they do not systematically reward low contributors to buy favor); rather, reward behavior tracks others’ apparent cooperativeness, suggesting a desire to sustain group norms. Their willingness to spend heavily persists over much of the game, even when others’ reward decisions are noisy or when they themselves are not always rewarded, which implies that they value norm reinforcement more than immediate personal payoff maximization. However, they are not blindly generous: at some points they suspend reward or cut back sharply, especially when the environment becomes less cooperative or when the marginal impact of reward appears lower. This indicates strategic prosociality—reward is used as a tool to shape behavior, not as a fixed moral rule. They do not appear to systematically reward in response to being rewarded themselves; any gratitude or reciprocity is present but not clearly dominant over an efficiency- and contribution-based targeting rule.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey attend to both others’ contributions and their net outcomes, including how much others spend on reward. Their behavior suggests they infer types from these outcomes: they continue to cooperate with and often reward those who both contribute substantially and do not exploit reward excessively, while showing less willingness to support those who contribute little or whose reward use appears inefficient or erratic. Large reward expenditures by some players that substantially cut those players’ own payoffs do not induce imitation; instead, this player maintains more restrained or patterned spending, implying that they treat extreme generosity as informative but not normative. When the group outcome deteriorates—through lower total contributions or scattered reward patterns—they respond by trimming either their own contribution, their reward, or both, indicating sensitivity to the overall payoff structure and to perceived instability. They do not retaliate or try to “correct” others via negative reward patterns, but they do quietly adjust their own prosocial investments downward when they see others gaining high payoffs through free-riding or misaligned reward use. Overall, they interpret others’ outcomes as signals of the reliability and cooperativeness of the group and adapt their own cooperative and rewarding intensity accordingly, while maintaining a baseline commitment to contributing more than a purely self-interested player would.", "umap_x": 1.3775129318237305, "umap_y": 0.7315268516540527, "cluster_id": 7, "cluster_size": 36, "cluster_title": "Reward / Contributions / High", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around reward, contributions, high, rewards, contribution."}

They always allocate their full endowment to the public fund and never deviate, regardless of others’ past behavior or current contribution pattern. They do not appear to condition their own contribution on free-riding, partial contributions, or fluctuations in group averages. This indicates a strong internal cooperation norm or rule-based strategy rather than a reactive, payoff-maximizing approach. They tolerate the risk of being exploited by low contributors and do not attempt to hedge against it by reducing their own contributions. They show no evidence of experimenting with different contribution levels, suggesting either a firm prior commitment to full cooperation or a preference for simplicity and consistency over strategic adjustment. Their fairness norm appears to be that contributing fully is “the right thing,” independent of whether others match that standard.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThere is no observable end-game decay in their cooperation: they continue to contribute fully through the final round, with no sign of ramping down as the horizon approaches. Their willingness to spend on rewards also persists into late rounds; while the exact magnitude varies over time, there is no systematic withdrawal of reward activity at the end. They behave as if the shadow of the future is either not central to their reasoning or is dominated by a stable preference for cooperation and reinforcement, even when future reciprocation is unlikely or impossible. This suggests they either do not engage in backward induction or they prioritize normative or intrinsic motives over final-round payoff optimization. Their behavior is consistent with an “always-cooperate, keep-rewarding” pattern rather than a strategic wind-down.\n\n<REWARD>\nThe player is an active and persistent rewarder, spending a meaningful portion of their payoff on rewarding others in almost every round. They nearly always use the reward mechanism, and never escalate to zero-reward abstention as a protest or cost-saving reaction. Rewarding is not tightly contingent on immediate payoff position: they keep rewarding even when it is personally expensive or when their own earnings are not especially high. This implies that they value reinforcing cooperation (or expressing approval) more than maximizing short-term personal income.\n\nWhile exact recipients are not visible, their reward use correlates with environments where many others contribute high amounts. They continue rewarding even when some players repeatedly contribute little, indicating that they likely target high contributors rather than attempting to “convert” chronic low contributors with extra rewards. They do not appear to strategically withhold rewards from high contributors in later rounds to save payoff, which points to a more principled than tactical use of reward.\n\nThey also receive substantial rewards from others, especially in many cooperative rounds. They do not visibly react by changing their reward spending in direct proportion to how much they personally receive. This suggests they use reward to uphold a general cooperative climate, not merely as tit-for-tat reciprocity for personal gains. Their pattern is consistent with a “prosocial rewarder” type: willing to incur consistent costs to sustain or encourage group cooperation, without strong evidence of fine-tuned, payoff-optimizing calibration.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThis player appears sensitive to the overall cooperative structure of the group but not in a punitive or retaliatory sense. When others’ contributions are high and many players are giving up a lot of income to reward, they maintain or increase their own reward spending rather than free-riding on others’ enforcement efforts. When some players contribute little or spend heavily in idiosyncratic ways (for example, burning many coins on rewards or staying at low contribution levels), the focal player does not respond by reducing their own contribution or stopping reward use. Instead, their strategy remains cooperative and supportive.\n\nThey do not exhibit outcome-based opportunism: they never switch to low contributions just because others’ payoffs from low contributions look attractive in some rounds. Similarly, they do not appear to “punish” successful low spenders by withdrawing cooperative behavior. They seem relatively indifferent to rank in the payoff distribution; they keep playing the same high-cooperation, reward-using strategy whether they are among the higher or lower earners in a given round.\n\nPatterns in others’ reward costs and earnings do not induce them to engage in strategic exploitation of generous rewarders (e.g., they do not reduce their own reward spending to free-ride on others’ costly generosity). Instead, they behave in a way that supports a norm: if others are investing in rewards and contributions to maintain cooperation, they also invest, even at meaningful personal cost. This points to a belief that group welfare and cooperative norms are more important than short-run individual advantage. Their learning and adaptation are limited: they update little in response to heterogeneity in others’ outcomes, sticking to a consistent cooperative and rewarding profile throughout, with only moderate fluctuations in the amount they are willing to spend on rewards, not in the underlying strategy. Overall, they function as a steadfast high-cooperation, pro-reward type who prioritizes sustaining a cooperative climate over exploiting information about others’ payoffs.", "umap_x": 1.318094253540039, "umap_y": 0.7806523442268372, "cluster_id": 7, "cluster_size": 36, "cluster_title": "Reward / Contributions / High", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around reward, contributions, high, rewards, contribution."}

This suggests they accept the cooperative norm and are comfortable giving up the private endowment when they expect the group to do the same. Their contributions do not collapse over time; they repeatedly return to full contribution after deviations by others, so they do not display strong conditional cooperation in the sense of punishing defectors by systematically lowering their own contributions.\n\nAt a few points they contribute nothing despite high or near-unanimous contributions from others. These choices are infrequent and not followed by any explanation in chat, but they coincide with periods when overall cooperation is already strong and when the player is not being singled out in discussion. This pattern is consistent with occasional strategic free-riding: taking advantage of others’ contributions once a high-cooperation norm is established, while relying on the fact that no explicit sanction or tracking mechanism exists.\n\nThey do not verbally advocate for any contribution rule, do not try to enforce fairness norms, and do not publicly criticize low contributors. Their behavior suggests they internally value the higher payoffs from mutual cooperation but are also attentive to personal payoff maximization and willing to defect quietly when the social or reputational cost appears low. Risk tolerance appears moderate: they are willing to continue contributing even when some others defect, implying they are not highly loss-averse about “wasted” contributions, yet they also hedge with a few free-riding moves rather than naively contributing every time.\n\nOverall, their strategy is: “Contribute fully by default to preserve the cooperative environment and enjoy large group returns, but occasionally exploit the public good in a low-visibility way for extra personal gain,” without openly challenging or reinforcing norms in communication.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThis player’s communication is minimal, polite, and socially oriented rather than strategic.

They overwhelmingly choose to contribute fully to the public good even when others partially shirk, and they do not appear to condition their own contributions strongly on others’ deviations. The one deliberate zero contribution early on coincides with many others still giving; their own payoff then is strictly higher, so they do demonstrate understanding (or at least experience) that free-riding is lucrative. However, they immediately return to full contributions and maintain them for essentially the entire game, including in late rounds when group contributions wobble and when the marginal incentive to defect is especially strong. Their pattern suggests they prioritize maintaining group cooperation and stable earnings over exploiting occasional defection.\n\nTheir contributions are stable rather than volatile: apart from the single early zero and a period where others mistakenly perceive them as non-contributing despite them continuing to give, there is no oscillation between 0 and 20. They do not appear to retaliate against low contributors; they keep contributing even when specific others repeatedly give nothing, indicating a tolerance for inequity or a belief that maintaining the norm is more important than punishing defectors. They also do not appear to strategically time any end-game defection, instead continuing to cooperate when the game is close to ending (from the experimenter’s perspective), suggesting either limited strategic end-game calculation, an intrinsic cooperative preference, or a heuristic of “just keep contributing” once a norm is established.\n\nIncentive-wise, they seem motivated by a mix of money and social cohesion but lean towards sustaining cooperation: they join and support a high-contribution equilibrium and stick with it, likely recognizing that their own long-run earnings are better when the group stays cooperative. Their risk tolerance in the social sense is moderate: they are willing to risk being exploited by a few defectors to preserve the cooperative climate, rather than switching to pure self-protection. Fairness norms are present but not aggressively enforced; they do not initiate blame or pressure when others call them a “freeloader” in error and instead quietly keep cooperating, implying they value outcome fairness but are not driven to correct every misperception. Overall, their type is “loyal cooperator with mild early experimentation and low reactivity.”\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThey communicate sparingly compared to the more vocal players, and mostly in a light, affiliative tone rather than as a strategist or moralizer.

When given a binary choice between keeping everything or contributing everything, the player consistently chooses to contribute the maximum amount available in every observed round, regardless of how others behave.\n\nThey do not adjust their behavior downward in response to free-riding, intermittent non-contribution, or uncertainty about how long the game will last. Their pattern remains the same across high- and low-cooperation environments, including when multiple others contribute nothing, when full-group cooperation occurs, and when cooperation becomes more mixed again later. This indicates a strategy that is not reactive to short-term deviations or to individual defectors.\n\nThe player appears to adopt a simple heuristic: always contribute fully, because group contributions are multiplied and shared. They behave as if they accept the efficiency of full cooperation and commit to it, even though individual incentives to free-ride are present and visibly exploited by others. There is no evidence that they try to individually optimize against others’ choices; instead, they act as if they are playing a “social optimum” rule.\n\nThey show no apparent aversion strong enough to cause retaliation or withdrawal when others free-ride. Even in stretches where several peers fail to contribute, they maintain full contributions. This suggests that concerns about fairness are either weaker than their cooperative heuristic or are overridden by a desire to keep the public good high for the group.\n\nRisk tolerance appears high with respect to exploitation: they repeatedly expose themselves to the risk of earning less than non-cooperators while still contributing fully. They seem comfortable bearing the cost of contribution without guarantees that others will do the same, implying a pro-social or rule-following type who values consistent, cooperative play over guarding against being taken advantage of.\n\nThere is no visible learning curve: their behavior does not become more self-protective or more exploitative over time. The absence of strategic adaptation in response to repeated free-riding suggests they either do not prioritize dynamic payoff maximization or they are committed to a fixed, cooperative strategy regardless of others’ actions.\n\nOverall, their contribution profile fits a “persistent high cooperator / efficiency-oriented rule follower” type—someone who acts as though the correct move in this environment is always to contribute fully, and then sticks to that rule.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThe player does not send any chat messages throughout the entire interaction, even though chat is active and widely used by others. This places them in a “silent cooperator” role: highly engaged in contribution decisions but completely non-participatory in the communication channel.\n\nThey make no attempts to coordinate, persuade, shame defectors, or praise cooperators. They also do not respond to direct or indirect social prompts, general questions to the group, or the ongoing social banter. Their behavior indicates a strong separation between action and speech: they influence the game only via their contributions, not via talk.\n\nThe tone that can be inferred from silence plus consistent cooperation is one of low verbal engagement but high cooperative intent. They behave as if they believe that the best way to support group outcomes is simply to contribute, rather than to argue or negotiate about it. They do not exploit social cues (such as others’ emotional appeals or jokes) to adjust their play.\n\nTheir avoidance of chat suggests at least one of the following (all with low confidence, as motives are not observable): a preference for minimal social interaction, a task-focused mindset that treats the game as an individual decision problem, discomfort or disinterest in open group conversation, or a belief that communication is unnecessary for them to follow their chosen strategy.\n\nThey do show behavioral responsiveness in the sense that they continue to cooperate even when others discuss free-riding, experiment with not contributing, or complain about the game length. However, because their contributions are invariant, it is unclear whether they are actively processing chat content or simply ignoring it while following a fixed rule.\n\nIn new PGG environments, this type is best characterized as a quiet, reliably cooperative player: they consistently act in a strongly pro-social way but do not engage in explicit social influence, coalition-building, or expressive communication, and they are unlikely to use chat as a strategic tool.", "umap_x": -0.11021982133388519, "umap_y": 0.693352997303009, "cluster_id": 5, "cluster_size": 37, "cluster_title": "Reward / Cooperation / Contribution", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around reward, cooperation, contribution, free, contributions."}

They also sometimes contribute without any immediate pressure, suggesting that they accept the cooperative norm in principle and do not aim to purely maximize short‑term monetary payoff.\n\nAt the same time, they periodically free‑ride, especially in the middle and later parts of the game, even when cooperation is high. These zero‑contribution choices occur in situations where they can safely expect many others to contribute, indicating awareness of the material advantage of defection. They appear comfortable exploiting group cooperation intermittently rather than systematically; they do not consistently defect once cooperation is established, but rather “dip in and out” of free‑riding.\n\nTheir contribution pattern is thus volatile rather than monotonic: they oscillate between prosocial and selfish moves instead of showing a steady decay or unwavering cooperation. This suggests moderate risk tolerance and a willingness to experiment with both strategies, but without pushing the group into collapse.\n\nConditioning on others: they clearly pay attention to others’ behavior. When other players complain about non‑contributors or attempt to organize full contributions, this player tends to be on the contributing side, which indicates a responsiveness to social expectations and reputational concerns. However, this conditionality is imperfect: they still defect on some cooperative rounds, implying either limited self‑control, playful opportunism, or a lesser weight on fairness than on personal gain.\n\nThey show no explicit fairness enforcement: they neither shame low contributors nor lobby them directly. Their own intermittent defection suggests that they do not hold a strict “everyone must always give” fairness norm. Instead they seem comfortable with a “mostly cooperative, sometimes selfish” equilibrium, as long as the group continues to function.\n\nUnder uncertainty about the number of rounds, they do not visibly shift into an end‑game collapse pattern; their last decisions still mix cooperation and defection. This points to relatively weak backward‑induction reasoning or to a preference for maintaining the social game over perfectly timing exploitation.\n\nOverall, their strategy is: contribute often enough to sustain cooperation and social approval, but occasionally exploit high‑contribution environments to boost personal payoff, without openly challenging group norms.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nTone is light, playful, and affiliative.

This indicates attentiveness and a preference for mutual recognition within the group.\n\nThey occasionally signal alignment with the group’s cooperative mood indirectly, e.g., by affirming that they are “good now” after earlier behavior that might have drawn negative attention.

Their contribution pattern is stable rather than erratic: they do not react sharply to short-term deviations by others, and they continue to give fully across both high- and low-cooperation phases. The few times they contribute nothing, they still earn more than in their contribution rounds, so they are demonstrably aware—at least implicitly—of the material benefit of free-riding when others cooperate. Those non-contribution choices are rare and do not trigger a sustained shift to defection, suggesting they occasionally test or exploit the situation but do not reorient their entire strategy around payoff maximization. There is no visible evidence that their contributions are directly conditional on specific others’ behavior; they keep contributing even after observing multiple zero contributions from some group members, which points to either a strong pro-social norm, a long-term efficiency focus, or indifference to small fairness violations. They tolerate the risk that others may exploit them and do not appear to punish or retaliate via defection in any systematic way. Overall, they fit a “principled cooperator with mild opportunism”: their baseline is to cooperate, and deviations look more like sporadic opportunistic or exploratory moves than a deliberate conditional strategy.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThe player communicates sparingly and with low emotional intensity. They participate in the initial greetings, but do not attempt to lead or structure the group’s behavior through argument or instruction. Their one explicit stance on identity—openly labeling themselves as an AI when others assert they are not—suggests a dry, somewhat playful self-presentation and a willingness to stand apart from the group’s general tone. When they do speak about the game, they align themselves with cooperative norms in a minimal, supportive way (for example, very short affirmations of calls for full contribution) rather than making their own appeals or enforcing norms directly. They do not criticize defectors, do not call out individual players by name, and avoid moralizing or shaming. Their engagement style is low-key and reactive rather than proactive: they respond to themes initiated by others (like age, cooperation, or identity) but do not originate new discussion threads.

They know contributing nothing is individually profitable and use this often, but occasionally align with the group, especially when directly called out or when a cooperative norm seems solidified.\n\nTheir behavior alternates between free-riding and full cooperation rather than settling into a stable pattern. Early on they exploit a highly cooperative group by keeping their endowment while still receiving a large share of the public good. They then switch to substantial cooperation for stretches once strong pro-contribution norms and repeated full-contribution rounds emerge, but they intermittently revert to defection even when most others contribute fully.\n\nThey appear payoff-aware and somewhat skeptical about the eventual monetary reward, explicitly expressing doubt that the bonus will be large. This aligns with their frequent free-riding: they likely treat the game as low-stakes and are comfortable prioritizing own payoff over strict norm adherence.\n\nConditionality is present but weakly pro-social: they do sometimes contribute fully when the group is highly cooperative, and after being publicly noticed as a non-contributor they immediately switch to contributing. However, they do not maintain high contributions consistently even once universal contribution becomes common. Instead, they selectively defect in later periods despite ongoing high group contributions, indicating a willingness to exploit a cooperative environment once it feels secure.\n\nThey show some responsiveness to social pressure and reputational cues: when another player highlights their non-contribution in contrast to another target, they quickly adjust to contribute. Later, when another player publicly expresses disappointment directed at them, they do not immediately repair their reputation; by that point, they seem more comfortable deviating.\n\nRisk tolerance appears moderate. They are willing to “test” defection when many others are cooperating, banking on the group to continue contributing despite their free-riding. At the same time, they also invest in cooperative rounds that align with strong signals of group cohesion, which reduces strategic risk.\n\nTheir fairness norm is asymmetric: they readily enjoy benefits from others’ cooperation while contributing less themselves in multiple periods, yet they are not aggressively exploitative (they also contribute for significant stretches and join in celebrating “perfect” cooperative rounds). This suggests a “participate enough to be part of the group, but not enough to sacrifice too much” mentality.\n\nOverall, their strategy is an adaptive mix of: (a) early and intermittent free-riding to maximize personal payoff, (b) periods of full cooperation when normative pressure and group cohesion are salient, and (c) occasional late-game defection despite ongoing cooperation, indicating a persistent preference for personal gain over strict norm consistency.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThey present as sociable, playful, and lightly ironic, rather than purely instrumental. They greet the group early, join in the light-hearted tone, and use casual, informal phrasing that fits the social banter rather than focusing exclusively on payoff calculations. They occasionally use emotive symbols and brief affirmations, suggesting they care about being seen as part of the social fabric.\n\nThey do not take a leadership or coordination role. They never issue contribution instructions, propose explicit strategies, or explain payoff mechanics. Instead, they mostly react to others’ statements. When someone questions whether participants are AI, they join the identity play and affirm their own “human-ness,” but with slightly sloppy or humorous phrasing, implying a relaxed, not over-serious approach.\n\nThey once make an explicit comment about expected bonus size being low, revealing that they think critically about the incentive structure and are not overly optimistic about monetary reward. This may justify their willingness to defect: if the stakes feel small, free-riding feels more acceptable.\n\nThey lightly engage in social alignment and affiliative talk, both with playful symbols and short supportive comments (for example, cheering another player when that player finally contributes). This indicates they want to be liked and included, even as their contribution behavior is not fully cooperative.\n\nThey can be mildly critical, but in a soft, humorous way. When another player is labeled as stingy, they chime in that this player is “mean,” which is more teasing than confrontational. They do not directly accuse others of being selfish or demand higher contributions, even when free-riding is obvious.\n\nThey are responsive when addressed indirectly as responsible for non-contribution; once another participant points out their lack of giving, they change their behavior in the next action rather than defending themselves in chat. However, when a later message from a peer expresses disappointment directed at them specifically, they stay silent and do not publicly justify or apologize, suggesting limited concern for late-stage reputational repair.\n\nThey ask an information-seeking question about the number of rounds late in the game, and later comment on the potential length of the session. This shows situational awareness and some fatigue or concern about time investment. They attend to others’ answers and to shared uncertainty about game length.\n\nOverall, their communication style is: socially engaged but non-leading, humorous and light, strategically revealing (via one explicit comment about payoff expectations), and somewhat image-conscious but not enough to override their preference for opportunistic play.

They continue to give fully even when some others repeatedly contribute nothing and when total group contributions drop noticeably.  \n\nThey behave as if they accept (or do not question) the efficiency logic of the game: full contribution clearly yields high group payoffs, and they act in line with that throughout. There is no evidence of opportunistic free-riding, retaliation, or strategic withholding to discipline defectors.

Their contribution pattern is stable in its general direction (cooperative), but not perfectly rigid: they free-ride a small number of times despite strongly pro-contribution rhetoric. These deviations do not appear to be direct tit-for-tat responses to any single individual; instead they look like opportunistic tests or brief self-serving moves within an otherwise cooperative stance.\n\nThey show clear conditionality at the level of expectations and communication: they continually monitor which avatars under-contribute and call them out by name. However, this does not translate into systematic downward adjustment of their own contributions; even when others slack off, they mostly continue to give the maximum. This suggests a “moralized cooperator who occasionally cheats” rather than a strict conditional cooperator. Their fairness norm is strongly group-focused: they want everyone to contribute fully, criticize freeloading, and frame participation as a shared project to earn money. They tolerate imperfect fairness in practice, accepting that some will earn off their generosity but still maintaining high contributions.\n\nTheir risk tolerance appears moderate. They are willing to keep contributing fully even when some group members are inconsistent, which is risky in payoff terms, but they display moments of self-protective deviation (free-riding) that show they are not purely altruistic. They seem motivated by maximizing expected earnings given the strong multiplier and large group, but also by sustaining a cooperative climate that “feels right.” They do not appear to be experimenting systematically with different contribution strategies; changes are sparse and not clearly tied to detailed outcome reasoning, suggesting bounded but non-naive rationality.\n\nOverall type: a socially engaged, norm-enforcing high contributor, mostly cooperative but with occasional opportunistic free-riding and limited adjustment to others’ behavior.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThe player is highly talkative, socially playful, and actively engaged in coordination.

They repeatedly name individual players and tell them to contribute, sometimes using affectionate or joking framing to soften the pressure while still conveying clear expectations.\n\nThey demonstrate a strong inclination to coordinate and maintain group focus on earnings. They endorse the idea that the purpose of the interaction is to “make money” and urge anyone not aligned with that goal to leave, revealing instrumental motives beneath the playful surface. They quickly align with others who share the cooperative norm and use social approval (“you guys rock,” enthusiastic celebration of perfect rounds) to reinforce group-wide compliance. Positive behaviors (like a previously low-contributing player starting to contribute) are quickly met with warmth and inclusion; negative behaviors (non-contribution, perceived freeloading) are met with joking criticism and direct calls to change.\n\nThey respond actively to others’ messages, not just outcomes: they pick up on conversational threads (identity questions, jokes about animals, researchers, romance) and weave cooperation appeals into them. This shows high engagement and an integrative social style: they use relationship-building and banter as a vehicle for coordination rather than separating “strategy talk” from “social talk.” They exhibit a slightly manipulative but non-hostile persuasion style—mixing praise, teasing, conditional affection (“my love is fickle”) and moral framing to nudge behavior.\n\nTheir stance toward authority (the “researchers”) is lightly ironic but overall supportive; they endorse staying, getting comfy, and continuing to play despite fatigue, which stabilizes group participation.

After those early rounds, they shift into a broadly cooperative pattern: they usually choose the maximum contribution and maintain it for much of the game, even when a few others occasionally free-ride. This suggests they are willing to support a cooperative norm once it is clearly established and socially reinforced.\n\nTheir cooperation is not perfectly stable. They intermittently revert to contributing nothing despite high group contributions and active pro-cooperation norms. These non-contribution choices appear not to be direct retaliation against specific defectors; their free-riding occurs both when others defect and when others are largely cooperative. This points to a mix of motives: some payoff-seeking opportunism, some experimentation, and some playfulness rather than a strict conditional-cooperator rule.\n\nThey demonstrate awareness of others’ contributions and who is not contributing: they explicitly call out a non-contributor and later refer to “greedy” behavior by a specific player. However, this awareness does not translate into a clear tit-for-tat strategy. They often keep contributing fully even when they complain about other players’ failures to contribute. Their fairness norm appears to be: everyone should contribute, and free-riders are morally or socially blameworthy, but occasional self-serving deviation by themselves is acceptable.\n\nThey do not appear strongly risk-averse in the social sense. They are willing to contribute fully into a public account even after seeing several rounds where some group members do not contribute. At the same time, they exploit periods of strong cooperation by sometimes withholding contributions to capture higher individual payoffs. This pattern fits a “mostly cooperative opportunist”: they like the gains from cooperation and help sustain them, but they are comfortable bending the norm when it suits them and when detection bears no formal cost.\n\nMotivationally, they seem to care both about money and about the social experience. They talk about being hungry and wanting to be “contributed to,” making light of payoff issues rather than optimizing rigidly. They do not exhibit strong end-game unraveling based on known final rounds; when they free-ride late, they themselves acknowledge not fully reading instructions, suggesting limited attention to structure rather than a calculated endgame defection.\n\nOverall, their strategy is adaptive but loose: they move from initial exploitation of cooperators to a cooperative baseline, sprinkle in self-serving deviations, and keep following the emergent norm of “20 is what good players do” without rigidly enforcing it or adhering to it themselves.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThe player’s communication style is highly social, playful, and engaged, with light attempts at coordination but little technical or payoff-based persuasion.\n\nThey readily join the group’s banter, responding to greetings, sharing a (claimed) country, joking about age, food, and animals, and making humorous or slightly flirtatious comments. Their tone is informal and expressive, often leaning into character (e.g., as a “chick” or “baby chicken”) and using humor or self-descriptions (“sexy,” “hungry”) to stay central in the social conversation.\n\nThey do participate in coordination, but in a casual, non-authoritative way. They endorse the group’s full-contribution norm, explicitly encouraging everyone to choose the maximum and using inclusive language like “we” when talking about contributing. They later remind specific players to “contribute some coins” or ask if they are “asleep,” implicitly nudging them toward cooperation. Their arguments rely on social alignment (“let’s go,” “we go for 20”) and gentle teasing rather than explicit payoff calculations or moral lectures.\n\nThey also engage in mild social sanctioning through chat. When a player contributes nothing, they openly point this out and label that behavior negatively (e.g., calling someone “greedy”), but the tone stays playful rather than hostile. They seek and offer affection and approval, reacting to others’ expressions of love or support and joking about who loves whom. This suggests they value being liked and noticed by the group, and they use that social capital to reinforce the cooperative atmosphere more than to punish.\n\nResponsiveness is high: they reply to others’ questions (about origin, romance, food), build on earlier jokes, and adjust their comments when the group reacts (e.g., doubling down on playful identity banter when others engage). They acknowledge their own inattentiveness to instructions casually, which fits an easygoing, socially oriented focus rather than a strongly task- or rule-focused mindset.\n\nOverall, they are an engaged, sociable participant who helps maintain group cohesion and the cooperative mood through humor and light nudging, rather than a formal leader or strict enforcer.", "umap_x": -0.5197842717170715, "umap_y": 2.1171395778656006, "cluster_id": 3, "cluster_size": 29, "cluster_title": "Group / Contribution / Cooperative", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around group, contribution, cooperative, cooperation, contributions."}

Early on, they alternate between contributing nothing and contributing fully, rather than settling immediately into a stable pattern. As the game progresses and high group contributions become common, they increasingly default to contributing the full amount and rarely defect later on. Their behavior indicates they understand the payoff structure at least roughly: they directly discuss the approximate money-per-coins conversion and make comments that show attention to total group earnings. They are not a pure payoff maximizer, because in several instances they contribute fully even when others are partially defecting and when free-riding would clearly earn them more in that moment. However, they are also not a strict altruist; they sometimes choose zero while others mostly contribute, indicating some willingness to exploit the public good.\n\nTheir cooperation appears conditional on both perceived group norms and their own engagement. When the group is cohesive and chatty and most are contributing, they join in and push for everyone to cooperate. When they are distracted (mentioning needing to cook) or when they see room to gain at low personal social cost, they free-ride. Over time, once a norm of near-universal contribution is established, they largely adhere to it and even cheer “perfect” rounds, suggesting that group efficiency and shared success matter to them.\n\nRisk tolerance around cooperation is moderate. They are willing to contribute even when a few known defectors or AFK players exist, as long as most of the group is cooperative. They do not appear to play a “grim trigger” strategy; they keep contributing despite some persistent low contributors, rather than withdrawing entirely. Their notion of fairness seems loosely defined: they enjoy high-earnings outcomes and encourage everyone to contribute, but they do not personally enforce fairness by consistently matching others’ behavior, nor do they always sacrifice to offset defectors. Instead, they oscillate between self-interested and group-oriented decisions, suggesting a pragmatic, flexible form of conditional cooperation rather than a principled fairness ethic.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThe player’s tone is playful, sarcastic, and socially engaged. They participate actively in chat from the start, using humor, exaggerated greetings, and identity play. They self-label in joking, provocative ways and riff on others’ comments, showing comfort with banter and a desire to entertain or stand out. Their messages are short and informal, with frequent use of all caps, elongated words, and simple text emoticons, indicating a casual, expressive style rather than a careful or restrained one.\n\nThey do at times attempt coordination and persuasion, notably when urging everyone to contribute and when commenting on the money-per-coins relationship to motivate participation. However, they are not a central organizer: they contribute a few pieces of payoff-relevant information and one clear group-directed exhortation, but mostly follow or amplify the more overtly coordinating players rather than leading systematic strategy discussions. Their persuasion is more cheerleading and joking than analytical.\n\nResponsiveness to others is high. They react to multiple threads—discussions about being AI or not, countries, ages, researchers, and specific players like Monkey and Gorilla being AFK. They quickly adopt group jargon (e.g., AFK) and explain it humorously rather than literally. They comment on who is present or absent and engage with other players’ concerns (like number of rounds or total bonus), signaling that they track the social environment closely. When others complain about non-contributors, they join in lightly (e.g., speculating someone is away) rather than shaming or confronting them aggressively.\n\nTheir engagement style is participatory and socially oriented: they stay active in chat throughout, rarely going quiet for long stretches. They mix game-relevant comments (earnings, rounds, encouraging contributions) with off-topic or meta commentary (about researchers, duration of the session, their own schedule). This suggests they value the social experience and playfulness of the game, not just the monetary outcome. At the same time, their jokes sometimes intentionally mislead or exaggerate (e.g., about number of rounds, acronyms), which indicates a willingness to sacrifice strict informational accuracy for humor.

They tolerate some personal cost to help maintain a cooperative equilibrium, but they do not adhere to a rigid fairness rule such as “I must always contribute when others do.” Their risk tolerance is moderate: they are willing to stay cooperative even when a few free-riders are present, suggesting they are not overly anxious about being exploited, but they also take some “low-risk” free-riding opportunities when the group is clearly cooperative and the public good returns are high.\n\nOverall, their contribution profile is: generally high, reasonably stable, only weakly contingent on recent group behavior, but punctuated by a small number of self-serving deviations that show they balance social efficiency with personal gain.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThis player communicates in a light, sociable, and slightly ironic tone, engaging with the group more as a participant in a chatroom than as a hard-nosed strategist. They initiate normal greetings, share a bit of personal context (location, time of day, dinner status), and make playful or teasing remarks (e.g., joking about age, romance, and the “angry bird” avatar). Their comments show that they pay attention to the social atmosphere and enjoy the banter.\n\nThey rarely use chat to coordinate explicit contribution strategies or to pressure others about contributions. They leave demands and exhortations (“everyone contribute”, “we all win”) to more vocal players and do not lead norm-setting around cooperation. When they do address behavior, it is indirect and humorous rather than moralizing; for example, when lightly accused or stereotyped, they respond with tongue‑in‑cheek banter instead of defensiveness. When another player criticizes the researchers, they distance themselves and openly state that they care about the money, but they frame this in a humorous, non-confrontational way, aligning with the experiment while keeping the tone playful.\n\nThey also show responsiveness: they answer questions about being human, join in the conversation about region and dinner, and echo or riff on others’ comments (including clarifying what an avatar looks like and speculating about the study length). This indicates attentive engagement and a preference for inclusion over isolation.\n\nThey avoid conflict escalation; even when teased or half-insulted, they respond with mild sarcasm rather than aggression. They do not shame defectors or call out specific players’ contributions. Their communication style is affiliative and slightly self-deprecating, suggesting a social persona who wants to be liked, keep the interaction fun, and maintain group cohesion more than to maximize their own payoff at all costs or enforce strict norms through chat.", "umap_x": -0.5166705846786499, "umap_y": 1.9042445421218872, "cluster_id": 3, "cluster_size": 29, "cluster_title": "Group / Contribution / Cooperative", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around group, contribution, cooperative, cooperation, contributions."}

They understand that contributing maximally is socially expected and can yield group gains, but they prioritize their own payoff whenever they see room to exploit strong cooperation from others.\n\nTheir contribution pattern is mixed but not random: they alternate between full contribution and full defection, never choosing intermediate amounts (only the two available extremes). They contribute fully in some stretches when group norms of cooperation are salient and when they are under social attention, then revert to consistent non-contribution once the environment feels safe for them to free-ride. They are capable of sustained cooperation for several consecutive decisions, but this collapses when they anticipate that others will continue contributing regardless of their own behavior.\n\nThey show clear conditionality: they urge others to “not be tight” and give the maximum when cooperation levels have dipped, framing contribution as the right thing to do. Yet they themselves defect in multiple instances immediately after or around such messaging, especially when others are mostly cooperative and when they can personally profit from the public good funded by others. This reflects a “public moralist, private opportunist” style: they endorse high contributions as a norm but do not reliably adhere to it when there is no direct sanction.\n\nThe player’s sense of fairness is asymmetric. They want others to be generous, describe under-contributors (implicitly) as “tight,” and express no guilt or apology when called out for giving nothing. They do not defend or justify their low contributions when named by others, suggesting they are either comfortable with the resulting mild disapproval or find that the social cost is low enough to ignore.\n\nRisk tolerance appears moderate. They are willing to be one of a small subset defecting in an otherwise cooperative group, which risks social criticism but promises higher payoffs. At the same time, they periodically return to full contribution, which can be read either as a response to social pressure, a desire to avoid standing out as purely selfish, or mild concern that persistent defection might harm future group cooperation and hence their own long-run payoffs. Across the later stages, once strong cooperative norms and high total contributions are established, they increasingly choose non-contribution, indicating that when they believe others’ cooperation is stable, they see little downside in free-riding.\n\nOverall, their strategy is flexible exploitation: cooperate enough to be included and occasionally praised, but defect whenever the group environment appears cooperative and forgiving.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThe player’s communication is playful, teasing, and attention-seeking, with a light, humorous tone. They engage actively in the chat, responding to the social atmosphere rather than driving detailed strategic coordination. They adopt a persona-focused style (“monkey” identity, bodily needs jokes, mock-flirtation), which makes them socially salient without committing them strongly to any cooperative contract.\n\nThey do attempt basic coordination: they explicitly urge others to contribute the maximum and frame withholding as being “tight,” appealing to social norms rather than precise payoff calculations. They also at one point jokingly suggest that others “should all contribute to” them, making the selfish intent explicit in a humorous way. This indicates that they understand the structure of the game and how others’ contributions benefit them, and they are comfortable rhetorically nudging others toward behavior that advantages them.\n\nTheir persuasion tactics are informal, relying on banter and status-play rather than argument or data. They do not supply payoff math or long-run reasoning; instead, they invoke identity and affect (e.g., shame around tightness, playful self-labeling as a “king” of complainers) to influence group norms. They appear unconcerned about being labeled “greedy” or “mean,” and they respond to such labels with humor or silence rather than contrition, showing low sensitivity to mild social sanction.\n\nResponsiveness is selective. Early on, they explicitly respond to the ongoing social conversation, including location talk and flirtatious comments. When their defection is noted by others, they occasionally acknowledge the group (for example, with an emotive reaction when targeted by attack/joke), but they do not offer substantive justification or change in response to a single complaint. Later, when others speculate that they are absent, they remain silent for a time, which may be actual distraction or strategic non-engagement; once they resume speaking, they are friendly and emotionally expressive, quickly reintegrating into the social flow.\n\nTheir overall engagement style is socially playful, irreverent, and non-confrontational. They prefer to maintain a lighthearted, likable persona while quietly implementing an individually advantageous contribution strategy. They are willing to encourage group cooperation in words, but their actual behavior reveals that they see the chat primarily as a social space and a tool for maintaining acceptance, not as a binding commitment to fair contribution.", "umap_x": -0.23967120051383972, "umap_y": 1.7709871530532837, "cluster_id": 3, "cluster_size": 29, "cluster_title": "Group / Contribution / Cooperative", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around group, contribution, cooperative, cooperation, contributions."}

They always choose the maximum contribution available and never deviate, regardless of others’ behavior, chat dynamics, or apparent fatigue over time. Their strategy does not appear reactive or contingent on specific individuals’ choices; they continue to cooperate even when some group members repeatedly free-ride or go inactive.\n\nThey align strongly with a fairness/efficiency norm that everyone should contribute fully so that the group benefits. They explicitly endorse group-wide cooperation and show no sign of experimenting with defection to test payoffs or punish others. This suggests a preference for maintaining a clear, simple rule (“everyone contributes”) over strategically tailoring behavior to short-term incentives.\n\nTheir risk tolerance around being exploited by free riders is high: they continue to contribute fully despite visible non-contributors and variable group performance. They accept short-term vulnerability to exploitation in order to sustain the cooperative norm and group earnings. There is no evidence that their contributions are influenced by end-game considerations; they maintain the same behavior through the final rounds, indicating either a strong internal rule-following motive, a pro-social/value-driven motive, or both, rather than narrow payoff maximization in the short run.\n\nOverall, they fit a “pro-social, rule-following cooperator” type: they reliably provide the public good, are tolerance of some unfairness, and push for universal cooperation rhetorically but do not back this with strategic defection.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nTheir tone is consistently warm, light, and affiliative. They greet others, share minimal personal information when prompted (such as general location), and participate in casual banter. They use humor and friendly markers (including a heart symbol) to signal positive affect and group solidarity. They do not confront or shame low contributors; instead, their only explicit normative statement about the game is a positive appeal that everyone should contribute, framed inclusively and without targeting any specific person.\n\nThey show moderate engagement: they are not a dominant voice in the chat but join in occasionally, responding to ongoing topics (identity, origins, jokes, researchers) rather than initiating new strategic discussions. When others discuss cooperation norms or comment on the experimenters, they align themselves socially with the cooperative, appreciative camp rather than the more cynical voices.\n\nTheir communication style is prosocial and cohesion-oriented rather than instrumental. They do not attempt to micro-coordinate contributions or threaten any form of social sanction; instead, they reinforce group spirit, encourage cooperation in a friendly way, and express appreciation toward researchers when others criticize them. They are responsive to the social atmosphere, mirroring the playful mood and supportive comments rather than steering interactions toward hard-nosed payoff optimization.\n\nIn interpersonal terms, they present as agreeable, non-confrontational, and mildly humorous.

They begin by giving substantially more than the group average, indicating a strong cooperative inclination and a willingness to sacrifice private payoff for group benefit despite the relatively low marginal per-capita return. They then reduce their contribution while still remaining close to or slightly below the evolving group norm, suggesting conditional cooperation rather than unconditional altruism. Their behavior reflects sensitivity to fairness: they appear comfortable contributing more than some others but not committed to always matching the highest contributors, and they do not chase status as a top contributor when it is personally costly. Risk tolerance appears moderate: they are willing to test high cooperation in an initially unfamiliar environment but subsequently hedge by retaining more for themselves once they see how others behave and what payoffs result. Overall, they fit a “prosocial conditional cooperator” type who starts generous and then calibrates toward a more self-protective but still cooperative stance.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThis player does not use costly punishment at all, even when there are clearly identifiable low contributors. They refrain from sanctioning those who contribute substantially less than the group, despite having the ability to impose cost-effective deductions and knowing that punishers are identifiable. This suggests a strong reluctance to engage in negative sanctions, consistent with conflict-avoidant or normatively “non-punitive” preferences. There is no evidence of either deterrence-driven punishment (to shape future behavior) or retaliation-based punishment (since they are never targeted themselves). Given the availability and efficiency of the punishment technology, their zero use of it indicates either a principled aversion to harming others, a belief that punishment is not necessary in a mostly cooperative group, or a preference to let others carry any sanctioning burden. The exact motive is unknown, but their pattern is best characterized as “non-punisher by default,” even in the presence of free-riding.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nThis is unknown, as the player is never punished. There is no behavioral evidence on whether they would respond with forgiveness, compliance, or retaliation when sanctioners are identifiable.\n\n<REWARD>\nThis player is willing to incur a small cost to reward a very low contributor who ends up with a high payoff. The reward is minimal and singular, suggesting that they are exploratory or selective rather than strongly committed to a broad rewarding strategy. Because the recipient is one of the lowest contributors, the reward is unlikely to be a straightforward “reward high cooperators” signal. Possible interpretations (all low confidence) include: attempting to encourage a low contributor to increase future cooperation; responding positively to the recipient’s overall outcome (e.g., high payoff) rather than to their contribution; or testing the institution of reward to see how it works in practice. They do not repeat reward behavior later, even when others engage in rewarding, which suggests they do not adopt reward as a central strategic tool for norm enforcement or alliance-building. In summary, they are capable of positive reinforcement but apply it sparingly and in a somewhat unconventional direction, with the underlying rationale uncertain.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThis is unknown, as the player is never rewarded. There is no evidence on whether they would reciprocate materially, shift contributions, or treat rewarders differently in future interactions.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThe player observes a generally cooperative environment with only a few relatively low contributors, plus visible instances of both punishment and reward by others. Their subsequent behavior—lowering their own contribution slightly, abandoning reward, and continuing to avoid punishment—indicates that they adjust primarily based on their own contribution–payoff trade-off rather than reacting strongly to others’ sanctioning choices. They do not mimic the punitive behavior directed at a low contributor, nor do they join the emergent use of reward by others, suggesting independence from social pressure to enforce norms. At the same time, they do not dramatically defect in response to mild free-riding, implying that modest deviations from fairness do not trigger a breakdown of their cooperation. Overall, they appear observant but behaviorally restrained: they update their own contribution level in a self-regarding yet still cooperative direction, while staying disengaged from the emerging punishment–reward dynamics and not visibly responding to others’ costs, deductions, or grants.", "umap_x": 1.1922430992126465, "umap_y": -1.0292550325393677, "cluster_id": 6, "cluster_size": 31, "cluster_title": "Punishment / Reward / Contribution", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around punishment, reward, contribution, contributions, low."}

They consistently allocate their full endowment to the public fund, even when others contribute less on average and even when some group members clearly free-ride or under-contribute. There is no evidence that they condition their behavior on others’ past contributions, or that they adjust toward the group average; instead, they maintain a maximal cooperative stance. This suggests a strong internal norm of full cooperation or efficiency-seeking, with low concern for immediate relative payoff and low sensitivity to exploitation risk. They appear willing to accept being among the highest contributors and do not show signs of strategic hedging or risk-averse contribution behavior. Their fairness concept, if any, is not enforced via adjusting contributions downward; they tolerate inequality in contributions while continuing to cooperate. Whether they understand the payoff structure in detail is unknown, but their repeated full contributions indicate either a principled or simple “always contribute everything” rule.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey show zero willingness to use costly punishment, despite clear opportunities and identifiable targets ranging from low to very low contributors. They refrain from punishing even when some players contribute notably less than the group norm, and they also refrain from punishing any participant who spends on punishment or reward. This indicates a non-punitive strategy: they do not invest in deterrence, norm-enforcement, or retaliation. They appear to prioritize preserving their own payoff over imposing costs on norm violators, or they may reject the role of enforcer altogether. There is no evidence of selective or conditional punishment; their pattern is simply to abstain. Their motives could include dislike of harming others, skepticism about the effectiveness of punishment, or a focus on their own cooperative behavior rather than on policing others, but the precise motive is unknown.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nThey are never punished in this transcript, so their direct response to being sanctioned is unknown. Since punishers are identifiable but they do not experience any deductions, there is no behavioral evidence of forgiveness, compliance, or retaliation. They also do not punish anyone who punished others, suggesting they do not react to punishment behavior in third-party fashion either. Any inferences about how they would respond if personally punished would be speculative; thus their tolerance for sanctions, propensity toward retaliatory punishment, or willingness to adjust contributions in response to being targeted remain unknown.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey consistently avoid using the reward mechanism, even though it is available, identifiable, and used by others. They do not reward high contributors, co-contributors who also give the maximum, or players who reward them. This indicates that they do not engage in strategic reinforcement of cooperative behavior via material rewards. Their stance appears to be non-interventionist: they contribute a lot themselves but refrain from actively shaping others’ incentives through rewards. Whether this reflects indifference to others’ prosocial actions, a desire to conserve their own payoff, or a belief that rewards are unnecessary or inefficient is unknown. There is no sign of targeted or group-level rewarding; the reward channel remains unused.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThey do receive a reward from another player but do not reciprocate materially. Despite the rewarder being identifiable and the mechanism allowing them to respond, they choose not to send reward back or to reward similar cooperators. This suggests that they do not practice direct reciprocity in the form of costly rewarding. They neither escalate into a mutual-reward “alliance” nor show gratitude through the available mechanism. This could indicate that they separate their own cooperative decision (contribution) from the auxiliary reward system, treating the latter as non-essential, or that they prioritize maximizing their own payoff over symbolic or reciprocal gestures. Their emotional response (gratitude, indifference, etc.) is unknown; behaviorally, they remain unresponsive in material terms.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey observe others’ contributions, payoff outcomes, and uses of punishment and reward, yet their own behavior remains unchanged and highly cooperative. The presence of clear under-contributors does not lead them to reduce their contributions or to sanction those players. The existence of punishers and rewarders does not prompt them to join in, imitate, or counteract those patterns. They appear behaviorally robust: others’ payoffs and sanctioning choices do not visibly influence their cooperative or enforcement strategies. This suggests a type who focuses primarily on their own chosen rule—full contribution, no sanctions—rather than adapting to others’ profit levels or norm-enforcement actions. Their beliefs about whether others “deserve” their outcomes, whether the system is fair, or whether sanctions are effective are unknown; what is observable is a stable, non-reactive, high-cooperation, no-enforcement profile.", "umap_x": 1.1700586080551147, "umap_y": -0.8734235763549805, "cluster_id": 6, "cluster_size": 31, "cluster_title": "Punishment / Reward / Contribution", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around punishment, reward, contribution, contributions, low."}

Their behavior suggests a fairness or “do my part” norm: they neither exploit others’ generosity nor sacrifice to the extreme. There is no observable conditional adjustment to others’ behavior; they keep the same contribution level despite variation in others’ contributions and in the pattern of punishment and reward around them. This points to a simple, rule-like strategy (e.g., a fixed notion of a “fair” contribution) rather than fine-grained conditional cooperation. They tolerate some inequality and apparent free-riding by low contributors, indicating either low sensitivity to exploitation, a focus on own stable rule, or a belief that the environment is too short/uncertain to justify complex adaptation. Risk attitude toward the public good is moderate: they give enough to benefit from the multiplier but retain a substantial private portion.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey never use punishment, even when low contributors and some norm-enforcement behavior by others are apparent. This strongly suggests either a principled reluctance to pay for sanctions, a preference to avoid confrontation, or a belief that punishment is not worth the cost in such a short or uncertain setting. There is no evidence of targeted or selective punishment; their default is non-punitive. They do not participate in norm enforcement against lower contributors, and they do not retaliate against anyone (unknown whether they would if ever punished). Their likely motive structure around punishment leans towards cost–benefit skepticism and/or a non-aggressive social preference: they allow others to bear the costs of enforcing norms, while personally focusing on contribution and own payoff. Deterrence, reciprocity in punishment, and retaliatory motives remain unknown due to lack of triggering events.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nThey are never punished, so direct responses cannot be inferred. It is unknown how they respond emotionally or strategically to being sanctioned, whether they would increase contributions in compliance, retaliate, or simply ignore. Given their already cooperative contributions and non-punishing stance, a cautious extrapolation is that they might interpret punishment as either mistaken or unfair and still avoid counter-punishment, but this is low confidence and not behaviorally confirmed.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey never use rewards despite having several clear opportunities to positively reinforce high contributors. This indicates a reluctance to incur costs even for prosocial reinforcement, and/or a belief that direct contribution is the primary channel through which they wish to express cooperation. They do not appear to engage in alliance-building or gratitude-signaling via rewards, even in the presence of clearly cooperative others. Strategically, they seem to separate their own contribution choice from secondary mechanisms; they cooperate through giving, not through meta-level incentives. Whether they conceptually approve of rewards but find them too costly, or are indifferent to shaping others’ behavior via incentives, is unknown; the observed pattern is simply non-use.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThey are never rewarded, so responses cannot be directly observed. It is unknown whether they would reciprocate rewards, adjust contributions upward, or direct rewards back to benefactors in future rounds. Given their lack of reward use even when others are generous, it is uncertain that they would adopt a reciprocal rewarding strategy in response to being rewarded.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey observe substantial information about others’ contributions, payoffs, and uses of punishment and reward, yet do not alter their own contribution level or begin to engage in sanctions or rewards. This suggests a relatively low reactivity to social signals and payoff patterns in the short run. They do not appear to punish conspicuous low contributors, nor reward consistent high contributors, despite seeing them and knowing who engages in enforcement or generosity. They also do not mimic others’ enforcement or reward behavior. Their type is best described as a steady, moderately prosocial cooperator who focuses on their own rule for contribution and treats observed variations in others’ outcomes, punishments, and rewards as background noise rather than strategic input.

They start by giving somewhat less than the emerging group norm, then increase to the cooperative maximum once they observe that many others are also contributing at or near that level. Their behavior is conditionally cooperative rather than purely altruistic: they appear willing to contribute generously when others do the same, and do not exploit the group even when they could gain more by free-riding. They tolerate some variation in others’ contributions, since they continue to give fully even when a few group members contribute noticeably less. They seem willing to accept personal payoff losses relative to low contributors in order to support the public fund, suggesting that short-term payoff maximization is not their only concern. Their risk tolerance with respect to cooperation is moderate: they adjust upward in response to evidence of general cooperativeness, but there is insufficient data to know how they behave in an initially uncooperative or deteriorating group (unknown).\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey never use punishment, despite clear opportunities and despite at least one identifiable low contributor and evidence that others are willing to punish. This indicates a strong reluctance to incur costs to harm others, even when those others contribute less than the emerging norm. Their lack of punishment appears stable across experiences of both being relatively under-contributing and then fully contributing. This suggests they are not motivated by retaliation or by norm-enforcement through sanctions. They do not engage in targeted punishment of clear low contributors, implying either a preference to avoid conflict, a belief that punishment is inefficient or unjustified, or indifference to sanctioning norms (exact motive unknown). Overall, they function as a non-punishing cooperator: they contribute substantially but refrain from using costly negative sanctions as a tool for shaping others’ behavior.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nThey are never punished in the observed interactions, so their behavioral response to being punished is unknown. There is no evidence of anticipatory fear of punishment driving their cooperation: they initially contribute less than many others while remaining unpunished, and later increase their contribution without having been sanctioned. Their attitude toward identifiable punishers in the group cannot be inferred beyond the fact that they do not imitate that behavior and do not join in punishing alongside them.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey consistently abstain from rewarding, even when they clearly observe several others making high or maximal contributions and see that some group members are willing to expend resources on rewards. This points to a pattern of not using positive incentives either, despite personally matching or exceeding the efforts of highly cooperative peers later on. Possible reasons include a desire to conserve resources, a belief that rewarding is unnecessary given already high cooperation, or a general preference to avoid intervention in others’ payoffs (specific motive unknown). Their stance is internally consistent: they cooperate themselves but do not pay to shape or acknowledge others’ behavior through formal rewards.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThey are never rewarded, so direct reciprocity toward a known rewarder cannot be observed. Consequently, their willingness to return favors, form implicit alliances with rewarders, or increase cooperation after being rewarded remains unknown. There is also no evidence that the mere presence of reward activity by others changes their own use of reward or punishment.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey observe that others differ in contributions and in their willingness to spend on punishment and reward, including some low contributors and some active sanctioners and rewarders. Despite this, they maintain a non-interventionist stance: they do not join in punishing those who are sanctioned, do not copy those who reward, and do not appear to strategically align with any subgroup. Their own contribution becomes more cooperative after seeing generally high group contributions, indicating sensitivity to the overall level of cooperation rather than to specific individual outcomes. They do not respond to others’ payoffs or sanctioning choices with counter-sanctions, supportive rewards, or visible strategic adjustments beyond their own contribution level.

They contribute their entire endowment each time, without adjusting to the fact that others, on average, contribute less. They show no evidence of conditional cooperation or reciprocity; their contribution does not respond to variation in others’ contributions across periods. They act as if maximizing group welfare or adhering to an internal fairness/efficiency norm, despite the low marginal per capita return that makes full contribution individually costly. They tolerate being among the highest contributors without withdrawing, suggesting low sensitivity to relative disadvantage and a willingness to risk being exploited for the sake of maintaining a cooperative standard. Whether this reflects principled altruism, experiment-naïveté, or a fixed heuristic is unknown, but their behavior is consistent with a “set-and-forget” cooperative rule rather than a responsive strategy.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThe player is willing to use costly punishment and targets a single, relatively low contributor. They do not punish multiple low contributors, indicating selectivity rather than indiscriminate sanctioning. The choice to punish is consistent with enforcing a cooperative or fairness norm: a below-average contributor is made worse off at real cost to the punisher. There is no observable retaliation motive, since the target has not harmed them individually beyond under-contributing to the public good. The sanction size is nontrivial but not maximal, suggesting calibrated disapproval rather than extreme spite. Afterward, the player does not escalate or repeat punishment, even when other low or moderate contributions occur later, which could indicate that they are testing whether a single punishment suffices as a deterrent, or that their inclination to punish is situational and limited rather than a stable, heavy-punishment style. Longer-term consistency of this pattern is unknown.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nThe player is never punished in the observed interaction. Their responses to being sanctioned, including whether they would reduce contributions, retaliate, or comply with perceived norms, are unknown.\n\n<REWARD>\nThe player refrains from rewarding entirely, despite the presence of several high contributors. This suggests a clear asymmetry: they are willing to bear costs to punish norm violators but not to reward norm followers. They do not appear to use rewards strategically to encourage high contribution, build alliances, or express gratitude. Their cooperative enforcement is thus “stick-only” rather than “carrot-and-stick.” It is unclear whether they perceive rewards as inefficient, unnecessary, or simply overlook them; what is evident is that they prioritize negative sanctioning over positive reinforcement when trying to shape others’ behavior.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThe player receives no rewards. Their propensity for reciprocating rewards, forming cooperative partnerships with generous peers, or shifting subsequent contributions in response to being rewarded is unknown.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThe player observes that others often contribute less yet still earn competitive or even higher payoffs, and that some peers spend on both punishment and reward. They do not adjust their own contributions downward in response to free-riding, nor upward in reaction to others’ generosity; they hold a stable cooperative level regardless of payoff comparisons. This indicates low reactivity to relative payoffs and to others’ sanctioning behavior. Their single punitive act shows they attend to who is deviating from a contribution norm, but they do not then engage in broader pattern-based punishment or emulation of others’ use of rewards.

They later reduce their contribution while still staying within the broad cooperative band of the group, suggesting conditional cooperation rather than unconditional altruism. Their pattern implies attention to others’ contributions and a desire not to be either a sucker (far above others) or an exploiter (far below others). They appear sensitive to efficiency: the multiplication of the public fund is understood, but they balance it against private payoff, indicating moderate risk tolerance and a pragmatic, payoff-conscious approach rather than purely norm-driven behavior.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey make no use of punishment despite observing that punishment is active in the environment and can be targeted at identifiable individuals. Even when clear low contributors exist and some players are punished or engage in costly sanctioning, they refrain from participating. This suggests either a reluctance to spend resources on norm enforcement, a preference to avoid conflict, or skepticism about the cost-effectiveness of punishment in such a short interaction. There is no evidence of retaliatory tendencies or of using punishment strategically for deterrence. Overall, they behave as a non-punisher: they tolerate contribution heterogeneity and do not attempt to discipline others.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nThey are never punished, so their direct response to being sanctioned is unknown. Because they never punish anyone themselves, there is no observed retaliation dynamic. Their stable non-use of punishment, even after seeing others punish, weakly suggests they are unlikely to respond to hypothetical punishment with counter-punishment, but this is low confidence. Their propensity to adjust contributions rather than to sanction others suggests that, if punished, they might be more inclined to update behavior than to escalate, but again this is speculative and should be treated as unknown in strict terms.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey never reward any other player, despite witnessing that some players do invest in rewards. This consistent non-use suggests they prioritize conserving personal payoff over reinforcing others’ cooperation through positive incentives. They do not selectively reward high contributors, nor do they use reward to signal alliances or gratitude. This can reflect a view that contributions should stand on their own without extra transfers, or a belief that the short horizon makes such investments strategically unattractive. In terms of type, they are a non-rewarder who relies purely on contribution decisions rather than second-stage prosocial transfers.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThey receive no rewards, so their direct behavioral response to being rewarded is unknown. There is no evidence of reciprocal reward or of forming implicit cooperative “clubs” through mutual bonuses. Given their general avoidance of both punishment and reward despite seeing others spend in these ways, it is uncertain whether they would reciprocate if rewarded; any assumption about gratitude signaling or alliance-building from them would be speculative. Mark this dimension as unknown.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey appear attentive to others’ contributions and final payoffs, as their own contribution changes in a direction consistent with reacting to the observed cooperative environment and payoff structure. However, they choose not to intervene via punishment or reward even when others incur nontrivial costs doing so. This suggests a largely observational stance toward others’ outcomes: they use the information mainly to calibrate their own contribution rather than to manage others’ behavior. They neither support punishers nor protect punished players, and they do not reinforce those who give or receive rewards. Overall, they behave as a quietly adaptive, self-focused conditional cooperator: they watch what others do, adjust their own giving accordingly, but refrain from engaging in costly social control or social bonding through rewards.", "umap_x": 1.4763240814208984, "umap_y": -0.9292323589324951, "cluster_id": 6, "cluster_size": 31, "cluster_title": "Punishment / Reward / Contribution", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around punishment, reward, contribution, contributions, low."}

Their initial contribution level is clearly cooperative and above what a purely self-interested, non-cooperative type would give, but it is not at the very top of the group. After observing that several peers contribute the maximum and that the group as a whole is highly cooperative, they reduce their own contribution rather than matching or increasing it. This pattern suggests conditional cooperation with a self-serving bias: they are willing to support the public good but are comfortable free-riding at the margin when they see others sustaining high contributions. They appear sensitive to relative standing—when they are slightly below the group’s contribution elite, they do not try to “keep up,” indicating weaker fairness or equality norms compared to strong altruists. Their behavior is consistent with someone who values payoff optimization within a cooperative environment more than strict contribution fairness. Risk tolerance is unknown beyond a mild willingness to deviate downward from the emerging high-cooperation norm.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey do not use punishment at all, despite having clear information about others’ contributions and visible examples of others spending on punishment. This indicates a low willingness to incur personal cost to sanction behavior, even when some players contribute much less than the group. Whether they interpret low contributors as deserving punishment or simply do not see the point of costly sanctions is unknown, but their revealed preference is to avoid entering punitive dynamics altogether. They neither engage in norm enforcement nor appear to seek deterrence. There is no evidence of retaliatory motives; if they feel wronged or exploited by lower contributors, they do not act on it through the punishment channel.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nThey are never punished in the observed interaction, so direct response is unknown. There is no evidence of anticipatory fear of punishment shaping their contributions, since they are willing to reduce their contribution after seeing that sanctions exist in the environment. This suggests that, at least in this context, they do not strongly adjust behavior in a precautionary way to avoid potential punishers. Their tendencies toward forgiveness, compliance, or retaliation when personally targeted remain unknown.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey do not reward anyone, even though many peers contribute highly and some players actively use rewards. This indicates a low propensity to spend resources to positively reinforce cooperative behavior. Reward abstention occurs both when there are clearly high contributors and when other players are observed using rewards, so their inaction is not due to a lack of candidates or lack of awareness of the mechanism. This is compatible with a payoff-focused style: they rely on others’ intrinsic or social motivations to sustain cooperation but do not personally invest in building or reinforcing those norms. Whether they conceptually approve of rewarding or simply find it inefficient is unknown; what is clear is that they do not trade off own payoff to benefit others via rewards.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThey are never rewarded, so their direct reaction is unknown. They observe some players spending on rewards, but this does not lead them to join in or reciprocate the rewarding behavior. There is no sign that the presence of rewarders encourages them to form alliances or to behave more generously. Their reciprocity toward positive actions that directly target them cannot be inferred, but their lack of imitation suggests limited inclination toward generalized reciprocity based solely on seeing others reward.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey witness a generally high-cooperation group with both sanctioning and rewarding activity by others. Their main behavioral adjustment is to lower their own contribution while continuing to avoid both punishment and reward. They neither imitate the punishers nor the rewarders, and they do not respond in kind to the presence of either strategy. Instead, they treat others’ costly enforcement and reinforcement as part of the environment they can benefit from without participating. Their contribution reduction, despite others’ pro-social spending, indicates that they do not feel compelled to “do their part” in terms of enforcement or over-contribution; they appear comfortable letting others shoulder the social and monetary costs of sustaining cooperation.

Contributions are relatively stable across rounds with only a mild downward adjustment, suggesting conditional cooperation rather than blind altruism. They appear to follow a fairness norm where strong contributors—especially those at or near the top—are the reference point. Individuals contributing clearly less than the strong contributors are tolerated rather than sanctioned, indicating a cooperative but non‑moralistic stance. They seem willing to give up substantial private payoff to support the public good despite the relatively low marginal per-capita return, implying low payoff-maximizing selfishness and higher weight on group efficiency and/or norm adherence. Risk tolerance regarding being exploited is moderate: they do not immediately drop to low contributions despite heterogeneity in others’ behavior, but they also do not push to full contribution throughout, suggesting they balance idealism with cautious adjustment.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey refrain completely from using punishment, even when there are clear low contributors relative to the leading cooperators and when others do enact punishment. This indicates a strong reluctance to engage in costly sanctioning, consistent with a “non-punitive cooperator” or “positive-only enforcer” type. There is no evidence of either deterrence-oriented punishment (to move low contributors upward) or retaliatory punishment (against those who reduce others’ payoffs). Triggers for punishment either do not exist for this player within the observed range of behavior, or are set at an unknown but very high threshold; in any case, they prefer to avoid increasing conflict and efficiency losses. Their strategy appears to be to maintain cooperation via example and rewards rather than via threats.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nUnknown. The player is never punished in the observed interaction, so there is no direct evidence on whether they would respond with forgiveness, compliance (increased contribution), or retaliation. Given their general non-punitive style, a cautious inference is that immediate retaliatory tendencies are low, but this remains speculative and should be treated as low confidence.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey are clearly willing to spend own resources to reward others, and they do so in a discriminating, contribution-contingent way. They selectively reward some of the highest contributors while ignoring medium or low contributors, consistent with a strategic reinforcement motive rather than indiscriminate generosity. The pattern suggests they use rewards to signal approval to strong cooperators and to encourage maintenance of high contributions. They do not appear to use rewards to “pull up” moderate or low contributors; instead, they focus on reinforcing a cooperative elite, perhaps seeing these players as key anchors for group norms or as especially deserving. They accept the cost of rewarding even in a very short game and without guaranteed future interaction awareness, which points to an intrinsic preference for positive reciprocity and norm-affirming behavior rather than a purely forward-looking investment.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nUnknown. They do not receive any rewards in the observed interaction, so there is no evidence of direct reciprocity toward specific benefactors or alliance building via mutual rewarding. Their own use of rewards suggests they value positive reciprocity in principle, but their behavior when personally rewarded cannot be inferred.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey appear attentive to others’ contributions and the resulting outcomes, and they adjust behavior in a targeted way. After observing that some players contribute very highly, they later channel rewards precisely toward several of these top contributors, indicating they integrate others’ past actions into their strategy and are capable of tracking individual histories. The absence of punishment, despite the presence of some relatively low contributors and at least one active punisher, suggests that they are not provoked into negative reactions by others’ lower contributions or by others’ use of sanctions. They tolerate payoff heterogeneity and seem more focused on reinforcing cooperative behavior than on equalizing outcomes or retaliating against norm violators.

They keep their contribution constant rather than adapting to others’ behavior, suggesting a simple, fixed strategy rather than conditional cooperation. They appear to balance self-interest and group benefit, prioritizing a reliable personal payoff over maximizing collective efficiency. Their behavior is consistent with a “tempered egoist”: willing to contribute a non-trivial share but unwilling to match high contributors or chase full-efficiency cooperation. Fairness norms are moderate and self-centered; they do not align with the higher implicit group standard, nor do they attempt to correct this discrepancy via their own contributions. Risk tolerance regarding payoff seems low to moderate—they avoid both full free-riding and full cooperation, staying in a “safe middle” that guarantees solid earnings regardless of others’ choices.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey show a complete reluctance to use punishment, even when others contribute less or more than they do and even when punishment is actively used by some peers. This indicates either a general aversion to costly norm enforcement or a belief that punishing is not worth the cost given the marginal returns in this environment. They do not engage in second-order punishment (punishing free-riders) or sanction contributors whose behavior deviates from their own level. There is no evidence of either deterrence motives or retaliatory motives; they abstain from sanctioning altogether. This suggests a type that is non-confrontational in institutional terms: they prefer to protect their own payoff and let others enforce norms if they wish, rather than taking on the role of enforcer themselves.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nThey are not punished at any point, so their behavioral response to being sanctioned is unknown. There is no evidence on whether they would respond with increased cooperation, retaliation, or forgiveness. Given their general passivity in using punishment, one plausible but low-confidence inference is that they might avoid retaliatory escalation and instead adjust contributions, if at all; however, this is speculative and must be treated as unknown.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey never use the reward option, despite the presence of many high contributors and visible instances of others rewarding. This indicates a strong tendency to avoid prosocial costly signaling when it provides no guaranteed payoff advantage. They do not selectively reward those who contribute more than they do, nor do they strategically reward potential partners or very high contributors. Their non-use of rewards suggests that they either (a) place little value on reinforcing others’ cooperation at their own expense, or (b) see the reward technology as strategically dominated by simply keeping coins. They do not appear to use rewards as a tool for alliance building, reciprocity, or norm expression; their stance is to keep interactions purely through contributions and payoffs rather than secondary transfers.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThey are never rewarded, so there is no direct evidence on how they would respond to identifiable rewarders.

This indicates low behavioral sensitivity to others’ payoffs, costs, or sanctioning patterns. They do not imitate higher contributors, do not punish low contributors, and do not join in rewarding either high contributors or punishers/rewarders. Their type appears observational but detached: they register others’ outcomes enough to see that enforcement is possible and used, but they neither coordinate with nor react to those patterns. This is consistent with an individually focused, low-engagement style: they pursue a stable personal strategy, allow the social environment to evolve around them, and refrain from participating in meta-level governance of cooperation (via punishment or reward).", "umap_x": 1.2803069353103638, "umap_y": -0.709540843963623, "cluster_id": 6, "cluster_size": 31, "cluster_title": "Punishment / Reward / Contribution", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around punishment, reward, contribution, contributions, low."}

They appear willing to accept a personal payoff disadvantage relative to moderate or low contributors, suggesting a pro-social, efficiency-focused orientation and high tolerance for the risk of being exploited. There is no evidence they are strategically shading contributions in response to incentives from punishment or reward; instead, their pattern aligns with a “principled cooperator” type rather than a contingent reciprocator.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThis player never uses the punishment option, even when there are clearly identifiable low contributors who reduce group efficiency and when others are actively punishing or have punished low contributors. This implies either a reluctance to incur personal costs to sanction defectors, an aversion to harming others even for norm-enforcement purposes, or a belief that punishing is not effective or not worth the cost. They show no signs of retaliatory punishment, as they are never targeted themselves and do not engage in second-order punishment against those who spend heavily on punishment.

This suggests a strong internal fairness or efficiency norm that prioritizes maximizing group welfare over personal payoff, at least over short horizons. Their risk tolerance is high with respect to exploitation: they accept the possibility of earning less than many others in order to sustain a cooperative pattern.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThis player does not use punishment at all, even when there are conspicuously low contributors relative to the group. They also refrain from punitive action despite seeing that others are willing to use punishment, including what appears to be antisocial or at least nonstandard targeting. This indicates a strong reluctance to spend resources to reduce others’ payoffs, regardless of whether those others under-contribute. Their behavior is most consistent with a non-punishing, non-enforcing cooperator type, who does not attempt to deter free-riding or correct perceived unfairness via costly sanctions. Since they never punish, any finer distinctions about selectivity, thresholds, or retaliation vs. deterrence motives remain unknown.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nThis player is never punished, so their reactions to being sanctioned are unknown. We do not observe any preemptive defensive changes (such as reducing contributions or starting to punish) in response to seeing punishment used in the group, suggesting that others’ use of punishment does not provoke visible fear, appeasement, or retaliatory tendencies in this player. However, without being directly targeted, their stance toward identifiable punishers—whether forgiving, retaliatory, or compliant—remains of low-confidence and is effectively unknown.\n\n<REWARD>\nThis player does not use reward, even though others are rewarding and the technology for rewarding is publicly known. They do not allocate any resources to positively reinforce high contributors or to build alliances via transfers, despite being themselves a high contributor. This indicates that they separate their cooperation decision from any effort to manipulate or encourage others’ behavior through side payments. Their cooperative stance appears principled rather than strategically reinforced; they contribute fully regardless of whether they can or do reward. Whether they would ever reward in longer or differently structured interactions is unknown, but within this setting they are a pure contributor who does not engage in active norm promotion via rewards.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThe player is rewarded once by a peer and receives the transfer passively, without altering their visible behavioral pattern. They keep contributing fully and do not start rewarding in return, suggesting they do not reciprocate in-kind within the observed window. This may indicate that they treat rewards as incidental rather than as obligations to reciprocate or as the basis for alliance building. They also do not differentially respond to being recognized for cooperation: their cooperative level remains at its maximum regardless of external validation.

Despite this, they neither adjust their contributions downward nor begin using the sanctioning mechanisms.

This indicates a strong group-efficiency orientation and a willingness to sacrifice personal payoff for collective gain. There is no evidence that they modulate contributions based on others’ average contributions, on prior punishment or reward, or on payoff comparisons; their behavior aligns more with an internal norm (“I should fully cooperate”) than with conditional strategies such as matching or punishing free-riders via reduced contributions. Their risk tolerance appears high with respect to exploitation risk: they continue to maximize contributions even when others’ contributions are somewhat lower and heterogeneous, suggesting they do not require assurance of universal high cooperation to maintain their own. Whether they are driven more by fairness, pure altruism, or a preference for socially efficient outcomes is unknown, but they clearly prioritize the public fund over their own immediate earnings and are behaviorally robust to moderate deviations by others.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThis player does not use punishment at all in the observed interaction, despite having opportunities and identifiable targets who contribute less than them. They refrain from sanctioning both clear low contributors and moderate under-contributors, even when those players’ behavior could threaten overall efficiency. This suggests a strong aversion to costly negative sanctions, an emphasis on non-confrontation, or a belief that punishment is either normatively wrong, ineffective, or not worth the cost. There is no evidence of retaliatory motives, as they do not punish any player, including those who spend on punishment generally. They also do not appear to use punishment strategically for deterrence; they do not engage in even low-level or symbolic punishment. Overall, they fit a “non-punishing cooperator” profile: they uphold cooperative norms by their own contributions but avoid enforcing those norms through formal sanctions.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nThe player is never punished in the transcript, so their response to being punished is unknown. There is no behavioral evidence regarding whether they would respond with forgiveness, retaliation, conformity (increasing contributions), or withdrawal (decreasing contributions). Given their stable full-cooperation pattern and non-punitive stance, one could speculate that they might remain cooperative and avoid counter-punishment, but this is not observed; confidence in any such inference is low. Their reactions to identifiable punishers, in terms of future allocations or social targeting, are therefore unknown.\n\n<REWARD>\nThis player does not use the reward mechanism at all, despite many others contributing at medium-to-high levels and some rewarding behavior occurring in the group. Their non-use of rewards suggests they are not inclined to spend extra resources to positively reinforce others, even when those others behave cooperatively. This is consistent with a “pure contributor” type who supports the group solely through their own high contributions rather than through costly social incentives. It might indicate a preference to conserve resources once their own cooperation is established, or a belief that the main channel for influencing the group should be contributions rather than side payments; however, their underlying motive is uncertain. They also do not use reward strategically (for example, to build alliances or to encourage particular high contributors), indicating low engagement with the incentive layer beyond their own cooperative choice.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThe player receives rewards from others but does not respond in kind, either by rewarding those who rewarded them or by expanding their use of the reward mechanism more generally. They maintain the same behavioral pattern—full contribution and no incentive use—after being rewarded. This suggests they do not adopt reciprocal rewarding strategies, at least within the short horizon observed. Their cooperation does not appear contingent on positive reinforcement; instead, it seems internally motivated and stable, unaffected by whether others acknowledge it materially. They also do not shift into targeted reciprocity (e.g., selectively rewarding their benefactors), so there is no evidence of alliance-building or dyadic reciprocity in their incentive use. Any emotional reaction (gratitude vs indifference) is unknown; behaviorally, they remain a non-rewarding, non-punishing cooperator.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThe player observes heterogeneous contributions, as well as others spending on both punishment and reward, yet they do not adjust their behavior in visible ways. They neither imitate punishers or rewarders, nor do they react to the overall payoff structure by changing their own contribution or incentive use. This indicates low behavioral responsiveness to others’ payoffs and sanctioning choices, at least over the short run. They do not appear to target low contributors with punishment, nor high contributors with reward, even when the outcome information makes such targets obvious. This suggests they do not actively engage in norm enforcement—neither rewarding prosociality nor sanctioning deviations—and instead follow a simple personal rule: contribute fully, ignore the incentive stage. They also do not react to others’ punishment expenditures by protecting or retaliating on behalf of targets; third-party enforcement or counter-punishment behavior is absent.

They start with a clearly below-group contribution, then move closer to (but still below) the group norm when they see that others are largely cooperative. This indicates that they are responsive to observed cooperation but do not aim to match or exceed the prevailing level. They appear sensitive to payoff efficiency: they keep a significant portion for themselves even in a highly cooperative environment, suggesting they prioritize personal earnings over maximizing collective returns. Their adjustment in the second decision shows some learning and mild norm adjustment rather than rigid free-riding. There is no clear evidence of strong fairness norms (they remain one of the lower contributors) or of risk-seeking altruism; instead they seem to hedge—cooperating enough to benefit from the public fund while preserving individual payoff. Their behavior is stable in direction (never moving toward full free-riding or full contribution), implying a preference for moderate, controlled cooperation rather than extremes.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey show zero willingness to use punishment, despite having visible examples of others both under- and over-contributing relative to the apparent group norm. This applies equally to clear low contributors and to any perceived norm violators; they do not act against anyone. This strongly suggests an “anti-punishment” or at least “punishment-averse” stance. Likely motives include avoiding costs that don’t have guaranteed personal payoff benefits and possibly a reluctance to engage in confrontation, even when sanctions are transparent and potentially norm-enforcing. There is no evidence that they attempt to use punishment strategically (for deterrence or retaliation), nor that their punishment stance changes with experience; they remain entirely inactive in this channel. Whether this is driven by principle (dislike of harming others) or pure cost–benefit thinking is unknown.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nThey are never punished, so their reaction to being sanctioned is unknown. Given their consistently non-punitive behavior and moderate contributions, it is plausible—but not demonstrable—that they would be more inclined to adjust behavior quietly rather than retaliate if punished. However, any claim about forgiveness, compliance, or counter-punishment would be speculative; evidence is absent, so their response to punishers must be labeled unknown.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey also never reward anyone, even when cooperative behavior is clearly observable and reward is relatively inexpensive. This indicates a strong reluctance to spend on positive reinforcement. The absence of rewarding despite receiving a reward themselves suggests that they do not adopt reciprocity or reward-based coalition-building as a strategy. Their behavior is consistent with a narrow payoff-maximizing orientation in the secondary stage: they avoid both costly punishment and costly reward. There is no sign that they use rewards to signal gratitude, encourage high contributors, or shape norms; they effectively treat the reward mechanism as dominated by saving coins. Whether they interpret others’ rewards as social signals or ignore them in their own strategic calculus is unknown.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThey do receive a reward at one point but do not reciprocate to anyone afterward. This shows no observable gratitude behavior and no attempt to form dyadic alliances via mutual rewarding. They neither start rewarding in general nor reward the specific benefactor (identity is known). This pattern is compatible with a type that treats incoming rewards as windfall gains rather than as obligations to reciprocate. It also suggests they do not strongly internalize “reward as social norm cue”; they don’t shift toward more generous contribution or prosocial sanctioning after being positively singled out. Overall, their response to reward is passive: they accept it without changing strategy in observable ways.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey observe a group that is generally cooperative, with some variation and visible use of both punishment and reward by others, yet they keep a conservative, low-cost stance in all sanctioning domains. They neither join in punishing an under-contributor nor in supporting those who spend on reward. This indicates a “quiet beneficiary” attitude: they take advantage of a cooperative environment without actively investing in norm enforcement or social grooming. There is no evidence that others’ costs (either to punish or reward) trigger any mimicking or compensatory behavior. Likewise, they do not adjust contributions upward to align with the highest cooperators or to reward those who bear enforcement costs. Their adaptation is limited to a modest increase in contribution, consistent with learning that others are broadly cooperative, but without any move toward active stewardship of the group outcome. Their beliefs about others’ motives (e.g., fairness vs. spite vs. generosity) are unknown, but behaviorally they react minimally to heterogeneous payoffs and sanctioning patterns, maintaining a low-engagement, payoff-protective profile.", "umap_x": 1.3880358934402466, "umap_y": -0.5597370266914368, "cluster_id": 6, "cluster_size": 31, "cluster_title": "Punishment / Reward / Contribution", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around punishment, reward, contribution, contributions, low."}

They reliably give more than a purely self-interested minimum and stay near the group’s central tendency rather than at the extremes. Their contributions are somewhat sensitive to context: when they see that others include some noticeably low contributors, they slightly reduce their own contribution but do not move toward outright free-riding. This suggests conditional cooperation grounded in a rough fairness norm: they are willing to do their part and a bit more, but are disinclined to subsidize others far beyond what they perceive as a reasonable share. They appear risk-aware: they avoid the risk of being among the very lowest contributors, but also avoid the foregone-payoff risk of contributing at the very top when not everyone matches that level. Their behavior indicates a pragmatic, payoff-conscious cooperator rather than a strict altruist or a strict egoist.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThis player never uses punishment, even when some others contribute much less than the modal group level. They show no evidence of enforcing norms through costly sanctions. This can indicate several overlapping tendencies: a preference to conserve resources for direct payoff, an aversion to conflict or hostility, and/or skepticism about the effectiveness of punishment in this environment. They do not engage in retaliation; even when low contributors exist and at least one peer uses punishment against others, they refrain entirely. Their nonuse is consistent and unconditional across different contribution patterns, suggesting that “non-punisher” is a stable strategic feature for them rather than a context-specific choice. Whether they would ever punish extreme free-riding is unknown, but their demonstrated threshold for acting appears relatively high or absent.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nThis player is never punished, so their response to being sanctioned is unknown. There is no observable retaliation, compliance shift directed at a specific punisher, or forgiveness pattern, because they receive no deductions and see no one targeting them. How they would react if a clearly identifiable peer punished them—by changing contributions, punishing back, or ignoring it—is therefore speculative and must be treated as unknown.\n\n<REWARD>\nThis player never uses rewards, even though many others contribute generously and some peers do use rewards. They do not spend to positively reinforce high contributors or to build explicit alliances. This suggests they prioritize direct monetary payoff over investing in others’ goodwill or future cooperation through rewards, at least over the short horizon they perceive. It may also reflect a belief that contributions are already high enough without additional incentives, or that their own cooperative level is sufficient without further signaling. Their nonuse of rewards is consistent and not contingent on others’ generosity levels, pointing to a baseline “non-rewarder” or strictly budget-conserving stance in both positive and negative sanctioning.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThis player is not rewarded by anyone, so their reaction to receiving identifiable positive transfers is unknown. There is no evidence of direct reciprocity, alliance formation, or increased contributions in response to personal rewards, because such an event does not occur. Whether they would respond with reciprocal rewards, higher cooperation, or simple gratitude-without-action is therefore unknown.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThis player observes that most peers contribute at relatively high levels, some spend on punishment or rewards, and overall payoffs are solid. Their only clear behavioral adjustment in light of these outcomes is a modest downward shift in their own contribution when it becomes evident that a few group members are under-contributing relative to the cooperative majority. They do not emulate others’ use of sanctions, nor do they compensate for observed punishment or reward patterns. The presence of both prosocial and norm-enforcing behaviors from others does not induce them to join in; they remain focused on their own contribution and payoff structure. Overall, they appear to update primarily on the distribution of contributions (especially noticing low contributors) rather than on who spends to punish or reward, and they respond by fine-tuning their own generosity rather than actively reshaping others’ behavior.", "umap_x": 1.2345237731933594, "umap_y": -1.2643346786499023, "cluster_id": 6, "cluster_size": 31, "cluster_title": "Punishment / Reward / Contribution", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around punishment, reward, contribution, contributions, low."}

They neither free-ride nor fully sacrifice their entire endowment, instead choosing a generous but self-preserving level. Their contributions are stable across rounds with only minor adjustment, suggesting they condition their behavior on the group environment but do not overreact. They appear to accept moderate inequality in contributions (both above and below them) without trying to exactly match others or enforce strict fairness. Their pattern is consistent with someone who values cooperation and group returns while also attending to their own payoff. Risk tolerance seems moderate: they are willing to risk personal coins to support the public fund, but they do not push into extreme, uncompensated generosity. There is no clear evidence of strong inequity aversion or of a strategy aimed at precisely maximizing monetary payoff; instead, they strike a middle ground between prosociality and self-interest.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThis player makes no use of punishment despite having opportunities and observable cases of lower contributors. They do not engage in either norm-enforcing punishment of low contributors or retaliatory punishment, and they also do not punish apparent “over-spenders” on punishment or reward. This indicates a strong reluctance to spend personal resources to reduce others’ payoffs, even when doing so might deter free-riding. Their type aligns with a non-punitive cooperator: they cooperate themselves but do not try to discipline the group. Whether this stems from moral discomfort with harming others, skepticism about punishment effectiveness, or pure payoff-maximizing avoidance of costly sanctioning is unknown. Overall, they prioritize maintaining their own payoff and avoiding conflict over shaping others’ behavior via punishment.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nThey are never punished in the observed interaction, so their behavioral response to being sanctioned is unknown. There is no evidence of anticipatory adjustment specifically aimed at avoiding punishment, nor of any retaliatory tendencies. If punished in the future, it is unclear whether they would respond with compliance (increased cooperation), forgiveness (no change), or counter-punishment; confidence on all such inferences is low.\n\n<REWARD>\nThis player does not reward others at any point, even when many others contribute at high levels and when some peers engage in rewarding or punitive activity. They are therefore an unrewarding cooperator: they contribute generously themselves but do not spend additional resources to transfer payoff to others. There is no sign of targeted positive reinforcement toward high contributors or toward those who appear prosocial in other ways. The most parsimonious interpretation is that they value cooperation but treat reward as an unnecessary or inefficient expense, preferring to let their own contribution be their main prosocial act. Whether they refrain from rewarding due to cost–benefit calculation, indifference to expressive gratitude, or lack of belief in reward as an effective signal is unknown.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThey never receive any reward, so there is no direct evidence on how they respond when positively singled out. Their propensity to reciprocate, form alliances, or increase contributions in response to rewards from identifiable partners is unknown. Given their general pattern (cooperate but do not transfer), it is uncertain whether even receiving a reward would induce them to start rewarding others.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey observe a group with overall high cooperation and some heterogeneous use of punishment and reward by others. Despite seeing others spend on sanctions and bonuses, they keep their own contribution policy relatively stable and never adopt others’ sanctioning behavior. This suggests a certain independence of strategy: they do not mimic punitive or rewarding norms even when those behaviors are visible. They also do not visibly react to peers’ varied payoffs—high or low—through compensatory reward or corrective punishment. Their behavior is consistent with someone who is mainly focused on their own cooperative stance and earnings, rather than actively managing inequality or disciplining exploitative patterns in the group.

Across the game, they choose only the extreme options allowed (all or nothing) and end up favoring zero contribution much more often than full contribution. Their behavior indicates they recognize that, at the given multiplier and group size, individually it is always more profitable to keep their endowment when at least one other player contributes.\n\nThey show some volatility early and mid-game: they alternate between contributing everything and contributing nothing in a way that appears exploratory rather than driven by a stable fairness norm. Full contributions occur both when others are contributing and when others are not, suggesting they test whether their own cooperation can “jump-start” group contributions, but they quickly revert to free-riding when this does not yield good relative payoffs.\n\nThey respond strongly to payoff incentives: when others contribute and they do not, they obtain high payoffs, and they subsequently repeat the free-riding choice in similar circumstances. When they contribute and the others do not, they incur the worst payoff and are less likely to repeat that pattern in the immediately following round. There is no stable norm of equal sharing or reciprocity; the player appears comfortable benefiting disproportionately from others’ cooperation.\n\nRisk tolerance appears moderate: they are willing a few times to risk full contribution even after having been exploited or after seeing that unilateral cooperation is costly, but they do not sustain such risks. Over time, their strategy converges toward exploiting cooperative actions by others while avoiding being exploited themselves. By the end of the game, they act as a near-pure defector, with no final cooperative “gesture” despite the absence of punishment or reward.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nUnknown. There is no chat content in the transcript, so their tone, persuasion attempts, and responsiveness in communication cannot be inferred. It is unknown whether they prefer engagement or avoidance in verbal or textual interaction.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThe player appears horizon-aware in the sense that there is no late-game surge in cooperation; instead, they maintain or strengthen their non-contributory behavior as the game progresses. In the final stretch, they do not attempt to build or repair cooperation and display no sign of an “end-game gift” or reputation-building motive. Their choices remain aligned with immediate self-payoff maximization, not with long-term or terminal-round fairness concerns.\n\nThere is no discernible decay from a high initial cooperative standard; rather, after some early and mid-game experimentation with full contributions, they settle into a low-contribution mode that persists through the last rounds. End-game conditions therefore amplify their existing preference for free-riding rather than triggering any cooperative deviation.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThe player is highly sensitive to others’ contribution patterns and associated payoffs and adjusts in ways that preserve or improve their relative advantage. When they see others contributing while they do not, and this yields them superior earnings, they readily continue to choose non-contribution in similar contexts, effectively exploiting others’ cooperation without apparent hesitation.\n\nWhen they experience being the sole or primary contributor and observe that this gives others a clear payoff advantage, they soon revert to non-contribution, indicating aversion to being the “sucker.” There is no behavioral evidence of altruistic satisfaction in boosting others’ incomes at net cost to themselves; any such actions are short-lived and followed by corrective shifts back toward self-protective behavior.\n\nThey do not appear to enforce any fairness norm through their own contributions: they sometimes cooperate when others do not and sometimes free-ride when others do, without a consistent reciprocity rule. Instead, their pattern suggests a learning process focused on relative payoff: cooperative experiments that leave them behind are quickly abandoned, while configurations that reward free-riding are repeated. Their reactions to symmetric outcomes (everyone earning the same when all contribute zero) are neutral in the sense that they do not respond by pushing the group toward higher joint payoffs; equality at a low level of efficiency appears acceptable as long as they are not personally disadvantaged.", "umap_x": -0.060009993612766266, "umap_y": 0.684586226940155, "cluster_id": 5, "cluster_size": 37, "cluster_title": "Reward / Cooperation / Contribution", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around reward, cooperation, contribution, free, contributions."}

This pattern is the default and is repeatedly returned to after brief deviations, indicating a stable primary preference for maximizing own payoff via free-riding rather than sustaining public-good efficiency.\n\nTheir contributions are binary and extreme: they either fully contribute or not at all; there is no gradation. This suggests they are not fine-tuning around marginal incentives but instead testing discrete strategic modes (all-or-nothing). The rare full contributions appear in isolated bursts. These are not followed by sustained cooperative behavior from the player, and they revert quickly to zero contributions even when cooperation could persist. This points to low intrinsic commitment to fairness or symmetric reciprocity.\n\nTheir cooperative moves do not clearly track others’ immediate behavior in a consistent conditional pattern. Sometimes they contribute fully when another player contributes; at other times, they withhold when others contribute. There is thus no stable “I match what others do” strategy. Instead, their behavior is best described as low-commitment and exploratory: they intermittently test high contributions but do not anchor on them even when they are exploited.\n\nThey accept being the sucker in cooperative configurations several times, yet do not escalate contributions or try to “rescue” cooperation thereafter. Likewise, when they benefit from other players’ contributions, they do not respond with compensating generosity. Overall, they tolerate payoff asymmetries in their favor or against them without clear corrective action, suggesting a weak fairness norm in either direction.\n\nRisk tolerance is moderate: they are willing to risk making full contributions under uncertainty about others’ choices, but these attempts are infrequent relative to the number of opportunities. When those attempts yield low relative payoffs, they quickly fall back to non-contribution. Over the entire game, their revealed preference is to prioritize secure individual earnings over uncertain gains from mutual cooperation.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nUnknown. There is no observable chat content from the focal player in the transcript, so their tone, coordination attempts, and responsiveness in communication cannot be inferred.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThe player shows clear awareness of the finite horizon, adjusting behavior as the end approaches. In the final stretch, their pattern converges back to consistent non-contribution and stays there through the last round, even when others intermittently contribute. They do not attempt a final cooperative push or last-round “fairness gesture.”\n\nEarlier in the game, they occasionally experiment with full contributions, but these attempts do not increase in frequency or intensity as the remaining number of rounds declines. Instead, nearing the end, they act more like a strict free-rider, indicating a classic end-game defection tendency: with less future interaction value, they see little reason to contribute.\n\nThey do not attempt to leverage late-stage rounds for reputation building or reciprocal signaling, despite full observability of payoffs. This suggests they are not prioritizing long-term relational or reputational benefits in this environment and treat the game largely as a series of payoff opportunities with a particularly self-focused stance near the conclusion.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThe player observes substantial variation in others’ payoffs across rounds: sometimes others earn less when they shoulder cooperative costs, sometimes they earn more when they free-ride on the player’s contributions, and sometimes everyone earns the same when all defect. Despite this, the focal player does not lock into a stable punitive withdrawal or compensatory cooperation pattern.\n\nWhen others’ cooperative behavior allows the focal player to earn higher payoffs while contributing nothing, the player continues to free-ride rather than “reward” past generosity with future contributions. When others exploit the focal player’s full contributions and gain higher payoffs, the player does not counter by trying to restore fairness via subsequent over-contribution or by attempting to re-establish mutual cooperation; instead, they mostly revert to defection.\n\nThey thus appear relatively insensitive to payoff imbalances in either direction at the level of moral or emotional response. Their adaptations seem driven more by simple payoff comparison (cooperation not reliably paying more for them) than by concern over distributive justice.\n\nBecause no explicit punishment or reward tools are available and no communication content is shown, their internal emotional response to others’ outcomes is unknown; what can be seen is that these outcomes only weakly and inconsistently shape their own subsequent contributions. Their behavioral type is best captured as payoff-attentive but norm-light: they notice when cooperation does not benefit them and then default to self-serving non-contribution rather than engaging in any systematic reciprocity, positive or negative.", "umap_x": 0.06988239288330078, "umap_y": 0.7049128413200378, "cluster_id": 5, "cluster_size": 37, "cluster_title": "Reward / Cooperation / Contribution", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around reward, cooperation, contribution, free, contributions."}

They never contribute partially; they only choose between full contribution and full defection, suggesting a simple, binary heuristic rather than fine-tuned optimization.\n\nTheir baseline tendency is to keep their entire endowment and rely on others to contribute. Periods of zero contribution are long and frequent. Full contributions appear sporadically and are not sustained, even after others cooperate simultaneously. Cooperation is unstable: the player does not build or maintain a cooperative norm over time.\n\nTheir decisions are strongly conditional on others’ behavior but in a self-serving way. When at least one partner contributes while the other defects, they often defect themselves, exploiting the contributing partner. They also sometimes contribute when exactly one partner contributes, which benefits the non-contributor as well, indicating that any norm they use is not strictly “reward cooperators, punish defectors” but rather opportunistic and inconsistent.\n\nThey show no clear fairness norm in the sense of trying to equalize payoffs or match others’ efforts. They repeatedly accept payoff advantages obtained by free-riding on others’ full contributions and do not reciprocate in a stable fashion when others later contribute. When they do contribute, they are willing to earn less than co-players in that period, indicating that their behavior is not purely myopic payoff-maximization; however, this does not translate into a persistent cooperative strategy.\n\nRisk tolerance regarding “being the only cooperator” seems moderate: they occasionally choose to contribute even when partners have just defected, accepting the risk of being exploited again. However, these cooperative moves do not escalate into a higher, stable contribution level; they remain isolated experiments or short-lived deviations rather than a shift in type.\n\nOverall, the player is best characterized as a payoff-focused, intermittently experimental cooperator who defaults to free-riding and does not commit to long-run mutual cooperation.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThere is no observed chat content from this player. Their communication style, tone, and responsiveness via messages are therefore unknown. Any social signaling, persuasion attempts, or explicit coordination are absent from the record (unknown whether by choice or by lack of opportunity).\n\nTheir “communication” must be inferred solely from contributions as signals. Through actions, they alternate between cooperative and exploitative roles without forming a clear, consistent “message” to others about desired group norms. Because these signals are inconsistent and never stabilized into repeated mutual cooperation, they do not effectively coordinate the group.\n\nOverall communication profile: explicit communication is unknown; implicit communication via contributions is ambiguous and unreliable, not clearly aimed at building shared expectations.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThe player shows no strong end-game escalation of cooperation and no clear final-round “fairness” gesture. Contributions in the latter part of the game remain binary and inconsistent, with several late free-riding choices interspersed with occasional full contributions.\n\nThey appear horizon-aware in the sense that they do not build up cooperation as the game progresses; instead, they maintain a primarily self-regarding strategy and do not invest in long-term reputation or future reciprocity, which is consistent with awareness that the interaction is finite and relatively short. However, there is no sharp, monotonic decay of contributions right at the end; rather, the same unstable pattern continues through the closing rounds, including a mix of cooperation and defection close to the final round.\n\nAny sophisticated end-game strategy (such as early cooperation followed by planned late defection) is not clearly implemented. Instead, the player maintains a fluctuating approach, with defection as the dominant choice, through to the end. Their final actions are consistent with their overall type: opportunistic, non-committal, and not especially concerned with concluding on a cooperative or fair note.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThe player appears highly reactive to others’ contribution patterns and resulting payoffs, but the direction of adaptation is mostly opportunistic free-riding rather than reciprocity. When others bear the cost of contribution and end up with lower payoffs than the player, the player frequently continues or switches to free-riding, indicating that observing others’ disadvantage does not trigger compensatory cooperation.\n\nThey do sometimes increase their own contribution after observing others contribute, but this response is inconsistent and short-lived. The player does not reliably “reward” cooperative partners by matching their contributions in subsequent rounds, nor do they consistently “punish” defectors by refusing to contribute when those partners previously free-rode. Instead, they repeatedly accept payoff distributions in which either (a) they themselves are exploited when they contribute and others defect, or (b) they exploit others who contribute when they defect.\n\nThis tolerance for both roles—being exploited and exploiting—suggests that their primary adjustment to others’ outcomes is exploratory rather than norm-enforcing. They seem to test whether contributing will lead to improved personal outcomes and readily revert to defection when it does not, rather than attempting to stabilize a cooperative equilibrium or enforce fairness. Emotional reactions (such as resentment or guilt) cannot be inferred from the data and are unknown.\n\nIn summary, the player observes others’ outcomes enough to condition behavior, but uses this information mainly to search for personally advantageous patterns, not to uphold mutual cooperation or equity.", "umap_x": -0.16493187844753265, "umap_y": 0.8068503141403198, "cluster_id": 5, "cluster_size": 37, "cluster_title": "Reward / Cooperation / Contribution", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around reward, cooperation, contribution, free, contributions."}

Contributions stay in a low-to-mid range most of the time, with a single clear attempt at higher cooperation that is not sustained. They appear attentive to the group’s average behavior and adjust within a band rather than holding a rigid rule. When others’ contributions are high, they are willing to raise theirs, but only temporarily and not to the very top of the group. When contributions around them fall, they are comfortable keeping theirs low as well. There is no sign of a strong fairness-enforcement norm (they do not clearly match others’ contributions or penalize low contributors via the reward tool), and they seem more concerned with maintaining a reasonable personal payoff than with maximizing collective returns. Overall, they act as a cautious conditional cooperator: responsive to the environment but anchored around self-protection rather than norm leadership. Risk tolerance appears moderate; they are willing to experiment with higher giving once but revert back when that does not clearly benefit them.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey never spend on rewards at any point, even though rewarding is sometimes used extensively by others. This suggests a strong reluctance to incur any direct cost for social signaling or norm reinforcement. They do not selectively reward high contributors, consistent helpers, or those who reward them; in fact, they do not reward anyone at all. They therefore do not use the reward mechanism strategically to build alliances, to encourage cooperation, or to express approval. Their behavior fits a “reward-averse observer”: they rely on the presence of others’ rewards but do not participate, preserving their own payoff instead. This indicates low willingness to sacrifice for indirect, reputational, or future-oriented gains in this environment, at least given the observed group dynamics. Whether this stems from skepticism about the efficacy of rewards, indifference to social signaling, or simple payoff-maximization is unknown, but their consistent non-use of rewards shows that any such motives are dominated by the desire to avoid these costs.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThey receive rewards at some points from others, but they never reciprocate with rewards of their own, either to those specific individuals or in general. They do not appear to change their contribution pattern in any obvious way following being rewarded; their contributions continue to fluctuate within the same general band as before. This suggests they do not treat rewards as an obligation-creating gesture or as a cue to form a cooperative sub-coalition. They neither “pay back” nor “pay forward” rewards, and they also do not escalate their contributions in response to having been singled out positively. Their implicit stance toward rewarders is thus passive: they take the benefit but do not respond materially.

Despite this, they do not emulate high-cost rewarding, do not reward those who incur such costs, and do not retaliate against or adjust specifically toward any particular player type (e.g., large rewarders, large free-riders, or large contributors). Their core reaction to others’ outcomes is to quietly adjust their own contributions within a limited range, seemingly guided by the overall cooperation level rather than by individuals’ fates or identities. They remain unmoved by dramatic payoff differences created through rewards, neither joining in nor compensating for them. This indicates a relatively individualistic or detached social style: they pay enough attention to the group pattern to avoid standing out too much, but they do not engage in active norm-shaping or relational dynamics.

At the same time, they are payoff-aware; after periods of heavy spending or low returns they pull back, indicating a sensitivity to net gains. Overall, they behave like a “conditional cooperator with opportunistic deviations,” balancing social preference and material payoff.\n\n<REWARD>\nThis player is an active but selective user of the reward mechanism. They are willing to incur non-trivial costs to reward others across many rounds, but do not reward in every opportunity. Their rewarding is not blanket generosity; instead, it targets specific players whose behavior they likely interpret as especially cooperative, constructive, or supportive of their own interests.\n\nThey do not use reward as a purely efficiency-based tool (since the mechanism here is cost-neutral in aggregate). Instead, they treat reward as a signaling device and a way to shape norms: they repeatedly spend to recognize high contributors in the group and, at times, to support or acknowledge particular individuals, even when those individuals are not the absolute top contributors. This pattern suggests they may be trying to stabilize cooperative clusters and encourage allies rather than maximize short-run payoffs.\n\nThey also appear to react to their own payoff history: after periods of heavy reward expenditure and low personal returns, their willingness to spend drops sharply for a while, then returns in more modest doses. This implies they monitor the cost-benefit balance of rewarding and adjust intensity accordingly, rather than sticking dogmatically to a moral rule.\n\nOverall, they use reward strategically for norm reinforcement and relationship management, not as indiscriminate altruism.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThe player reliably notices and responds when others direct reward toward them. When they receive substantial reward, they subsequently maintain or increase their cooperative stance rather than exploiting the trust. They also show a tendency to direct rewards toward individuals who have previously supported them or behaved in ways beneficial to them, indicating some degree of positive reciprocity.\n\nHowever, their reciprocity is not automatic or symmetric; they do not simply “pay back” every unit of reward. Instead, they appear to integrate incoming rewards into a broader assessment of who is a valuable partner or cooperator. They are more likely to continue cooperating and occasionally reward those who treat them well, but they still weigh their own payoff and the broader group pattern.\n\nThey do not retaliate against those who ignore or fail to reward them; absence of reward is not treated as an offense. This suggests a reciprocity norm that is appreciative rather than vengeful: they reward being rewarded, but they do not punish its absence. Their response pattern is consistent with alliance-building through mutual reinforcement rather than strict accounting.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThis player pays attention to others’ contributions, payoffs, and reward expenditures and adjusts behavior in nuanced ways. They appear especially sensitive to extreme reward spending by a small subset of peers: when someone spends heavily to reward them, they respond with increased own payoff-seeking in subsequent play, but also show restraint in how much they themselves spend afterward, as if recognizing the unsustainability of that pattern.\n\nThey seem to interpret very high contributions and massive reward outlays by some others as exploitable but also fragile: they sometimes free-ride in those contexts (taking advantage of a generous environment), then revert to more moderate, group-aligned contributions once the extremes subside. This indicates an ability to opportunistically exploit but not fully undermine the cooperative structure, suggesting a pragmatic, payoff-conscious orientation rather than either pure exploitation or pure idealism.\n\nThey do not react negatively to low contributors or to players who consistently avoid spending on reward; there is no sign of punitive motives or moralistic withholding beyond their own cost–benefit calculations. Instead, they primarily update on aggregate patterns—who tends to contribute, who tends to spend to support others, and how that affects their own earnings—and then adjust their own contribution and reward levels accordingly. Their social style is thus strategic, observant, and mildly self-serving, but not antagonistic.", "umap_x": 1.7608072757720947, "umap_y": 0.9364721179008484, "cluster_id": 7, "cluster_size": 36, "cluster_title": "Reward / Contributions / High", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around reward, contributions, high, rewards, contribution."}

Their baseline is to keep the majority of their endowment and contribute a small single-digit amount. They do not steadily escalate toward high cooperation, nor do they free-ride completely; instead, they hover at low-to-moderate contributions with a few spikes. These spikes toward higher giving appear exploratory rather than sustained commitments and are not followed by continued high cooperation even when others’ contributions are often substantial. They do not strongly condition their own giving on the exact pattern of others’ contributions; when others range from very low to very high, this player still mostly maintains low levels. This suggests a weak conditional cooperation tendency and a stronger default preference for self-payoff protection. They appear aware that contributing more reduces their own payoff and do not sacrifice much to move the group closer to social optimum, indicating relatively low altruism and low willingness to bear personal cost for group benefit. There is no visible fairness correction behavior (e.g., systematically matching others, retaliating by dropping to zero, or rewarding “just” contribution levels through their own giving); instead, they seem to prioritize a personally comfortable, low-risk contribution level and only occasionally test deviations from it. Overall, their type fits a “guarded low contributor” who values personal earnings and treats the public contribution decision conservatively, with limited responsiveness to group norms.\n\n<REWARD>\nThis player almost never spends on rewards and is effectively a non-rewarder. In nearly all rounds they pay nothing to influence others via the reward mechanism, even when there are clear high contributors and clear low contributors in the group and even though rewarders are visible. On the rare occasion they do spend on reward, the spending is very small and not repeated, and there is no clear pattern of using rewards to build alliances, reinforce cooperation, or signal gratitude. Because they do not systematically target high contributors or reciprocate prior rewards, it is difficult to infer a principled reward rule beyond possible ad hoc experimentation. They behave as if rewards are not a tool they wish to use: they keep the cost savings for themselves, even though the tech is efficient in a narrow sense (one-to-one). This pattern suggests low willingness to incur direct costs for social shaping, very low use of positive reciprocity as an instrument, and a largely myopic focus on immediate payoff rather than on strategic investment in others’ future behavior. Any strategic use of reward, if it exists, is weak and inconsistent; the safe inference is that they are a “reward-averse” type who largely ignores the reward option.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThis player is rewarded multiple times yet never clearly reciprocates to those rewarders. They do not start rewarding after being rewarded, nor do they visibly direct rare rewards specifically back toward prior benefactors. They also do not increase their own contributions in a way that would suggest a gratitude-based shift toward greater cooperation following receipt of rewards. Their behavior indicates that they treat incoming rewards as windfall gains rather than as signals calling for reciprocation or alliance formation. They do not appear to use the identifiable nature of rewarders to build stable cooperative relationships. Because there is no punishment in this environment, we cannot observe their response to punitive actions, but from their reaction to positive incentives they seem largely unresponsive to social overtures: they accept benefits without changing their own cooperative or rewarding behavior. This is consistent with a “non-reciprocating beneficiary” profile: willing to take advantage of others’ prosociality but not motivated to return favors, even when social ties or visibility might matter.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThis player observes wide variation in others’ contributions, reward expenditures, and resulting payoffs, including extreme cases where some peers sacrifice large amounts on rewards and others consistently free-ride or contribute heavily. Despite this, the player’s own decisions remain relatively stable and self-focused. They do not copy the behavior of generous rewarders, do not escalate contributions in response to visible high payoffs for cooperators, and do not retaliate by reducing contributions when free-riders or low contributors earn high payoffs. The presence of peers who burn substantial resources on rewards does not spur them to join that behavior or to adjust their own giving. They also show no clear tendency to exploit highly altruistic others more aggressively (e.g., dropping to zero contributions once it is clear some players are very giving); instead, they simply maintain their usual low-to-moderate contribution pattern and continue to avoid using the reward mechanism. This suggests that they pay attention to outcomes enough to see that their own payoffs stay adequate without extra effort, and conclude that there is no need to change. Their learning and adaptation are minimal: they neither chase the highest possible payoff strategies observed in others nor respond to fairness or inequality signals with corrective behavior. Personality-wise, this is compatible with a quietly self-interested, low-engagement type: not hostile, not particularly norm-enforcing, and not strongly normative about equality, but instead keeping to a comfortable, low-cost path largely independent of the social dynamics around them.", "umap_x": 2.1424341201782227, "umap_y": 0.434304803609848, "cluster_id": 7, "cluster_size": 36, "cluster_title": "Reward / Contributions / High", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around reward, contributions, high, rewards, contribution."}

They keep their contribution at a small fixed level most of the time and only make very small adjustments. Their behavior indicates a preference for taking a reliable private payoff over pushing for high group efficiency, even when others frequently contribute much more. They show no strong evidence of conditional cooperation: they neither clearly raise their contribution when group contributions are high nor reduce it when others contribute very little. Instead, they appear to follow a simple rule-of-thumb contribution that they regard as “enough” to avoid being a complete defector while still maximizing personal earnings. There is no sign that they use contribution levels to enforce fairness or to match others’ behavior. Their persistence in this low but nonzero pattern, even in the face of wide variation in others’ contributions, suggests low sensitivity to social norms of strong cooperation and a primary focus on own payoff with mild concern for not looking entirely selfish. Risk tolerance and loss aversion are unknown; however, their unwillingness to experiment with larger contributions, even when high contributions are common, hints at a cautious, payoff-protective stance.\n\n<REWARD>\nThis player never spends on rewards in any round, despite the presence of clearly identifiable, often generous contributors and repeated opportunities to reinforce them. Their willingness to incur any personal cost to shape others’ behavior appears effectively zero in this environment. They do not use rewards as strategic tools, neither to build alliances with high contributors nor to encourage cooperation from low or unstable contributors. This holds even when others spend heavily on rewards and when the reward technology is transparent. The absence of any attempt to reward suggests that they either (a) do not believe rewards will substantially change others’ behavior, (b) do not value reciprocal or norm-enforcing relationships enough to pay for them, or (c) adopt a narrowly self-regarding strategy focused on immediate material payoff. They also do not use rewards as expressions of gratitude or as symbolic gestures, given that some others clearly behave in ways that could warrant such social recognition. Overall, they are a pure non-rewarder.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThe player occasionally receives small amounts of reward from others, but never reciprocates toward those individuals or toward any rewarder in general. When they are rewarded, their subsequent contributions do not change in a way that suggests gratitude-based reciprocity or alliance building; they continue to follow their low, stable contribution rule. They also do not respond with “return rewards” when rewarders are easily identifiable. This pattern indicates that they interpret incoming rewards primarily as windfall income rather than as social signals that call for a response. They do not appear to engage in indirect reciprocity, network-building, or reward-based coalition formation. If they update beliefs from being rewarded, it is not visible in their observable choices; their behavior remains consistent with a stance that rewards are others’ choices and not obligations to be acknowledged or repaid.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThe player observes large variations in others’ contributions, reward spending, and payoffs, including some peers who spend very heavily on rewards and others who give large contributions without receiving much reinforcement. Despite this, the focal player’s own behavior remains nearly unchanged. They do not mirror high contributors, retaliate against very low contributors via reduced cooperation, or adjust in response to others’ payoff swings. They also do not shift strategy after observing that some players sacrifice substantial payoff to reward particular targets, suggesting either indifference to those social dynamics or skepticism that engaging with them is profitable. Their lack of change in both contribution and reward behavior in the face of extreme pro-social or extreme costly rewarding by others indicates that they treat the game largely as an individual optimization task rather than as a social system to be shaped. They notice others’ actions in the sense that information is available, but their revealed preference is to ignore it in strategic terms. They therefore present as a payoff-focused, socially unresponsive type: they accept whatever group outcome emerges, take the redistributed benefits, and maintain their own pattern without trying to influence or integrate into the group’s emerging norms.", "umap_x": 1.9599169492721558, "umap_y": 0.39435136318206787, "cluster_id": 7, "cluster_size": 36, "cluster_title": "Reward / Contributions / High", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around reward, contributions, high, rewards, contribution."}

Contributions stay strictly above zero and span from very low to full endowment. The player starts with low contributions, then tests higher and even maximal giving, and later oscillates between low and medium amounts. This pattern indicates conditional cooperation rather than a fixed strategy: they are willing to increase contributions when the surrounding group appears relatively cooperative, but they do not maintain high contributions when the environment looks mixed or deteriorating. They seem to track others’ average behavior and adjust rather than blindly free-ride or consistently cooperate.\n\nThey do not adhere to a strict fairness norm of “matching the group average” or “proportional to others”; instead, they move their contribution up or down more coarsely, suggesting a simple heuristic like “when cooperation looks high or rising, try giving more; when it looks low or unstable, pull back.” They display some willingness to take on a large personal cost for the group by occasionally contributing very high amounts, which shows at least moderate prosociality and some tolerance for risk in pursuit of potential group gains. However, they also clearly value their own payoff and are not a pure altruist: in lower-contribution environments they revert to more self-serving contributions.\n\nOverall, the player’s contribution behavior fits a “cautious conditional cooperator with occasional exploratory generosity”: they cooperate, but do so in a way that appears sensitive to the recent cooperative climate and to their own payoff returns.\n\n<REWARD>\nThe player never spends any resources to reward others, despite having multiple opportunities and many instances where others contribute highly or reward extensively. This consistent non-use of reward suggests a strong reluctance to incur personal cost for social enforcement or gratitude signaling when the mechanism is exactly payoff-neutral (cost and benefit are equal). They appear to treat reward as strategically unnecessary or inefficient under these parameters.\n\nTheir inaction holds even when others’ prosocial behavior is striking or when many peers invest heavily in rewards. This indicates that they either (a) do not believe that rewarding will materially improve future cooperation enough to justify the expense, (b) place low value on expressing approval via monetary reward, or (c) see themselves as an observer/beneficiary rather than an active enforcer of norms. There is no evidence that they use reward to build alliances, anchor reciprocity, or shape the group’s contribution norms.\n\nIn type terms, they are a “non-rewarding conditional cooperator”: they are willing to adjust their own contribution to the group but are unwilling to pay to control others’ behavior or to thank them with costly signals.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThe player receives some reward from others but never reciprocates with reward of their own. They do not respond to being rewarded by changing their use of the reward mechanism (it remains unused) or by visibly forming a mutual-reward relationship. Any subsequent changes in their contributions do not systematically align with reward receipts, and there is no evidence that they selectively favor their rewarders via the mechanism.\n\nThis pattern points to weak or absent “direct reciprocity” through formal reward channels. The player may experience the rewards as a welcome bonus rather than a social obligation to be repaid. If they update behavior in response to reward at all, it is not through mirrored rewarding and is not clearly detectable here. Thus, as a type, they do not treat rewarders as partners to be actively supported; they behave more like a self-focused participant who appreciates extra income but does not shift strategy specifically to honor the source.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThe player clearly monitors others’ contributions and outcomes, as suggested by the way their own contributions move in step with broader shifts in group cooperation and visible extremes of behavior. They appear responsive to the overall contribution climate: when many players give generously and average contributions are high, they are willing to increase their own contribution from low to medium or high. When contributions become uneven, with many low or zero contributors alongside a few high ones, they cut back, implying sensitivity to perceived exploitation risk.\n\nThey also witness some players spending very large amounts on rewards and driving their own payoffs very low or even negative. The focal player does not imitate this, nor do they move toward moderate rewarding; instead, they continue to avoid using the reward mechanism entirely. This suggests they interpret heavy rewarding as either irrational, overly altruistic, or simply not a strategy they wish to emulate. They seem to prioritize stable, positive payoffs and avoid behaviors that visibly jeopardize individual earnings.\n\nIn social/personality terms, the player appears observant and adaptive but not norm-enforcing: they “read the room” and adjust their own contributions accordingly, while refusing to engage in costly social signaling. They respond to the distribution of others’ contributions and payoffs by tuning their cooperation level, but they do not step into the role of moralizer, leader, or coalition-builder through rewards. Their underlying orientation is pragmatic cooperation: contribute when it seems safe and moderately reciprocated by the group, preserve one’s own payoff when it does not, and treat others’ costly social actions as interesting background rather than as cues for personal reciprocation.", "umap_x": 2.0786242485046387, "umap_y": 0.7795261740684509, "cluster_id": 7, "cluster_size": 36, "cluster_title": "Reward / Contributions / High", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around reward, contributions, high, rewards, contribution."}

They almost always give a positive, mid-range amount, typically near or slightly above the emerging group average. They rarely exploit low-contributing environments by dropping to minimal contributions, but they also do not move to the very highest levels even when many others do so. Their behavior suggests a “conditional cooperator with a floor”: they appear willing to support the public good, but only within a band that maintains their own payoffs. Contribution levels adjust modestly in response to changes in group generosity, but not in a highly volatile or extreme way; they remain in a narrow range rather than oscillating between full free-riding and full cooperation. They show no clear evidence of applying strict fairness or matching rules toward specific others; their pattern fits more with reacting to the general contribution climate and guarding against being too far above it. Risk attitude toward cooperation seems moderate: they repeatedly invest in the public good even when others free-ride, but they do not “push” cooperation aggressively by moving to maximal contributions.\n\n<REWARD>\nThis player never spends any resources on rewarding others, despite having many opportunities and seeing others use reward mechanisms extensively. The consistent refusal to reward holds across situations with high and low contributions by others, including cases where some players invest large amounts in the public fund. Their stance indicates either a principled or strongly payoff-driven avoidance of costly reciprocity. They do not appear to use reward strategically (for example, to encourage high contributors, form alliances, or compensate generous behavior). There is no evidence that being rewarded themselves changes this stance; even after receiving substantial positive transfers, they refrain from rewarding anyone. Overall, they act as a pure non-rewarder who treats reward as an unnecessary or inefficient expense.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThis player is repeatedly rewarded by others, including episodes of very large positive transfers, yet they never respond with reciprocal rewards. They also do not visibly alter their own contribution pattern in a way that clearly favors those who rewarded them; their contributions remain in a similar mid-range band, without identifiable spikes that coincide with receiving help. This suggests they do not use the reward channel to signal gratitude, repay benefactors, or cement alliances. Their behavior is consistent with either viewing rewards as windfalls unconnected to future obligation, or with concentrating on their own payoff irrespective of social gestures. Their stance toward identifiable rewarders is behaviorally neutral: they neither repay them via reward nor distinguish them via notable changes in cooperative effort.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThis player observes extreme heterogeneity in others’ outcomes, including some players burning very large amounts on rewards and others free-riding or receiving large net gains, yet their own policy remains stable. They do not imitate costly prosocial rewarders nor retaliate against low contributors; they also do not shift drastically in response to others’ high earnings or losses. The pattern suggests they mentally separate their own strategy from others’ extremes: they continue contributing at modestly cooperative levels and ignore the reward mechanism as if it is strategically irrelevant to them.

They begin by giving most or all of their endowment, frequently choosing amounts near the maximum. They later experiment with much lower contributions, including complete free-riding, then return to substantial giving. This pattern suggests they care about the public good but are also willing to test how much they can personally gain while others continue to contribute.\n\nTheir behavior is conditional on group context: when many others contribute high amounts, they sometimes free-ride heavily, apparently trusting (or exploiting) the group’s cooperative baseline. When average contributions appear lower or more erratic, they move back toward higher giving, consistent with wanting the group to succeed or with adhering to an internal fairness or responsibility norm once group cooperation looks at risk.\n\nThey ignore the individually payoff-maximizing strategy of always contributing zero. Instead, they seem to balance self-interest with concern for the collective outcome, tolerating personal payoff losses when cooperating, but abandoning strict fairness: they do not systematically match others’ contributions, and they do not insist on proportional reciprocity. Their willingness to alternate between very high and zero contributions indicates moderate risk tolerance and experimentation: they appear to probe how sensitive the group outcome and their payoff are to their own level of cooperation. Overall, they fit a “conditional cooperator with opportunistic episodes” profile rather than a pure altruist or pure free-rider.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey never use the reward mechanism, despite the presence of generous rewarders and obvious opportunities to reinforce high contributors. This holds even when they receive small rewards themselves. Thus they appear strongly cost-averse regarding reward: they prioritize keeping their own payoff rather than spending to shape others’ behavior.\n\nThe absence of any rewarding, even in response to extreme generosity from others toward third parties, suggests they do not see reward as strategically valuable in this environment, or they place little intrinsic value on signaling approval or gratitude through costly actions. They neither engage in “upward rewarding” of very high contributors nor “network building” via mutual gift exchanges.\n\nGiven that rewarders are identifiable, refusing to reward also signals a preference not to participate in the emerging “reward culture” some others establish. This indicates a more individualistic or “quiet observer” stance: they let others bear the cost of incentivizing cooperation while they focus on their own contribution / payoff trade-offs.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThey receive modest rewards in several instances but never reciprocate toward any identifiable rewarder. There is no evidence of direct reciprocity (rewarding someone who previously rewarded them) or indirect reciprocity (rewarding others who generously reward third parties). This suggests that their cooperative behavior is not driven by a desire to build bilateral alliances through gift exchange.\n\nInstead, any gratitude they may feel is behaviorally inert: they do not translate being rewarded into concrete actions. Their subsequent choices do not show special protection of, or increased cooperation aimed at, known rewarders. They neither increase contributions specifically when pro-social rewarders stand to benefit, nor do they start rewarding those individuals back.\n\nThis indicates a type that decouples receiving kindness from paying it forward in the same currency.

Despite this, the focal player does not imitate, complement, or correct these behaviors via reward. Their response is mainly through adjustments to their own contribution level.\n\nWhen they see that very high contributions by others can sustain the public good without their own input, they sometimes shift sharply toward free-riding, capturing large private payoffs while others’ round payoffs fall or become highly uneven. Conversely, after sequences where average cooperation looks weaker or more unstable, they move back toward substantial contributions, which helps stabilize group outcomes. This pattern implies that they are responsive to the overall cooperation climate but not to individuals’ specific payoffs or costs.\n\nThey ignore conspicuous “moral crusaders” who spend heavily on rewards: they do not join them, sanction them, or modify contribution to favor them.

This pattern suggests they prioritize maximizing their own payoff over sustaining the public good.\n\nThey do not appear to condition their contributions positively on others’ cooperation: they continue to contribute nothing even when others contribute highly and the public fund is large, and they only make small contributions when free-riding has already been established as common in the group. Their contribution decisions do not track clear fairness norms; they seem comfortable taking a disproportionate share of the benefits generated by others’ contributions. There is no visible concern for risk to group cooperation in the long term, likely because they either discount future rounds or do not strongly believe that their own contribution is needed to maintain the group’s giving.\n\nOverall, their contribution profile fits an “opportunistic low contributor” type: they are willing to give a little when it is cheap and/or when it may help them blend in, but their default is to keep their entire endowment.\n\n<REWARD>\nThis player never spends any coins on rewarding others, even in settings where others are contributing a lot or where some players are clearly using rewards to encourage cooperation.

Their stance suggests they either see the reward mechanism as irrelevant to their own objectives, or they explicitly treat it as a dominated action given the 1:1 private cost-to-benefit ratio at the individual level.

This points to a player who is exploratory and somewhat risk-tolerant with respect to personal payoff, using contributions as a lever to test group behavior and the effectiveness of reward dynamics more than to stick to a predetermined “fair share.”\n\nOverall, they fit a “conditional experimental cooperator”: they care about cooperation but are willing to deviate in either direction while they learn how the group and the reward system behave.\n\n<REWARD>\nThis player uses reward sparingly and selectively. Across the game they sometimes pay to reward others but never at large scales, and they do not mirror the extreme “altruistic rewarder” types present in the group. When they do reward, recipients tend to be players who are visibly cooperative or who have played a salient role in sustaining contributions. The pattern suggests they are trying to reinforce pro-social behavior rather than randomly gifting or forming arbitrary alliances.\n\nThey are also willing to reward in rounds where they themselves contribute very highly and get relatively modest payoffs, indicating that they accept a personal cost to encourage what they perceive as helpful behavior. However, the magnitude of their rewards remains small compared with what some others spend. This implies that while they value using rewards as a signal and incentive, they also monitor costs carefully and avoid full self-sacrifice.\n\nThere is no evidence that they use reward as direct tit-for-tat with any single player; instead, the timing and small scale point to a strategic but cautious use of positive incentives to nudge overall cooperation and to acknowledge particularly cooperative acts.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThe player receives small amounts of reward on a few occasions, from different sources, but their own reward behavior does not show clear, targeted reciprocity toward those specific individuals. They neither escalate into mutual reward cycles nor dramatically change their contributions immediately after being rewarded.\n\nTheir reaction is best characterized as appreciative but not personally bound: being rewarded does not visibly lock them into a loyalty relationship with any particular benefactor. They treat rewards more as general feedback that cooperation is noticed than as a cue to form exclusive alliances. There is no evidence of retaliatory withdrawal toward rewarders either; they simply maintain their own exploratory contribution and limited reward strategy.\n\nThus, they display weak or diffuse reciprocity: they may internalize that “the group values cooperation,” but they do not convert identifiable rewarders into privileged partners in a systematic way.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThis player pays close implicit attention to how others’ coins and reward spending play out. Their contribution and reward decisions vary in ways that align with visible shifts in how costly cooperation and rewarding become for different group members. They witness both extreme reward spending by some players and stable free-riding or low spending by others, yet they avoid both extremes.\n\nThey do not imitate the very heavy rewarders who sacrifice large portions of their payoff; instead, they continue to use moderate contributions and small-scale rewards, suggesting they perceive excessive spending as unsustainable or irrational. At the same time, they do not react by dropping into pure free-riding when others appear to overspend or when cooperative peers are not always rewarded sufficiently. This indicates a tolerance for inequality and noise in payoffs: they are willing to coexist with big disparities in earnings and in reward costs without making sharp retaliatory moves.\n\nOverall, they interpret others’ outcomes as informative but not binding. They update their own behavior gradually and experimentally rather than in abrupt, punitive or imitative jumps. This points to a type who learns from the environment, aims for a balance between cooperation and self-interest, and remains relatively calm in the face of both exploitation and over-generosity.", "umap_x": 1.925572156906128, "umap_y": 0.7198297381401062, "cluster_id": 7, "cluster_size": 36, "cluster_title": "Reward / Contributions / High", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around reward, contributions, high, rewards, contribution."}

They start below the group average but quickly move into consistently above-average contributions, often at or near full endowment. They occasionally drop to moderate levels, suggesting they are not rigidly unconditional; however, even their “low” contributions remain substantial rather than exploitative. Their behavior indicates a strong pro-social or cooperative orientation despite the low marginal per-capita return: they repeatedly choose socially efficient but individually costly contributions.\n\nTheir adjustments track broad cooperation levels but not in a finely contingent, tit-for-tat manner. They do not systematically match the contributions of specific others or the exact group average; instead they appear to adopt a “high baseline cooperation with occasional moderation” rule. This points to an internal fairness or responsibility norm (“I should give a lot”) more than a payoff-maximizing calculation. They tolerate being among the highest contributors even when others contribute little, indicating low sensitivity to being exploited and high willingness to carry the public good.\n\nRisk-wise, they accept repeated low personal payoffs, including extreme sacrifice when combining high contribution and heavy reward spending. This shows high risk tolerance and low short-term self-protection in favor of maintaining or signaling cooperation.\n\n<REWARD>\nThe player is an extremely active and generous rewarder in the first two-thirds of the game, then sharply curtails rewarding later. They frequently spend substantial portions of their payoff on rewards, even when that makes them one of the lowest earners. Their rewards are directed broadly rather than narrowly targeted to a single “partner,” and they favor players who contribute meaningfully rather than obvious free-riders. They also show willingness to reward both mid-level and high contributors, suggesting a norm-affirming rather than strictly selective strategy.\n\nGiven that the reward technology is efficiency-neutral, their heavy use of it is not irrational, but the scale and persistence of their spending reveal a strong preference for reinforcing cooperation, even at high variance in personal outcome. They are not purely strategic in the narrow sense: they continue to reward generously even after it is clear that others are not matching their sacrifice level in rewards or contributions. Over time, however, they shift toward zero reward usage, indicating some learning or fatigue—possibly concluding that their heavy rewarding does not significantly reshape group behavior.\n\nOverall, they act as a “rewarding altruist” or “moral investor,” using rewards to endorse and encourage cooperation more than to form tight dyadic alliances.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThe player receives very little reward across the game and only modestly later on. They do not reliably repay those who reward them; there is no clear emergence of reciprocating pairs. Their own reward pattern does not pivot toward those who have rewarded them, nor do they maintain high rewards to such players once they reduce rewarding overall. This suggests low emphasis on direct reciprocity and alliance-building.\n\nInstead, their response to being rewarded is muted in behavior: their contribution path remains high whether or not they are personally recognized, and their decision to wind down rewarding appears more tied to the perceived ineffectiveness or cost of rewards in general, not to disappointment with specific rewarders. They seem to treat reward receipt as pleasant but non-central information, not as a binding social contract.\n\nThis pattern fits a type who values general cooperative norms more than personal loyalty cycles. They do not punish non-rewarders by withdrawing cooperation or targeting rewards away from them; they simply reduce reward expenditures globally once it appears costly and weakly impactful.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThe player is attentive to others’ outcomes and reacts to the broad structure of payoffs and reward usage rather than micro-managing pairwise relations. They repeatedly observe situations where heavy rewarders or heavy contributors end up with very low or even negative net payoffs, while non-rewarding, sometimes low-contributing players earn high returns. Despite seeing this, they persist for many rounds as a high contributor and heavy rewarder, signaling that they prioritize sustaining or modeling cooperation over protecting themselves against relative losses.\n\nThey appear somewhat responsive to extreme anomalies: massive, possibly erratic reward sprees by certain others do not induce them to join in similar extremes, and after observing that reward-heavy rounds leave rewarders very poor while many others free-ride on their generosity, they progressively withdraw from using rewards. However, they do not respond with retaliatory under-contribution or targeted exclusion; instead, they maintain substantial contributions while trimming the most personally costly, low-leverage behavior (the heavy rewards). This indicates a learning process focused on cost control rather than on revenge or status competition.\n\nOverall, they interpret others’ payoffs and spending as signals about the effectiveness and sustainability of cooperation mechanisms, not as direct prompts for punishment or alliance. They remain cooperative even when cooperation is not strongly reciprocated, but they do eventually moderate their “pro-social spending” once it is clear that others’ strategies leave them chronically underpaid.", "umap_x": 1.6139479875564575, "umap_y": 0.5635974407196045, "cluster_id": 7, "cluster_size": 36, "cluster_title": "Reward / Contributions / High", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around reward, contributions, high, rewards, contribution."}

They are willing to make very high contributions but do not maintain them consistently, and they freely switch between full cooperation and full free-riding. They alternate between giving their entire endowment, half of it, or nothing, without settling into a stable pattern. Their behavior does not track simple conditional cooperation rules such as clearly matching group averages or selectively rewarding high contributors with their own behavior. They sometimes contribute fully when others are contributing moderately, and sometimes contribute nothing when others are contributing heavily. This suggests low adherence to strong fairness norms or consistent efficiency-maximizing principles, and a greater focus on experimenting with payoff structures and taking advantage of high-contribution environments when it is cheap to free-ride. They appear comfortable with substantial payoff variance: they accept low immediate payoffs when contributing fully and no rewards, and later accept very high payoffs when free-riding in cooperative environments. Overall, they show limited concern for aligning their own contributions with others’ efforts and appear relatively insensitive to specific individual contribution levels. Their pattern indicates medium to high risk tolerance in terms of payoff swings and a willingness to “test” both extremes of the strategy space (full cooperator vs. full defector) over time.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey never spend any coins to reward others, despite frequent and often large reward activity in the group. This holds across situations where many others make very high contributions and where particular individuals are repeatedly using reward at significant personal cost. Their zero use of the reward mechanism suggests either they do not value reward as a coordination or reciprocity tool, or they view its cost as unjustified regardless of others’ behavior. They do receive nontrivial rewards from others in multiple instances, yet still do not reciprocate or use reward strategically to encourage cooperation. There is no evidence that they selectively reward high contributors, consistent allies, or generous rewarders; the mechanism is simply unused. This points to a “reward-averse” or “reward-indifferent” orientation: they take any incoming benefits but do not invest in the prosocial infrastructure themselves. If they have a strategy regarding reward, it is a purely passive one—treat rewards as windfalls rather than as a signal to be reinforced.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThey receive rewards in several rounds from different peers, including when they are contributing fully and when they are free-riding. Despite this, they never respond with reciprocal rewards, and they do not visibly adjust their contribution behavior in a way that favors those who rewarded them. When rewarded after cooperative behavior, they do not become consistently more cooperative; when rewarded while free-riding, they do not show signs of guilt-driven correction or loyalty formation. Because rewarders’ identities are visible, their lack of targeted reciprocation suggests that they do not use reward as a basis for alliance formation or reputational exchange. Their stance toward rewarders appears to be “quietly exploitative” or at least strongly self-regarding: they accept the benefits but do not treat them as obligations or signals requiring a response. Their social reciprocity, at least via the available monetary channels, is effectively absent.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey observe a group with highly heterogeneous behavior: some players repeatedly spend heavily to reward others, sometimes to the point of drastically reducing their own payoffs, while others contribute a lot or very little. The focal player’s pattern indicates that they are largely unmoved by these extreme prosocial expenditures. They do not mirror the generous rewarders, nor do they moderate their own strategy to protect or support highly cooperative individuals whose payoffs are reduced by reward costs. Instead, they appear to situationally exploit environments where others are contributing heavily and rewarding freely, by occasionally switching to zero contribution while still enjoying high redistribution and incoming rewards. Their contributions do not systematically rise in response to others’ high costs or fall in response to visible stinginess; their actions remain loosely coupled to the observed payoff distribution. This suggests limited empathic or fairness-based response to others’ outcomes and a focus on their own payoff opportunities. Learning and adaptation are present only in a coarse sense: they realize that both high contribution and zero contribution can coexist with acceptable or even high payoffs, and they cycle between them, but they do not refine this into a more nuanced conditional strategy based on who is bearing which costs.

They tolerate substantial inequality in who contributes what and do not consistently withdraw cooperation in direct response to low contributors being present. Instead, they seem to trade off between (a) exploring payoff‑maximizing behavior when they see that free riding yields high returns and (b) occasionally “testing” high contributions, possibly to see if the group will sustain a more cooperative norm, or because they value the idea of contributing in principle.  \n\nThey do not show a clear fairness norm (such as closely tracking high vs. low contributors and aligning their own behavior accordingly). They appear comfortable both over‑contributing relative to many others and also under‑contributing while others invest heavily. This points to relatively low aversion to payoff inequality. Risk tolerance is moderate to high: they are willing to risk low payoffs by contributing a lot even in an environment where many others have previously free ridden, and they are also willing to risk future social disapproval by free riding when others are generous. Overall, they act as an opportunistic, experimental conditional cooperator whose behavior is shaped more by individual payoff considerations than by strict fairness or consistency.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey almost never use the reward mechanism, despite having multiple opportunities and clear examples of other players spending heavily to reward. When they do spend on reward, they do so only minimally and with no obvious pattern of strongly reinforcing high cooperators. There is no consistent targeting of the highest contributors, nor of any specific partner over time. This indicates a low intrinsic motivation to reward others and weak interest in shaping group norms through positive incentives.  \n\nTheir rare rewards do not appear to be a direct “thanks” for being rewarded themselves, nor part of a sustained strategic alliance. Instead, rewarding seems incidental or experimental: they test the mechanism once or twice but quickly revert to not using it, even when high contributors exist or when some players spend large amounts rewarding others. They therefore do not behave like a reciprocity‑driven rewarder, a norm enforcer, or a coalition‑builder via reward. Rather, they implicitly treat reward as personally costly and of limited strategic value, preferring to keep coins or use them via contribution choices.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThey receive very little direct reward, and when they do, they do not respond with visible reciprocal reward back to the same individual, nor with a clear change in their contribution that can be tied uniquely to that benefactor. This suggests that they do not use reward as a basis for bilateral alliance building or direct reciprocity.  \n\nBecause they do not systematically “pay back” those who reward them, they behave as if gratitude, in the sense of material reciprocity, is weak or subordinated to their own payoff calculus. They may appreciate being rewarded on some level (unknown), but behaviorally they do not commit resources to acknowledge or reinforce that kindness. Their strategy thus does not hinge on building long‑term dyadic relationships; instead, they treat reward they receive as a windfall rather than as an obligation‑creating signal.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey observe large and sometimes extreme uses of the reward mechanism by others (including players who sacrifice substantial payoffs to reward certain targets), yet they do not imitate this behavior or systematically adjust their contributions in line with it. Their contribution path does not track the fortunes of rewarded players or the costs borne by rewarders in a consistent way. This suggests that they are relatively unmoved by others’ sacrifices or windfalls as social signals.  \n\nThey do, however, appear to notice broad payoff patterns in the group: they are willing to free ride when it is clearly profitable, and they later return to high contributions even after seeing that some players earn much more by contributing little.

Instead, they treat the group’s behavior and payoff profile as a shifting environment to exploit or occasionally test with cooperative play.  \n\nIn personality terms, they come across as pragmatic, low‑expressive, and individually oriented rather than strongly prosocial or strongly vindictive. They neither join in the heavy rewarding “moralists” nor consistently anchor on the high‑earning free riders.

Occasional spikes to moderate or high contributions occur without a stable link to others’ average behavior or to changes in the group’s cooperation level. The player does not appear to follow a fairness norm such as “match the group average” or “reward high contributors by also contributing more.” Instead, contribution choices suggest either experimentation with different levels or opportunistic giving when it feels low-risk, but not a sustained commitment to group welfare. They tolerate exploiting cooperative others: they frequently free-ride while many peers contribute substantial amounts. There is no evidence of strong aversion to benefiting from others’ generosity. Risk tolerance toward the public good appears low: once they see that they can earn solid payoffs with low or zero contributions, they revert to that pattern rather than investing into the common pool to try to shift group behavior.\n\n<REWARD>\nThe player never spends on rewards. This holds even when they receive significant free benefits from generous contributors, and even when some peers incur large costs to reward others. They do not use rewards instrumentally to encourage high cooperators, nor do they use them expressively to signal gratitude or group affiliation. The presence of very heavy rewarders in the group does not draw them into the reward system; they remain a pure non-rewarder. This suggests that, for this player, the cost of rewarding is not justified by any expected strategic gain, and that warm-glow or reciprocity motives via the reward channel are weak or absent.

Overall, they act as a passive beneficiary: they accept rewards when given but do not form observable alliances, do not “pay back” particular helpers, and do not imitate rewarders’ generosity.

They appear insensitive to social pressure: observing generous or stable contributors does not induce even a small “token” contribution. There is no sign of conditional cooperation, threshold behavior, or risk-taking in the direction of contributing; instead, they rely entirely on others to fund the public good and accept the resulting high benefits.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey never spend on reward, even when the mechanism is active and others heavily use it. This indicates strong reluctance to incur any personal cost for social reinforcement, whether to encourage high contributors or to thank those who reward them. Their stance is consistently non-participatory in the reward phase: they do not attempt to steer group behavior, build goodwill, or reciprocate gifts via the available mechanism. This is compatible with a strictly self-regarding payoff focus: since reward here is cost-neutral in expectation, they treat it as useless or not worth the cognitive/effort cost.

They do not appear guided by a strict fairness norm such as “match average,” “reward high contributors,” or “never give more than others”; instead, they alternate between partial cooperation and outright free-riding, seemingly testing how much they can take while still benefiting from others’ generosity. Their willingness to occasionally contribute a lot, including once giving their entire endowment, suggests they are not purely risk-averse or purely selfish; they are willing to sacrifice payoff at times, but this does not crystallize into a stable high-cooperation strategy. Overall, they prioritize maintaining good payoffs for themselves and show no clear effort to stabilize group cooperation.\n\n<REWARD>\nThe player never uses the reward mechanism across all observed opportunities. This holds even when they themselves receive positive rewards and can see others using rewards intensively. They therefore do not engage in strategic reinforcement of high contributors, do not repay kindness with reward, and do not expend resources to guide others’ behavior. This pattern indicates a strong aversion to paying personal costs for others’ benefit, even at minimal or equal efficiency. It also suggests they do not view rewards as a tool for influencing future cooperation or building alliances; any social motives they may have do not translate into action in this institution. Their stance is consistent and unidirectional: they are a non-rewarder by type in this setting.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nWhen they receive rewards, they do not change their reward behavior toward the giver (or toward anyone else), nor do they start rewarding after being targeted. They also do not use contributions to signal gratitude or alliance in any obvious way after being rewarded; their contribution pattern continues to fluctuate in both cooperative and free-riding directions without an identifiable “thank you” response. In a context where rewarders are identifiable, they still abstain from reciprocating. This suggests low propensity for direct reciprocity via institutional tools and little inclination to build bilateral cooperative relationships through costly actions.

They consistently keep their entire endowment rather than contributing to the public fund, with only one exception where they contribute a moderate amount once and then immediately revert to zero. Their default is to treat the public good as something others will provide. This pattern is stable over time and does not track changes in group contribution levels; they do not appear to condition their own contribution on others’ generosity, nor to respond to declines in group cooperation with “matching” behavior. Any concern for efficiency or group welfare is not expressed through direct contribution. Fairness norms about proportional giving are either weak or absent in their revealed behavior. Their risk tolerance around contribution appears low: they avoid paying into the public fund even when many others are clearly cooperating and even when their own past payoff is high enough to “afford” some giving. Overall, they behave as a self-focused, strategically detached contributor who prefers to influence the game, if at all, via the reward stage rather than via their own contributions.\n\n<REWARD>\nThis player is extremely active and erratic in the reward stage, at times spending very large amounts on rewards and at other times spending nothing. They are clearly willing to incur substantial personal cost to grant rewards, even to the point of pushing their own payoff into strongly negative territory in a given period. This indicates that they do not treat the reward mechanism purely instrumentally for near-term material payoff; non-monetary motives (e.g., expressive behavior, experiments with influence, or strong but shifting preferences about particular others) seem to dominate.\n\nTheir targeting is highly selective rather than diffuse. In several instances they concentrate rewards heavily on a single individual, drastically boosting that person’s payoff while sacrificing a large share of their own. At other times they distribute rewards among a small handful of peers, and in other periods they stop rewarding entirely. There is no clear monotonic relationship between others’ contribution levels and being rewarded by this player: some high contributors receive large transfers, others receive none, and some relatively low or zero contributors at times benefit. This suggests that their reward rule is not a simple “reward cooperators” heuristic. Instead, they may be responding to a combination of idiosyncratic criteria: possibly prior interactions, perceived neglect by others, or a desire to “correct” payoff rankings by elevating particular individuals. The fact that they both give and receive reward but do not establish stable reciprocal patterns suggests they are not strategically building long-term alliances in a consistent way.\n\nThey do not use rewards in a tightly payoff-maximizing way: they sometimes spend so much that their own payoff is well below what they could have kept simply by not rewarding at all. This indicates a willingness to trade off personal earnings for other objectives, but those objectives are not transparently cooperative; they do not persistently reinforce high contributors or systematically discourage free riding. Overall, their reward behavior is best characterized as high-cost, highly selective, and unstable in direction, driven by their own shifting priorities rather than by a consistent social norm.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThis player is intermittently rewarded by others, yet they do not develop any clear pattern of direct reciprocity toward those who reward them. When they are the recipient of reward, they do not reliably channel subsequent reward back to those same individuals, nor do they consistently increase their own contribution in response. Any reciprocity that might exist is weak or noisy rather than systematic.\n\nTheir use of rewards toward others appears largely decoupled from the identity of prior rewarders. At some points they spend heavily on players who have not recently rewarded them, and at other points they ignore players who have been generous toward them. This makes it unlikely that they are consciously pursuing reputation-based alliances or tit-for-tat style exchange of favors. If they register being rewarded at all, their behavioral adjustment is subtle or overshadowed by other motives. From the data alone, it is unknown whether they feel gratitude or perceive signaling value in the rewards they receive; what is clear is that those internal states, if present, rarely translate into systematic, targeted reciprocity in subsequent decisions.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThis player pays close enough attention to others’ outcomes to direct large, focused transfers, but they do not respond in a straightforward, norm-enforcing way to payoff distributions. They sometimes dramatically inflate the payoff of a particular peer, even when that peer is already doing reasonably well, and at other times they do not intervene to assist individuals with relatively low earnings. Their behavior cannot be reduced to a simple aversion to inequality, because they sometimes strongly increase inequality by elevating one player far above the rest while accepting a large personal loss.\n\nThey also do not appear to punish low contributors indirectly by withholding reward in a systematic fashion; many low or zero contributors simply receive no attention from them, while some get boosted. Their response to others’ high spending on rewards is similarly inconsistent: they do not reliably “support the supporter” or coordinate with other big rewarders, nor do they clearly avoid or counter them. It is more accurate to say that they use the information about others’ contributions, reward spending, and resulting payoffs as a menu from which to make idiosyncratic, sometimes extreme interventions, rather than as cues for enforcing a clear social norm.\n\nIn personality terms, they present as unconventional, willing to incur large personal costs to shape the payoff landscape according to their own shifting preferences. They do not try to lead via contribution or via consistent norm enforcement; instead, they occasionally make dramatic moves in the reward phase that reallocate earnings, without visibly stabilizing into a cooperative “type.” Their learning and adaptation are limited: despite feedback about the effects of their actions, they revert repeatedly to full free riding on contributions and oscillate between heavy and zero reward use, suggesting exploratory or expressive behavior rather than a convergent strategy.", "umap_x": 1.87160325050354, "umap_y": 0.8150549530982971, "cluster_id": 7, "cluster_size": 36, "cluster_title": "Reward / Contributions / High", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around reward, contributions, high, rewards, contribution."}

They start by always contributing their entire endowment regardless of how much others give, even when average contributions are low and trending downward. This indicates a strong initial norm of full cooperation and willingness to incur substantial relative losses for the group.\n\nThey maintain that pattern for most of the game, despite consistently earning less than many lower contributors. Only late in the game do they sharply reduce their giving, first to pure free-riding and then to a low, partial contribution. This shift suggests they update based on accumulated experience of being exploited or seeing inadequate group cooperation, rather than responding myopically to one-off deviations.\n\nTheir adjustment is abrupt rather than gradual, implying that they tolerate unfairness for some time and then flip into a more self-protective mode. They do not appear to condition finely on specific individuals’ behavior; instead, they react to the overall environment and their own payoff experience. Risk tolerance is high in the cooperative direction: they repeatedly choose the individually dominated, high-contribution action even when it is clearly not reciprocated by the group.\n\nFairness norms seem group-focused rather than dyadic: they aim for high public good provision, absorbing inequality rather than correcting it. Only near the end do they partially abandon that stance and allow themselves to benefit materially relative to the group.\n\n<REWARD>\nThis player never uses the reward mechanism despite having multiple opportunities and clear examples of others rewarding cooperators. They are willing to accept net payoff losses from high contribution, but they are not willing to incur the separate, additional personal costs needed to reinforce others via rewards.\n\nTheir non-use spans situations where others contribute very highly, where they themselves receive reward, and where reward is used extensively by others. This pattern suggests either that they do not see marginal benefit in spending further to influence behavior, or that they are unfamiliar or uncomfortable with using targeted incentives, or that they view the cost of reward as wasteful even while being generous in contribution.\n\nBecause they never reward, they do not appear to use reward strategically for alliance building, reciprocity, or signaling approval. They behave more like a “pure cooperator” in the contribution stage and a “non-participant” in the incentive stage. The fact that they persistently refrain from rewarding, even after receiving reward, suggests that gratitude does not translate into active reciprocity through the mechanism, at least under this cost/benefit structure.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThey receive reward in several rounds from at least some group members. Despite this, they never respond by rewarding those individuals back or by otherwise engaging in targeted reciprocal behavior. They continue their own contribution pattern largely independent of who rewards them. When their contributions remain high, it is because they already choose to be a full cooperator, not because reward changes their action.\n\nThey therefore do not build explicit alliances or coalitions with rewarders. If they feel gratitude, it does not manifest in observable, strategic reciprocity within the reward stage. Their behavior suggests that they interpret reward, at most, as a welcome bonus or as confirmation of their cooperative identity, not as a cue to engage in tit-for-tat or partner selection. They do not differentiate between rewarders and non-rewarders in any detectable way.\n\nOverall, their response to being rewarded is passive: they accept it but do not change their own incentive use, and only very late do they change contribution in ways that are not clearly linked to reward patterns. There is no evidence of targeted revenge or reward cycles, so alliance-building and direct reciprocity are weak or absent in their type.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThis player closely observes an environment where others’ payoffs and reward costs vary dramatically, including episodes of extreme over-reward by some participants and persistent moderate to low contributions by many. Despite seeing some players sacrifice heavily through reward while others free-ride and earn high payoffs, they do not mimic either extreme. They avoid costly reward behavior entirely, and only gradually respond to low contributions and free-riding by adjusting their own giving late in the game.\n\nTheir early behavior indicates they initially discount relative payoff disadvantages and continue contributing fully even while others who give less earn more. This suggests a high tolerance for inequality when it arises from differing contribution levels, or a strong internal rule to “do the cooperative thing” regardless of payoffs. Over time, however, repeated exposure to low group contributions and inconsistent pro-social incentives coincides with a shift to self-interested choices, first as a full free-rider and then as a modest contributor. This transition implies learning that others’ outcomes and behaviors are not reliably cooperative, and a resulting willingness to protect their own payoff.\n\nThey do not react in a differentiated way to spectacularly large reward costs or windfall payoffs for others; these events do not trigger imitation of reward strategies or special treatment of highly rewarded players. Instead, they seem to treat others’ outcomes as aggregate signals about the group’s cooperativeness rather than opportunities for targeted response. Personality-wise, they appear principled but somewhat detached from active social engineering: initially idealistic about group cooperation, patient with exploitation, and eventually pragmatically self-protective once the environment repeatedly fails to meet their cooperative expectations.", "umap_x": 1.8667500019073486, "umap_y": 0.7513062357902527, "cluster_id": 7, "cluster_size": 36, "cluster_title": "Reward / Contributions / High", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around reward, contributions, high, rewards, contribution."}

They sometimes contribute the full endowment, sometimes free‑ride completely, and otherwise hover around low-to-medium contributions. They are clearly not committed to any fixed fairness norm such as always matching the group average or always contributing high. Instead, they appear to explore extremes (full cooperation vs. full free‑riding) and then settle into middling contributions later.\n\nThey do not visibly reward or match other players’ contribution levels directly; their contributions do not systematically track who is generous or stingy in the group. They seem more focused on their own payoff opportunities than on enforcing norms. When the environment looks “chaotic” (very high variance in others’ contributions and reward spending), they do not take on a stabilizing role and instead shift between high and low contributions in a way that suggests experimentation and opportunism rather than principled fairness.\n\nRisk tolerance appears moderate: they are willing to fully cooperate or fully free‑ride at different points, but they avoid extreme, consistent sacrifice. They show no perseverance in sustaining high contributions once it is clear that others are not reliably cooperative. Overall, they behave like a self-interested learner who is willing to contribute when it seems compatible with good payoffs but quickly adjusts downward when high contributions do not clearly pay off.\n\n<REWARD>\nThis player never spends any coins on rewards, despite many others engaging heavily in rewarding and sometimes incurring large costs. Their trigger for rewarding appears effectively absent: they do not pay to reward high contributors, they do not reciprocate direct rewards they receive, and they do not use rewards as a strategic tool to shape others’ behavior.\n\nThis strongly suggests that they treat the reward mechanism as individually unprofitable or irrelevant, even though it is cost-neutral at the pairwise level. They seem to ignore potential long‑term benefits of reputation-building through reward and instead focus narrowly on immediate payoffs. There is no evidence that they use “selective rewarding” to encourage specific partners or patterns; they simply opt out of the reward stage entirely.\n\nGiven this, their willingness to invest in social capital or indirect reciprocity via rewards is essentially zero. They appear to hold either the belief that others will reward regardless of their own rewarding, or that the reward system is too noisy or costly in practice to bother exploiting.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThey receive rewards in multiple rounds from various others, sometimes at nontrivial cost to those others, but they never respond with any reward back to those specific individuals or to the group more generally. Their subsequent contributions do not show an obvious jump that could be interpreted as “gratitude-induced” cooperation after being rewarded; instead, their contributions continue to fluctuate according to their own payoff considerations.\n\nThis pattern indicates an absence of direct reciprocity toward identifiable rewarders. They do not appear to form alliances, return favors, or establish “reward clubs.” In terms of social signaling, they accept benefits but give no visible acknowledgment through either extra contributions or outgoing rewards.\n\nPersonality-wise (as inferred from behavior), this points toward a predominantly self-regarding stance: they do not internalize rewards as obligations and do not act to maintain reciprocal ties. If anything, they might interpret received rewards as free gains rather than as part of a relational exchange that needs to be honored.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey observe substantial heterogeneity in others’ outcomes: some players burn large amounts of coins to reward others, some receive big boosts, and some stay quiet and accumulate payoffs. Across all this, the focal player does not react by changing their own reward behavior (which stays at zero throughout). Nor do they consistently reward high contributors or punish low contributors via reduced contributions targeted at particular individuals; their own contributions fluctuate without clear alignment to who is being heavily rewarded or who is sacrificing most.\n\nWhen others incur large costs to reward or to support certain players, the focal player does not step in to share that cost or to “join the coalition” of rewarders. They do not seem impressed or intimidated by others’ extreme prosociality. Similarly, when some players repeatedly free‑ride or contribute minimally while still getting good payoffs, there is no visible backlash from the focal player in the form of increased contributions to counterbalance, nor any attempt to counter free‑riding through reward strategies.\n\nOverall, they treat the outcome landscape as information mainly about payoff possibilities, not as a moral or relational signal demanding a response. Others’ high costs, large rewards, or losses do not induce them to change their basic pattern of play: opportunistic, moderately cooperative when convenient, unwilling to pay for social enforcement. Their “type” is thus best characterized as a payoff-focused conditional cooperator who ignores the reward institution and does not engage in reciprocity, coalition building, or norm enforcement, despite clear evidence that others are doing so.", "umap_x": 1.9950549602508545, "umap_y": 0.6317365765571594, "cluster_id": 7, "cluster_size": 36, "cluster_title": "Reward / Contributions / High", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around reward, contributions, high, rewards, contribution."}

They sometimes contribute nothing despite many others contributing substantially, indicating a willingness to exploit the public fund when others are generous. They also occasionally contribute the maximum or near-maximum, but this does not establish a stable cooperative pattern; instead, these high contributions appear sporadic and not contingent on clear thresholds of others’ behavior. There is no evidence that they systematically match others’ contributions or try to move the group toward an efficient cooperative equilibrium. They show no clear fairness norm: they are comfortable taking a full free-rider position even when others contribute a lot, and they do not consistently continue high contributions after group cooperation improves. Risk tolerance appears moderate: they sometimes make large contributions that leave them relatively low in that round’s payoff, but they also often revert to low or zero contributions to secure high personal earnings when others carry the public fund.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey never spend any resources on reward in any observed instance, despite multiple opportunities where some peers incur substantial costs to reward others and where high cooperators are visible. This suggests a strong reluctance to incur any personal cost to shape others’ behavior via positive incentives. They do not use reward strategically, either to encourage high contributors, to reciprocate, or to build coalitions. Their behavior fits a “pure consumer” of the reward environment: willing to accept rewards but never to fund them. This strongly indicates low intrinsic preference for altruistic rewarding and a narrow focus on personal payoff maximization in the reward stage. There is no sign they experiment with even minimal, symbolic rewards; the threshold to spend is effectively infinite for them.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThey receive rewards from others on some occasions, but they never reciprocate to those rewarders in later reward stages, nor do they shift their contribution pattern in a way that clearly rewards or supports those individuals. This points to an absence of positive reciprocity toward identifiable benefactors. Their later decisions do not show targeted generosity toward those who previously rewarded them. Socially, they behave as a one-way beneficiary: they accept rewards as windfalls without treating them as the start of an alliance or a relationship. Their type is therefore non-relational in this environment; they do not convert being rewarded into obligations, gratitude signals, or strategic cooperation.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey observe rich variation in others’ outcomes, including very costly reward behavior by some players and repeated high contributions by others, yet they remain behaviorally detached. Large reward expenditures by some participants, and the substantial payoff sacrifices those players incur, do not trigger any visible response in either their contribution level or their reward decisions. They also witness certain players repeatedly ending rounds with very high or very low payoffs due to their reward activity, but they neither emulate nor support those patterns. Their own strategy appears insensitive to these social signals: they treat others’ costs and payoffs primarily as background information rather than cues for norm enforcement or coordination. This suggests they believe others’ prosocial or extreme behaviors are not worth responding to; they prioritize stable personal gain over engaging with apparent norms, generosity, or attempts at group structuring by others. Overall, they function as an adaptive egoist: attentive enough to exploit a cooperative environment when it suits them, but not motivated to modify their behavior in response to others’ sacrifices or outcomes.", "umap_x": 1.6832242012023926, "umap_y": 0.2391611486673355, "cluster_id": 7, "cluster_size": 36, "cluster_title": "Reward / Contributions / High", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around reward, contributions, high, rewards, contribution."}

They always contribute their entire endowment, with no variation across the game. Their behavior is non-conditional: cooperation does not appear to depend on others’ behavior, even though others also always fully cooperate. They follow a strong efficiency norm: they consistently choose the welfare-maximizing option rather than the individual payoff–maximizing option. There is no evidence of strategic hedging, experimentation, or risk adjustment; they do not test partial defection, even early or late in the game. This pattern is consistent with a stable “principled cooperator” type rather than a conditional or opportunistic cooperator. Fairness seems defined as equal, full contribution by all, which they both experience and maintain. Whether this norm would hold if others defected is unknown.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThey do not send any chat messages and do not respond to the one visible message from a peer. This indicates a strongly non-communicative or passive communication style in this context. They neither attempt to coordinate, persuade, nor clarify rules socially; instead, they rely entirely on the formal structure of the game. There is no evidence of socio-emotional signaling (no thanks, reassurance, or norm talk). Their silence, despite a smoothly cooperative environment, suggests they see communication as unnecessary for sustaining cooperation here, or they simply prefer to avoid social engagement. Their responsiveness to others’ messages is effectively zero, so their tone and persuasive tendencies remain unknown.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nTheir strategy is completely invariant with respect to the game horizon. They maintain full contributions through the final stage without any sign of end-game defection or tapering. This implies either that they ignore or deprioritize standard backward-induction logic, or that they hold a norm-based or rule-based strategy (“always contribute fully”) that overrides end-game incentives. There is no evidence of increased self-interest, experimentation, or last-minute opportunism as the end approaches. Thus, they behave as if the cooperative rule is time-independent. Whether they consciously track the remaining rounds and choose to ignore that information, or simply do not integrate it into their decision rule, is unknown.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey never use the punishment mechanism, even though they have ample opportunity and a highly effective punishment technology. Because all players always fully contribute and no one uses punishment, there is no trigger for justified or retaliatory punishment. From this transcript alone, we cannot distinguish whether they refrain from punishing because they are tolerant/forgiving, because they dislike harming others even at a cost-effective rate, or simply because there is no norm violation. Their selectivity and thresholds for punishment are therefore unknown. However, their consistency in not even testing the mechanism suggests a default preference for non-intervention when behavior is cooperative.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey never use the reward mechanism, despite being in a group of perfectly cooperative peers. This indicates that, at least in this environment, they treat reward as unnecessary or not worth the cost, even when others’ behavior is fully aligned with their own cooperative choice. They do not engage in positive reinforcement or gratitude signaling via the formal reward channel. Possible interpretations include: they take mutual full cooperation as baseline/expected behavior that does not merit extra reward; they focus on maximizing their own payoff given that cooperation is already secure; or they simply ignore auxiliary mechanisms altogether. Their behavior does not reveal whether they would reward in a less cooperative group, so their propensity to use rewards strategically (e.g., to encourage higher contributions) remains unknown.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey observe that others consistently match their own cooperative behavior and also avoid spending on punishment and reward. Despite this, they never adjust their own strategy; they already behave in the most cooperative way and keep doing so. There is no evidence of emotional or retaliatory reactions: others’ outcomes are always symmetric and favorable, and they do not attempt to alter that symmetry. They do not respond to others’ payoffs with extra reward, nor do they exploit their cooperative partners by defecting, even late in the game. This suggests they interpret alignment of contributions and payoffs as satisfactory and needing no further intervention.

Their strategy is highly consistent and does not change over time, indicating a strong internal norm or fixed rule rather than reactive adjustment. They appear comfortable with the risk that others might free-ride, although in this instance others also fully cooperate, so their beliefs remain untested; their willingness to repeatedly expose themselves to potential exploitation is inferred but unconfirmed (low confidence). They behave as if efficiency and group welfare are the primary objective, and they do not display concerns about relative payoff advantages or fairness imbalances, since they make no effort to exploit or protect themselves against possible deviations by others.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThey do not send any chat messages. They ignore at least one explicit attempt by another player to engage in discussion about the game setup. This suggests a silent, non-negotiating style: they neither seek to coordinate, nor to persuade, nor to clarify norms verbally. Their cooperation is “action-based” rather than “talk-based.” Motivations for silence are unknown (could be strategic minimalism, disinterest in communication, or external constraints). They also show no observable responsiveness to the content of others’ communication; they simply maintain their existing behavioral pattern.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThey show no end-game shift in behavior. Their contribution pattern is identical early, mid, and late in the game, including the final rounds, despite full knowledge of the remaining number of rounds. There is no decay of cooperation, no final-round defection, and no evidence of strategic horizon-based adjustment. This indicates either a rule-based or norm-based cooperative strategy that is insensitive to the finite-horizon structure, or an absence of opportunistic reasoning about the end of the game.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey never use punishment, despite having access to a relatively powerful and efficient punishment technology. This holds even though the group is fully cooperative, so they never face a genuine temptation to sanction free-riders. As a result, their underlying punishment thresholds and motives are unknown. What is observable is a preference to conserve resources and avoid imposing costs when everyone is already cooperating. They do not engage in any gratuitous or exploratory punishment, suggesting an aversion to unnecessary harm or a narrow, instrumental view of punishment (only worth considering if there is actual misbehavior). Whether they would punish defectors in other conditions remains uncertain.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey never use reward, even though other players fully cooperate throughout. This indicates that they do not pay extra costs to express gratitude, reinforce cooperation, or signal approval when cooperation is already maximal. They appear to treat reward as redundant in an already efficient, fully cooperative equilibrium, rather than as a tool for building or signaling relationships. Their strategy suggests a cost-conscious stance toward positive incentives: as long as others cooperate without needing extra inducement, they keep all remaining payoff rather than spending on symbolic or reinforcing rewards. Whether they would introduce rewards to rescue or encourage cooperation under strain is unknown.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey consistently observe that others cooperate fully and receive identical payoffs, yet they neither adjust their own contributions nor change their use of punishment or reward. This implies satisfaction or at least acceptance of equal, high-payoff outcomes, with no signs of envy, competitive concerns, or attempts to secure relative advantage. Their behavior is stable and unreactive: seeing that others match their contribution, they neither escalate cooperation (already maximal) nor “thank” others via rewards, nor “discipline” anyone.

They always choose to contribute their entire endowment, with no variation across time and no sensitivity to round number. They do not probe, hedge, or adjust based on others’ behavior; instead, they lock into a maximally cooperative strategy from the start and never deviate. Their behavior aligns with a strong fairness norm: equal, full contributions by all are both expected and enacted. They exhibit high risk tolerance with respect to potential exploitation, but in this specific interaction their expectations are met by others’ matching behavior. There is no evidence of strategic self-interest in the narrow sense (they never attempt to free-ride or test whether cooperation would persist under partial contribution). Instead, they act as if cooperation is both normatively right and instrumentally sufficient, and once that equilibrium is visible they simply maintain it.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nTheir communication is extremely sparse and neutral. They send a single brief message wondering whether the current configuration is “the best setup,” which suggests a low-key, analytic curiosity about the game’s structure or efficiency rather than emotional expression or social bonding. They do not attempt explicit coordination, persuasion, or norm-setting; they neither direct others nor respond to any visible chatter from them (none is present). The tone is matter-of-fact and non-confrontational. Overall, they adopt a highly low-communication, low-engagement style: they participate cooperatively through actions rather than through talk, and they show no drive to use chat for negotiation, praise, or sanctioning.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThere is no observable end-game effect on their strategy. They continue full cooperation unchanged up to and including the final round, with no sign of decay, last-round defection, or strategic anticipation of the game’s termination. Despite being able to see the number of remaining rounds, they do not attempt to capitalize on others’ cooperation near the end or to “cash out” on earlier cooperative norms. This pattern is consistent with either a rule-based cooperative type (who treats the contribution choice as a fixed rule regardless of horizon) or a player who is focused on maintaining a stable cooperative pattern and does not shift to backward induction reasoning in practice.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey never use the punishment mechanism, even though it is highly effective in terms of deduction per coin spent. Given that all players contribute fully and no antisocial behavior occurs, there is no obvious behavioral trigger for punishment, so their underlying willingness to punish norm violations remains unknown. What is clear is that they do not engage in punishment for its own sake and do not experiment with it when cooperation is already perfect. This suggests a strictly conditional, if-any, punishment orientation: if they are a punisher at all, they reserve it for actual deviations rather than using it symbolically or preemptively. Their behavior here is consistent with a non-punishing cooperative type in fully cooperative groups.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey never use the reward system, despite its availability and the fact that others cooperate fully. Because rewards are exactly cost-equal to what they grant, using them would be at best redistributive and at worst wasteful from their own perspective; they avoid this entirely. This indicates that they do not seek to “tip,” reinforce, or express gratitude via material rewards when cooperation is already stable and symmetric. They appear to regard mutual full cooperation as sufficient without needing extra positive incentives. Their approach to reward is therefore minimalist and efficiency-oriented: as long as everyone is already doing what they consider appropriate, they see no reason to spend on reinforcement.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey consistently observe that others’ contributions, payoffs, and sanctioning behaviors are identical to their own: full contributions, no spending on punishment or reward, and equal earnings. They make no visible behavioral adjustment in response; they simply match the cooperative pattern and maintain it. The single chat remark about whether they have “the best setup” plausibly reflects recognition that the current outcome—complete symmetry, high joint earnings, and no sanction costs—is already very good, perhaps even optimal given the structure.

Contribution behavior is extremely stable and does not react downward even when partners contribute less. Their pattern reflects a strong internal norm for full cooperation rather than conditional cooperation based on others’ behavior. They tolerate repeated instances of others contributing less without any reduction in their own contribution, indicating low sensitivity to short-term exploitation risk and a willingness to bear that risk to sustain group efficiency. There is no evidence that they strategically shade contributions near the end; they treat all rounds similarly, suggesting either that they do not heavily factor in horizon effects or that they prioritize norm-consistent behavior over end-game optimization. Their fairness standard appears to be that everyone should contribute fully; deviations below full contribution are tolerated in terms of contribution choices (they do not “teach a lesson” by lowering their own contributions) and handled instead via punishment.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nUnknown. No chat content is provided, so their tone, explicit coordination attempts, and responsiveness in messaging cannot be inferred. Any persuasive or engagement style in communication is unknown.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThis player is willing to incur real costs to punish perceived under-contributors and does so selectively and repeatedly toward the same partner who contributes less than the others. They never punish when all players contribute equally and highly, and they never punish the consistently high-contributing partner when that partner matches their own contribution. This indicates a clear norm-enforcing use of punishment rather than random or spiteful use. They appear to view contributions below what the other cooperator is giving as deserving of sanctions, even when the low contributor still gives a nontrivial amount; thus their punishment threshold is relatively strict. They occasionally refrain from punishing moderate under-contribution, so their application is not mechanical; their sanctioning seems to cluster around periods when one player is repeatedly below the other two. The pattern aligns more with deterrence and enforcement of a “everyone should give as much as the top contributor” norm than with retaliation for being personally targeted, because they are never punished themselves and have no need to retaliate. Their punishment is targeted at relative free riding and is not used to settle payoff inequalities arising from punishment by others. Overall, they are a motivated but controlled norm enforcer: not punishing every small deviation, but reliably punishing clear and repeated under-contribution.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThis player appears attentive to the alignment between contributions and resulting payoffs. When the group fully cooperates and payoffs are equal and high, they refrain from sanctioning and maintain full contributions, suggesting satisfaction with mutual gains and no desire to alter an efficient, fair pattern. When one player earns relatively high payoffs while contributing less than the other two, the focal player is willing to reduce that player’s payoff via punishment, implying discomfort with payoff advantages earned through lower contribution. They accept personal payoff reductions to redress these perceived imbalances, indicating that their utility incorporates norm enforcement and distributional concerns, not just own-earnings maximization. They do not react against the partner who also spends on punishment toward the low contributor; there is no observed counter-punishment, suggesting that they perceive aligned norm enforcers as legitimate. They never attempt to equalize outcomes when inequality arises solely from punishment decisions that both enforcers made; they seem primarily focused on penalizing the original low contributor rather than compressing all payoff differences.

They typically give well above the minimum and often at or near the maximum, suggesting a strong cooperative or efficiency-oriented motive rather than pure payoff maximization. Their contributions become especially high when others also contribute fully, indicating conditional cooperation and a preference for mutual full provision when feasible. When a peer contributes noticeably less than the other, the player sometimes lowers their own contribution, but only moderately, not to the level of the low contributor. This reflects an internal fairness norm: they appear unwilling to exploit the group, but also unwilling to fully ignore repeated under-contribution by a specific other. Contribution levels are relatively stable, with only small downward deviations; they do not escalate into a full defection spiral. Risk tolerance appears moderate: the player is willing to commit high contributions even after observing others under-contribute, but uses punishment (rather than sharp contribution drops) to manage the risk of being exploited. Overall, they fit a “strong conditional cooperator with fairness enforcement” profile rather than an unconditional altruist or a pure self-interest maximizer.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nUnknown; there is no chat content in the transcript. The player’s communication style, tone, use of persuasion, or responsiveness in text is therefore unknown. Any inferences about verbal or written coordination strategies or interpersonal tone would be speculative and are not drawn.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThis player is clearly willing to pay to punish, but does so selectively and in a pattern aligned with norm enforcement. Punishment is directed toward the consistently lower contributor rather than toward the high contributor, indicating that the trigger is relative under-contribution rather than personal retaliation against punishment they themselves receive (they are never punished). They do not punish when all group members contribute fully, suggesting they view punishment as a tool for correcting deviations from a high-cooperation standard rather than as an outlet for spite or competitiveness. Their punishment level is nontrivial but not maximal, pointing to a calibration between the cost they bear and the severity of the deviation: they are prepared to incur real personal cost to enforce norms, but they do not appear to escalate indiscriminately. They sometimes punish even while already contributing generously, which lowers their immediate payoff substantially; this indicates a willingness to sacrifice short-run earnings to maintain a cooperative environment, consistent with a deterrence motive. Because punishers are anonymous, their behavior is not about signaling to a specific individual but rather about shaping incentives in the group. There is no evidence of anti-social punishment (they never target a high contributor), nor of “revenge” against someone who reduced their own payoff, so their punishment is best characterized as pro-social norm enforcement.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThe player attends to both contributions and payoffs and adapts in a way consistent with outcome-based fairness concerns. When the low contributor ends up with relatively high payoffs despite contributing less, the player is more likely to punish in that context later, implying that they are sensitive not only to contribution levels but also to the perceived unfairness of resulting payoffs. They refrain from punishing peers who match their high contribution and share similar payoffs, indicating comfort with equitable and efficient outcomes. When punishment from another player is directed at the low contributor, this player’s strategy remains stable and cooperative rather than opportunistic; they do not reduce their own contributions to exploit the punished peer, suggesting they are not driven by relative payoff dominance. Instead, they maintain or return to high contributions when the group moves back toward symmetry. Their occasional moderate reduction in contribution in the presence of a persistently lower contributor, combined with continued or renewed punishment of that peer, indicates a dual-response strategy: slightly protect own payoff via modest under-provision relative to their maximum, while still investing in costly sanctions to pressure the deviator toward the cooperative norm. Overall, they respond to others’ outcomes by trying to re-establish high, roughly equal payoffs across the group rather than by racing to the bottom.", "umap_x": -0.7424982190132141, "umap_y": -1.3248826265335083, "cluster_id": 2, "cluster_size": 40, "cluster_title": "Punishment / Group / Contribution", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around punishment, group, contribution, reward, contributions."}
{"experiment": "5R4kRpHMWpazH7csB", "participant": "yeCAsCQA5hAGDExyZ", "game_finished": true, "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a generally cooperative, inequality-accepting conditional cooperator with some mild, self-serving deviation from the group norm. They repeatedly show that they are willing to contribute at or near the full endowment when they believe others will also do so, and they never contribute less than half their endowment. Their pattern alternates between full cooperation and moderate under-contribution relative to peers who consistently give the maximum. When they under-contribute, they still remain well above the selfish minimum, suggesting they prioritize maintaining a cooperative public good while extracting a modest relative advantage.\n\nTheir behavior indicates sensitivity to others’ contributions: when peers are fully cooperative, they sometimes match them, but at other times deliberately contribute less while relying on the others’ higher contributions to sustain high group payoffs. This suggests awareness of the marginal per capita return and a willingness to “ride” on others’ generosity without entirely undermining cooperation. They do not converge to a stable single level of contribution; instead, they oscillate between full and partial giving, indicating strategic experimentation and low contribution rigidity.\n\nFairness seems defined in a loose, outcome-focused way rather than strict equality of contributions. The player tolerates being the lowest contributor in several instances without taking compensatory, punitive action. This points to relatively high risk tolerance regarding being perceived as a free rider and low concern about contribution-based fairness norms, as long as group efficiency is reasonably preserved and others do not directly attack them beyond what they can profitably ignore.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nUnknown. There is no observable chat content or explicit communication from or to this player in the transcript, so their tone, persuasion style, and direct responsiveness in conversation are not inferable. Their coordination style must therefore be inferred solely from contribution and punishment choices, which show implicit, nonverbal coordination rather than explicit negotiation.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThis player never uses punishment, even when they are clearly singled out and repeatedly targeted with costly sanctions while contributing less than the others. Their consistent refusal to punish holds across situations of both alignment (all contribute equally) and misalignment (they contribute less than the others and are punished). This indicates a strong reluctance to spend resources on sanctions, regardless of provocation.\n\nThe absence of any punitive response when they are targeted suggests they do not engage in retaliation, even when it would be emotionally understandable. They instead absorb punishment as an environmental cost rather than as a personal affront requiring response. This pattern implies they are not motivated by third-party norm enforcement or second-party revenge. They do not use punishment as a deterrent tool either; their own contributions and their peers’ contributions stabilize and recover without any sanctioning effort from them, which may reinforce their belief that punishing is unnecessary or inefficient.\n\nSelectivity is extreme in the sense that their threshold for punishing appears effectively unreachable within the observed environment: persistent disadvantage in payoffs via deductions and systematic over-contribution by others do not trigger sanctions from them. This aligns with a strategy that prioritizes net earnings and avoids the deadweight loss of punishment, even at the cost of allowing others to discipline them without response.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThis player appears largely payoff-focused and stoic in response to others’ outcomes. They see others repeatedly sacrifice resources to punish them, lowering those others’ payoffs relative to the no-punishment baseline, yet they do not adjust by counter-punishing or matching their partners’ higher contribution levels in a strictly reciprocal way. Instead, their main behavioral adjustment is to intermittently return to full contribution, which aligns with maximizing own payoff given others’ high contributions and potential willingness to punish.\n\nThey show tolerance of asymmetry in both contributions and final payoffs: they sometimes earn more than at least one peer when contributing less, and at other times accept being disadvantaged through deductions without any overt corrective action. This patience suggests that they interpret punishment as a structural feature of the game rather than as a personal signal requiring retaliation. Their intermittent return to full cooperation after being punished indicates that they are responsive to the economic environment (recognizing that mutual high contribution yields strong returns) rather than to the social or emotional message implied by others’ costly punishment.\n\nOverall, they respond to others’ actions and payoffs through quiet strategic adjustment of their own contribution levels, not through expressive use of the punishment mechanism. They accept that others may “pay to discipline” them while they continue to optimize within that constraint, adopting a pragmatic, low-conflict posture toward others’ outcomes.", "umap_x": -0.2921138107776642, "umap_y": -1.0908113718032837, "cluster_id": 2, "cluster_size": 40, "cluster_title": "Punishment / Group / Contribution", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around punishment, group, contribution, reward, contributions."}
{"experiment": "5peepGs4D4ExMXS4R", "participant": "4BiTaMHuLF3NuHYDm", "game_finished": true, "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThe player is a persistent, calculated free rider who occasionally “tops up” contributions but rarely matches the group norm of full cooperation. They almost always keep some of their endowment back, even when everyone else contributes the maximum and explicitly asks them to do the same. Their contributions are volatile and do not converge to the group standard: they oscillate between very low and mid‑high amounts, with only a few instances of matching the group’s full contribution.\n\nThey condition their giving only weakly on others’ behavior. Even after observing repeated unanimous full contributions by all other players, they continue to under‑contribute in most rounds, suggesting they prioritize individual payoff over joint efficiency. When they temporarily increase their contribution toward the group norm, they later revert to under‑contributing, indicating that group pressure and punishment do not produce stable, long‑term compliance.\n\nThey do not appear motivated by standard fairness norms (e.g., “everyone contributes equally”); instead, they systematically exploit the high multiplier provided by others’ generosity. Their risk tolerance seems moderate: they are willing to risk social disapproval and large monetary punishment costs imposed by others in order to maintain a positive payoff advantage, but they occasionally raise contributions enough to avoid becoming completely ostracized. The behavior is consistent with a “strategic defector who occasionally cooperates enough not to be completely isolated,” rather than with a consistent altruist or a purely random player.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThe player is largely silent and minimally engaged. They only speak a few times, typically with very short, laconic messages. They do not attempt to organize the group, propose strategies, or justify their deviations from the agreed‑upon norm. They also do not respond directly to repeated social pressure, moral appeals, or questions about their motives, except in one brief case where they answer a simple challenge and one offhand response about music preference.\n\nTheir tone is flat and neutral rather than apologetic, defensive, or confrontational. They neither argue with others over norms nor attempt to defuse hostility. This creates an impression of emotional detachment: they let others talk about them, insult them, and theorize about their identity while mostly remaining silent.\n\nThey occasionally use first‑person plural when referring to themselves, which other players find suspicious. They do not clarify this, even when directly questioned about pronouns, reinforcing the sense that they are unconcerned with others’ perceptions. Overall, their communication style is low‑effort, low‑disclosure, and reactive rather than proactive: they respond when directly prompted in simple ways but do not pursue dialogue or persuasion about contribution strategies.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThe player is aware of the horizon and changes behavior near the end. In the very last round—explicitly identified as such—they fully match the group’s cooperative norm after a long history of under‑contribution. Immediately before the final round, they still deviate from the consensus but not maximally; their contributions become relatively higher as the game approaches its conclusion.\n\nThey do not engage in a classic end‑game defection spike; instead, their final move is fully cooperative. This suggests several possibilities (with low confidence on exact motives): they may want to end on a “clean” or less antagonistic note; they may respond to the salience of the finality and the explicitly social, “good game” tone adopted by others; or they may treat the last round as an opportunity to conform once reputation and punishment can no longer affect future payoffs. They also briefly participate in closing social niceties, which they mostly avoided earlier, hinting at a slight softening or desire to leave a neutral or mildly positive impression at the end.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThe player is willing to punish and does so multiple times, even while being a clear free rider themselves. Their punishment choices are not straightforwardly norm‑enforcing: they primarily target players who are among the most vocally critical of their behavior or who explicitly mention them in a negative or threatening way. This pattern suggests that retaliation and irritation are prominent motives, rather than a principled attempt to sanction low contributors (who do not exist in this group aside from the player).\n\nTheir punishment is selective rather than random: they focus on a small subset of peers who are particularly outspoken about rules, fairness, or punishing defectors. In that sense, they seem to use punishment as a way to “push back” against social pressure and public shaming, even though it is costly and does not visibly change group behavior.\n\nThey do not appear to test the deterrent value of punishment in a systematic way; they are consistently the worst contributor, so they cannot credibly claim they punish for group benefit. Instead, their pattern aligns with a “spiteful or retaliatory punisher” type: someone willing to spend resources to impose costs on critics, even when this does not improve their own future payoffs or their image. In later rounds, they sometimes refrain from punishing, suggesting no compulsion to punish every slight; their use of punishment is intermittent and emotionally triggered rather than strategic and calculated.\n\n<REWARD>\nThe player also uses rewards, but in a scattered, idiosyncratic way. Early on, they reward several fully cooperative peers even while under‑contributing themselves, which is inconsistent with purely selfish profit maximization but consistent with cheap “tipping” behavior to specific individuals they find likable or useful. They later reward different players, including some who never deviated from the norm and some who engaged positively in chat. There is no clear pattern linking rewards to changes in others’ contributions, as the rest of the group is already fully cooperative and stays that way.\n\nTheir rewards thus look more like personal gestures than calculated reinforcement. They sometimes reward players they have also previously punished, and they reward both strong cooperators and vocal critics, indicating they are not strictly using rewards to manage alliances or repair reputations in a systematic way. The reward behavior suggests a somewhat playful or experimental streak: they are willing to spend a modest amount of coins to acknowledge others without fully committing to group norms themselves.\n\nTaken together, their punishment and reward use portray a “contrarian, partly spiteful, partly whimsical” social type: someone who free rides on cooperation, occasionally retaliates against social pressure, but also distributes small positive tokens in a way that seems more expressive than strategically optimizing.", "umap_x": -0.6579723954200745, "umap_y": -1.3732322454452515, "cluster_id": 2, "cluster_size": 40, "cluster_title": "Punishment / Group / Contribution", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around punishment, group, contribution, reward, contributions."}
{"experiment": "5peepGs4D4ExMXS4R", "participant": "4mxQjdCwzDNLHR8Ym", "game_finished": true, "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a mostly high, near-unconditional cooperator with one early defection. They typically contribute the full endowment, aligning with the group’s all‑in norm despite the presence of a clear low contributor. The one substantial under‑contribution occurs after initial cooperative rounds and during a period when several others also begin experimenting with lower amounts; there is no explicit justification offered, so the motive is unknown (could be curiosity, mild strategic hedging, or a brief lapse in norm adherence; confidence low). After that, they revert to fully cooperative play and maintain it steadily until the end, including the final round, showing no last‑round exploitation. They do not appear to condition their own contributions directly on punishment dynamics: they keep cooperating even when others focus heavily on sanctioning a deviant. They explicitly state that contributing fully “only makes sense” given the high multiplier, indicating they understand the game’s incentives and see full cooperation as individually rational under these parameters. Overall, they exhibit a “principled cooperator” profile with a single unexplained deviation rather than a pattern of opportunistic free‑riding.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThey speak rarely but when they do, they are calm, analytical, and group‑oriented. Early on, they publicly endorse the norm that full contributions are the rational way to maximize returns, appealing to shared economic logic rather than emotion or threats. Later, when a persistent low contributor dominates discussion, they frame the situation explicitly as part of a behavioral experiment, showing meta‑awareness of the research context and distancing themselves from the emotional, punitive tone of some others. Their messages seek to interpret the situation more than to pressure or shame individuals. They do not engage in direct confrontation or personal attacks and do not try to coordinate punishment or reward schemes. They are responsive enough to reference the group’s evolving situation but do not actively drive the chat or negotiate detailed strategies. Tone is mildly humorous and reflective rather than heated or reactive, suggesting a preference for low‑conflict, cognitively framed interaction over moralistic or hostile commentary.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThey show awareness of the finite horizon when it is mentioned by others but do not alter their strategy to exploit the last rounds. Contributions stay maximally cooperative through the final period, including the very last decision, despite the clear opportunity to defect with minimal future repercussions. They do not participate in the emerging “last round reflection” and “goodbye” chatter beyond having already emphasized earlier that cooperation is rational; at the end they still neither punish nor reward. There is no sign of cooperation decay or end‑game opportunism: their behavior remains consistent with the same payoff‑maximization logic they voiced earlier, treating the final round similarly to earlier ones. Any subtle shift in beliefs or emotions about others at the end is unknown; their actions suggest stable norms rather than horizon‑driven recalculation.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey never punish anyone, despite repeated, salient norm violations by a specific low contributor and strong social pressure from others to sanction that player. This holds even after extensive public discussion of punishment as a tool for enforcing cooperation. There is no recorded justification from them for abstaining, so exact motives are uncertain. However, their earlier emphasis on maximizing earnings and later framing of the situation as a behavioral experiment suggest they may see punishment as either inefficient (costly with dubious marginal benefits) or as something they prefer not to engage in within an experimental context (confidence moderate, not certain). They do not use punishment instrumentally, either for deterrence or retaliation, and they do not join in “punish the deviant” cascades. Their type fits a “non‑punitive cooperator”: they rely on their own contributions and the group’s norms, not on costly sanctions, even when those sanctions are socially encouraged and emotionally charged.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey likewise never reward anyone, despite being in a highly cooperative group where positive reciprocity would be easy and socially supported. They receive rewards from others multiple times but do not reciprocate or build on that behavior. There is no explicit statement of why, so the exact reasoning is unknown. Given their emphasis on maximizing income, and the symmetric cost and benefit of reward here, the most plausible interpretation is that they see rewarding as individually and socially neutral or wasteful rather than as a useful coordination tool (confidence moderate). They do not attempt to strategically reinforce others’ cooperation through bonuses, but also do not criticize others for using rewards. In personality terms, they resemble a “pure contribution utilitarian”: willing to contribute heavily to the public good when the multiplier is high, but unwilling to spend additional resources on second‑order tools like reward or punishment, even when others use them generously toward them.", "umap_x": -0.47206273674964905, "umap_y": -1.616044521331787, "cluster_id": 2, "cluster_size": 40, "cluster_title": "Punishment / Group / Contribution", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around punishment, group, contribution, reward, contributions."}

They always give the maximum available amount and never experiment with lower contributions, even after repeated free-riding by another player. Their cooperative behavior is stable and not contingent on short-term reciprocity or on whether others perfectly match their level. They endorse the efficiency norm that everyone should contribute all their coins and explicitly frame “everyone all-in” as the correct and obvious strategy. They care about group payoff and appear comfortable foregoing private-pocket gains when the multiplier makes contributions socially (and individually) efficient. They do not display risk aversion about being exploited; instead, they treat persistent full contribution as the baseline and focus on managing norm violators through talk and punishment rather than by reducing their own contributions.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThey are active, engaged, and often take on a norm-enforcing, slightly exasperated tone. Early on, they help coordinate by explaining that universal full contribution is the way “to win” and by reminding others that low contributions are visible. They single out the low contributor by name, use direct address (“come on”, “we see you”), and issue explicit social pressure and “last chance” warnings. Their style mixes light humor and sarcasm (e.g., joking about bots, conjoined twins, and not knowing a band) with clear moral judgment of under-contribution as “not funny” or stubborn. They respond readily to ongoing discussion about punishment vs. ignoring, sometimes aligning verbally with “don’t waste money” arguments but nevertheless retaining a punitive stance in their own actions. They notice linguistic details from others and treat them as potentially suspicious or indicative of hidden structure (e.g., reacting to plural self-reference), which suggests a mildly investigative, theory-of-mind orientation. Overall they are socially engaged, willing to banter, but primarily use communication to enforce cooperation norms and to comment on fairness.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThey are clearly aware of the finite horizon: they acknowledge the final round when others mention it and express disappointment that the game is ending. Despite approaching the end, they do not reduce their contributions or display last-round selfishness; they continue to contribute fully in both the penultimate and final rounds. They do not switch into end-game punishment sprees or “last chance to hit defectors” behavior; instead, their punishment usage actually stops before the very end. They show mild emotional reaction to the game ending but keep their behavior consistent with their earlier cooperative pattern. There is no observable decay in cooperation; if anything, their strategy becomes more stable and straightforward as the game concludes.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey are willing to engage in costly punishment of a chronic low contributor and do so multiple times, but only toward that one individual. They never punish high contributors or anyone else, indicating a selective focus on clear norm violators rather than retaliating broadly or indulging in spite. Their triggers are repeated, salient under-contribution by the same player, especially after social pressure and appeals to cooperate have failed. Their talk oscillates between “save your money, they won’t change” and calls to punish, and in practice they sometimes punish even when they verbally endorse non-punishment, suggesting a mix of emotional satisfaction and norm-enforcement motives rather than a purely income-maximizing calculus. They appear to view punishment as deserved retribution and as a collective enforcement tool (“punish punish”), though they also show some awareness that over-punishing may not be outcome-optimal. They never retaliate when punished themselves, implying that their punishment is directed at fairness violations, not at personal slights.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey never spend any of their own coins on rewards, despite being in a highly cooperative group and receiving rewards from others. This implies a strong preference for conserving resources over actively reinforcing good behavior via the costly reward mechanism. Their positive reactions to group cooperation are expressed verbally (“yay”, approval of all-in behavior) rather than monetarily. They do not propose reward schemes or speak in favor of distributing bonuses to high contributors; their focus stays on exhortation and, when needed, punishment of the sole defector. This suggests they see cooperation as the expected default that does not merit special reward, while defection is a violation that may justify cost-bearing sanctions.", "umap_x": -0.6203616857528687, "umap_y": -1.8463808298110962, "cluster_id": 2, "cluster_size": 40, "cluster_title": "Punishment / Group / Contribution", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around punishment, group, contribution, reward, contributions."}

They usually contribute the full endowment and actively endorse “all-in” as the group norm, aligning their behavior with that stated norm almost every round. Their single clear under-contribution occurs when the group’s coordination frays and several others also lower contributions; this looks more like a momentary drift with the group than a calculated long-term free ride. Once the group re-establishes near-unanimous high cooperation, they return to full contributions and maintain them through to the end, including the final round, showing little classic end-game defection. They appear motivated by maximizing the group pot and by having a “good group” experience, accepting that their personal best response is to keep contributing even when one player (Sloth) defects. Their fairness norm is inclusive: they pressure the low contributor socially but keep cooperating for the sake of the majority, tolerating some inequality rather than undermining the group outcome.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nTheir tone is upbeat, friendly, humorous, and socially engaged. They actively participate in coordination, explicitly endorsing collective “all-in” strategies and expressing enthusiasm when the group succeeds. They respond to others’ ideas (for example, agreeing with someone’s suggestion not to overuse punishment, or echoing proposed strategies), show awareness of gender pronouns, and lightly joke about identity and meta-game topics (bots, researchers, DID, Barbados, etc.). They are supportive toward the group and even mildly supportive toward the problematic player, at times addressing that player directly with polite appeals and expressing “faith” and disappointment rather than hostility. They are quick to adopt group slang and humor, which suggests a socially attuned, affiliative style. They do not initiate complex strategic arguments but do align with others’ reasoning, especially when it supports continued cooperation and low spite. Overall, they engage rather than withdraw, using chat to reinforce group cohesion and norms.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThey show clear awareness of the finite horizon once it is pointed out but do not exploit it. Contributions remain maximal through the last rounds, including the final one, with no sign of deliberate last-round defection. Their chat in the final stage shifts toward closure and social niceties (“pleasure playing,” “gg”) rather than strategic recalculation, indicating they prioritize maintaining a positive group narrative over squeezing out minor extra personal gains. They do not suddenly increase punishment or reward intensity at the end; their behavior in sanctioning stays modest and consistent with their earlier pattern. Overall, horizon awareness does not erode their cooperation; they stick to the cooperative identity they have established.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey are generally restraint-prone but not absolutist: they mostly avoid using punishment despite group pressure and recognize the opportunity cost of sanctioning in this high-multiplier environment. Early on, they explicitly state a reluctance to deduct and typically follow through on that, even when others are calling aggressively for punishment. However, they do punish the chronic under-contributor selectively and sparingly, once following group frustration and once after a salient perceived “betrayal” of renewed cooperation. This suggests their trigger is a mix of norm violation and emotional disappointment rather than pure payoff optimization. The low intensity and target selectivity imply a primarily norm-enforcing or expressive motive (signaling disapproval and “we had faith in you”) rather than an attempt to maximize deterrence through heavy, repeated sanctions. They never punish anyone else and never use punishment for retaliation or personal vendetta against cooperators. Overall, they are a “reluctant norm enforcer”: mostly against spending on punishment, but willing to use a small, targeted amount when expectations of cooperation are repeatedly violated.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey never spend their own coins to reward others, even though they verbally appreciate the group and sometimes speak approvingly of mutual help. Given the cost/benefit symmetry of the reward mechanism, this absence may reflect a belief that reward is not strategically necessary when the group is already tightly coordinated, or that conserving income beats symbolic generosity. They do notice and acknowledge being rewarded (implicitly, by reacting positively to the group and staying cooperative), but they do not reciprocate via the mechanism itself. Their preference appears to be to reward socially—through praise, solidarity, and continued full cooperation—rather than through costly formal rewards.

They always give the full endowment to the public pool in every round, including early, mid, and final rounds, and they never test partial or low contributions. Their behavior indicates that they prioritize group efficiency and seem comfortable taking on the small individual risk that others might free-ride, even after clear evidence of a persistent low contributor. They appear to adopt a norm of “always all-in” and stick to it, rather than condition contributions on others’ behavior. There is no sign that they adjust their giving in response to defection, punishment debates, or end-game proximity. Fairness concerns show up not in reducing their own contributions but in supporting punishment for the repeated low contributor. They tolerate the inequity of being exploited as long as the group pot remains high, suggesting they value collective maximization and consistency more than strict reciprocity at the contribution stage.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThey communicate in a light, joking, socially engaged style and actively participate in group coordination. Early on they propose mutual help and later explicitly commit to continuing to give the maximum. They align themselves with the cooperative norm and reinforce the “all-in together” identity. When discussing the problematic low contributor, they use humorous, game-referential language to frame that player as an outsider and justify punitive attitudes, but they do not become hostile or abusive; their tone stays playful rather than angry. They occasionally ask about others’ earnings, suggesting curiosity and situational awareness rather than indifference to payoffs. They engage more than many purely silent cooperators but do not dominate the conversation or try to micro-manage others. They respond to the social mood: they back all-in coordination, join in group jokes, and echo the group’s frustration with the low contributor while keeping things light. Overall, they are socially affiliative, norm-affirming, and use humor to maintain cohesion around cooperation and punishment.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThey show awareness of the horizon when it is mentioned but do not alter their core strategy. Even as the game approaches its final rounds, they continue to contribute the full endowment without any sign of last-round defection or hedging. They do not exploit the final rounds to free-ride despite having perfect knowledge of remaining rounds. Their punishment behavior also does not escalate or systematically spike at the end; they refrain from using the mechanism in the final round. The only explicit end-of-game response is a brief social closing remark, matching others’ “good game” signaling. This pattern suggests that they either prioritize a rule-based cooperative identity over backward-induction logic, or they discount the theoretical gains from last-round defection relative to the satisfaction (or habit) of playing fully cooperative to the end. Their end-game behavior is consistent with a type that values internal consistency and group harmony more than opportunistic timing.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey are willing to use costly punishment selectively and repeatedly against a clear, persistent low contributor, but they never punish anyone else. Their punishment is not impulsive; early in the interaction they withhold punishment despite the opportunity. They only begin to punish after the low contributor repeatedly deviates from the widely agreed “all-in” norm and after there is open group discussion labeling that player as problematic. Once they form the view that this player is non-cooperative and unresponsive, they still sometimes punish and sometimes refrain, suggesting mixed motives: both norm enforcement and emotional satisfaction, but tempered by cost awareness. Their chat comments frame punishment as appropriate targeting of someone “sus” rather than generalized aggression. They never retaliate against anyone who punishes them (they are punished once by others) and they do not use punishment to settle interpersonal scores or disagreements. In sum, they are a conditional punisher: focused on a salient, repeated defector, motivated by norm enforcement and perhaps deterrence, without broad vindictiveness.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey never actively spend on reward, but they accept and acknowledge rewards given by others. There is no sign that they are opposed to rewarding in principle; rather, they simply do not allocate their own coins to it. Their behavior suggests that, when deciding how to use discretionary coins, they prioritize maintaining their own payoff and occasionally punishing defectors over pro-social rewarding. They seem to view cooperation itself (going all-in and encouraging others verbally) as sufficient positive reinforcement, and they leave material rewards to more reward-oriented players. Their lack of rewarding is therefore most plausibly interpreted as cost-consciousness and a focus on negative sanctioning of clear norm violators rather than strategic use of positive incentives. Overall, they are a non-rewarding but socially encouraging cooperator.", "umap_x": -0.4269927442073822, "umap_y": -1.6869580745697021, "cluster_id": 2, "cluster_size": 40, "cluster_title": "Punishment / Group / Contribution", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around punishment, group, contribution, reward, contributions."}

They normally match or exceed the emerging group norm of maximal contribution and clearly endorse the collective “all-in” coordination scheme. Their behavior suggests they internalize a fairness norm that everyone should contribute fully when the multiplier is high. The single low-contribution episode appears as an outlier rather than a strategy shift; there is no accompanying justification in chat, and afterward they revert to full contributions and remain there through the end, including the final round. They tolerate the presence of a low contributor in the group as long as overall cooperation is high, and they do not reduce their own contributions in response to that free-riding; instead, they continue to prioritize group efficiency. Risk-wise, they are willing to rely on others’ cooperation despite clear evidence of at least one persistent defector, indicating relatively high social trust and low fear of being exploited at the contribution stage.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThey communicate in a warm, affiliative, and coordination-oriented style. Early on they explicitly endorse the shared “all in” strategy in a friendly tone and check procedurally whether the group’s agreed plan is “do nothing and just submit” in the punishment/reward phase, indicating attention to collective norms and a desire not to deviate inadvertently. They do not engage in moralizing, blaming, or direct confrontation; they leave norm-enforcement rhetoric to others and focus on constructive clarification and closing rituals. They are responsive to group-level conversation (e.g., adopting the all-in language and participating in the end-of-game thanks) rather than steering the discourse. Socially, they present as prosocial, polite, and harmony-seeking, supporting group cohesion rather than escalating conflicts around the low contributor.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThey remain fully cooperative at the end and do not exhibit classic end-game defection. Even when it is clear that only a few rounds remain and others are openly discussing last-round behavior, they stay at maximal contribution and continue to reward others rather than hoarding points. They do not attempt to exploit the final round despite having observed repeated free-riding and some chaotic punishment behavior. Their end-game communication is appreciative and group-oriented, reinforcing a shared “team” identity rather than shifting to individualistic calculation. This pattern suggests that their cooperation is driven more by internal norms and social preferences than by backward induction logic or myopic profit maximization.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey are willing but selective punishers. They target only the persistently low contributor and never punish high contributors or random others. Their punishment is mild relative to what is possible in the mechanism and appears aimed at norm enforcement rather than retaliation: they do not respond punitively to being punished themselves, and they avoid joining the most aggressive punishers. They sometimes refrain from punishing even when others are calling for strong sanctions, and they briefly experiment with “ignore and maximize” versus “lightly punish” approaches. Over the course of the game, they oscillate between small, consistent punishment of the deviant and restraint, never escalating in intensity. The evidence suggests their motive is to signal disapproval of free-riding while still mainly preserving their own payoff and the overall pot; they do not seem to derive direct satisfaction from hurting the target, nor do they use punishment to settle personal scores.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey are an extremely generous, almost indiscriminate rewarder. Across most rounds, they reward nearly every peer except themselves, including the low contributor at least once, even when that player is under social scrutiny. Their rewarding is not tightly conditioned on exact contribution levels; instead, it reflects a broad prosocial norm of “support everyone who’s here,” functioning more like a group-bonding or gratitude ritual than a strategic incentive scheme. The rewards are spread widely and consistently rather than being used sparingly to shape marginal behavior. They do not retaliate through withholding rewards when punished by others; they continue to reward those same peers, indicating low vindictiveness and a forgiving stance. Economically, this is costly and offers no direct gain, so it likely expresses a strong preference for generosity, mutual appreciation, and maintaining a positive group atmosphere over strict payoff maximization.", "umap_x": -0.2048020362854004, "umap_y": -1.510705828666687, "cluster_id": 2, "cluster_size": 40, "cluster_title": "Punishment / Group / Contribution", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around punishment, group, contribution, reward, contributions."}

Their default pattern is to put the full endowment into the public good whenever they believe the group norm is “everyone contributes max,” and they actively endorse that norm in chat. They briefly deviate once to a low contribution, which stands out against an otherwise consistent all-in pattern. That lone deviation does not recur, suggesting either a brief experiment, misclick, or momentary shift rather than a strategy change; they immediately return to full cooperation thereafter. They do not appear to condition contributions on others’ behavior in a fine-grained way: even when a single persistent low contributor (Sloth) keeps under-contributing, they keep contributing fully. This indicates a strong group-efficiency orientation and a relatively high willingness to “absorb” some exploitation to maintain a large pot. Their behavior fits a “pro-social conditional only at the extremes” type: they follow the group’s cooperative plan as long as most others do, but are willing to use punishment instead of reducing their own contributions when facing a chronic defector. Risk tolerance is moderate-to-high: they repeatedly expose themselves to the risk of others free-riding by contributing max, apparently trusting the large group and the high multiplier more than worrying about individual defectors.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThey are brief, affirmative, and strongly coordination-focused. Early in the game they actively reinforce an “all-in every time” plan, repeating and endorsing the max-contribution norm without adding detailed argument. They do not engage in side conversations, jokes, or off-topic socializing; their messages are short confirmations, calls to cooperate, and very minimal closing remarks. They show responsiveness to the emerging group norm: when others propose going all-in, they immediately support it, and later when the session ends they join the general “gg” closure without initiating extra commentary. They do not publicly discuss punishment, strategy trade-offs, or their own feelings about others’ behavior, even when the group debates whether to punish or ignore the low contributor. This suggests an engagement style that is cooperative but low-visibility: they help cement norms with simple, clear signals, but avoid arguments and do not attempt to persuade deviants directly. Tone stays positive and non-confrontational throughout; they never insult, blame, or single out anyone in chat.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThey remain fully cooperative right through the final rounds, with no observable end-game defection. Even when others mention that the last round has arrived and jokingly anticipate possible “betrayal,” they simply keep contributing the maximum and do not change their punishment or reward behavior. They show awareness of the horizon only in the sense that they acknowledge the “gg” ritual at the very end. Their strategy does not shift as the finish approaches: no attempt to exploit the final period, no last-minute retaliation, no last-round signaling via rewards or punishments. This indicates that their cooperative rule is not based on backward induction about future punishment or reciprocity, but more on a stable principle of “always all-in if the group is mostly cooperating,” regardless of imminent termination.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey are willing to punish, but only in a highly targeted and limited way. Across the game they punish exactly one individual, the persistent low contributor, and never punish anyone else. They do this in a few discrete bursts while continuing to contribute fully, which points to a moralistic or norm-enforcing motive rather than an income-maximizing one: punishing reduces their own payoff, but they still choose it against a conspicuous defector. They do not respond in chat when others debate whether punishing is wasteful or counterproductive, yet their actions show they side with the enforcement camp. They do not escalate to extreme levels like some others claim to do; their punishment intensity remains modest compared to what is possible, suggesting they aim to express disapproval and perhaps deter, rather than to destroy the target’s payoff. They never use punishment for retaliation against anyone who punished them (they are occasionally punished themselves, but never respond in kind), and they never punish moderate cooperators who slightly deviate from the norm. Overall they behave as a selective altruistic punisher: willing to incur costs to sanction clear chronic under-contribution, but uninterested in vendettas or broad punitive campaigns.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey almost never use the reward mechanism despite being in a highly cooperative group where most others consistently go all-in. Their reward spending is effectively zero; any rewards they receive always come from others. This suggests they prioritize conserving coins or see reward as redundant when cooperation is already high. Since they do enforce norms via punishment against the one defector, their lack of rewarding is not due to complete indifference to mechanisms, but rather a preference for negative sanctions over positive reinforcement as a tool. They also never explicitly advocate rewarding in chat nor publicly thank specific rewarders, indicating that gratitude signaling and strategic positive reinforcement are not central to their style. In new PGG environments, this type is best modeled as a strong cooperator and occasional punisher who expects cooperation to be its own reward and does not invest in explicit bonus payments for good behavior.", "umap_x": -0.5493658781051636, "umap_y": -1.6651005744934082, "cluster_id": 2, "cluster_size": 40, "cluster_title": "Punishment / Group / Contribution", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around punishment, group, contribution, reward, contributions."}

They strongly endorse full contributions verbally and usually match that with behavior, giving the maximum in almost all rounds. Their single under-contribution happens when the group norm is still strongly “all-in,” suggesting exploratory or impulsive deviation rather than a calculated long-term strategy; they neither justify nor repeat it, and they revert immediately to full cooperation. They do not appear to condition their contributions on Sloth’s free-riding; despite openly noticing non-cooperation, they keep putting in the maximum, prioritizing group efficiency over personal payoff. They do not chase extra profit in the final rounds; knowing the game is ending does not reduce their contributions. Overall, they act as a principled cooperator with high tolerance for being exploited by one deviant, apparently valuing the collective outcome and shared mood over narrow payoff maximization.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThe player is socially engaged, humorous, and emotionally attuned to group dynamics. Early on they actively promote coordination on full contributions, using inclusive language that frames cooperation as a group project. They respond to others’ comments, echoing pro-cooperation messages, and contribute light banter (sports, music, “drainers,” joking about bankrupting the researcher, playful football-team rivalry) that helps maintain a convivial atmosphere. They show a mild skeptical/analytic side when they remark that some participants “sound like bots,” but this does not lead to withdrawal or hostility; they continue to cooperate and stay playful. They occasionally advocate leniency and empathy (asking others to “go easy” on a low contributor, suggesting “just leave them be”), signaling discomfort with aggressive norm-enforcement. They also engage Sloth directly, including asking about pronouns and musical taste, which suggests curiosity and a desire to humanize even the deviant player. Overall, they communicate as a sociable, group-oriented, slightly ironic but fundamentally warm participant who uses chat to bond and coordinate rather than to threaten or shame.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThe player is clearly aware there is a last round and that some might consider end-game defection or “betrayal,” but they do not change their cooperative strategy. They continue to contribute the maximum at the end, and they do not exploit the final punishment/reward phase, despite having previously used those tools. Their last-round chat focuses on social closure (saying good game, targeting friendly jokes at specific subgroups like fans of a particular football club) rather than strategic maneuvering. They acknowledge someone’s plan to reward Sloth in the final phase but then do not actually send rewards, suggesting either a last-moment re-evaluation of cost–benefit or simple inaction, not a shift toward hostility. Unlike some others, they do not try a final “revenge” against Sloth nor a last push to shape future behavior (which is impossible anyway). Their behavior indicates an absence of end-game opportunism: they maintain the same cooperative pattern and close the interaction with friendly, group-affirming messages.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThe player is generally reluctant to punish but not strictly anti-punishment. They endorse full cooperation norms and clearly notice free-riding, yet they mostly argue for tolerance and focusing on own earnings rather than repeated deductions. Their single use of punishment is selective and targeted at the chronic under-contributor when group frustration is high, indicating they accept norm-enforcement as legitimate in extreme cases but do not enjoy or prioritize it. They do not join large cascades of punitive behavior even when others describe heavy deductions and celebrate them; they refrain from “piling on” in later rounds despite ongoing provocations. Their motives appear mixed: they care about fairness and collective norms, but they weigh the monetary cost and also express that it may be better to “just leave them be.” Deterrence seems less central to them than to others; they do not interpret punishment as their personal mission, nor do they attempt to micromanage Sloth’s behavior through repeated sanctions. They never use punishment vindictively or in response to personal loss, and there is no evidence of antisocial punishment. Overall, they are a “reluctant enforcer”: willing to sanction once for severe norm breach, then defaulting back to restraint.\n\n<REWARD>\nThe player is unusually willing to reward and uses reward in a generous, sometimes non-selfish manner. They execute one large, costly burst of rewards, distributing positive transfers widely to almost all group members, including the main free-rider and many cooperators. This suggests they see rewards as a way to acknowledge participation, support group cohesion, and perhaps test whether kindness can shift the deviant player’s behavior. They explicitly mention “giving money to the sloth” and later jokingly attribute Sloth’s improved contribution to having sent coins, showing a belief—or at least a hopeful narrative—that positive incentives can work. They also later reward Sloth again after partial improvement, indicating a forgiving and reinforcement-oriented stance toward previously non-cooperative behavior. They do not seem to reward strategically to maximize personal returns (since tech is 1:1 and costly); instead, their reward behavior is more expressive and prosocial than profit-maximizing. In the final round, even though they say they will give money for a shared music interest, they end up not rewarding, which could be due to a last-minute reconsideration of cost, time constraints, or simple inattention; the transcript does not allow a clear motive (unknown). Overall, their “type” on rewarding is generous, forgiving, and experiment-minded: they are willing to pay substantial personal cost to encourage cooperation and build rapport, especially through positive rather than negative incentives.", "umap_x": -0.0042248740792274475, "umap_y": -1.8071651458740234, "cluster_id": 2, "cluster_size": 40, "cluster_title": "Punishment / Group / Contribution", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around punishment, group, contribution, reward, contributions."}

They always contribute their entire endowment in every round, with no deviation despite the presence of a persistent low contributor. Their behavior indicates that they anchor on “maximize group pot = maximize personal payoff” and treat the marginal per-coin return as clearly dominating any temptation to free-ride. They show no evidence of conditional cooperation based on others’ contributions: the appearance of a chronic under-contributor and fluctuating group average does not change their own contribution level. They display high risk tolerance regarding potential last-round defection by others and never attempt “last-minute” self-serving deviation, even once they explicitly know it is the final round. Fairness concerns about symmetric effort or reciprocity do not manifest in their own contributions; they prioritize payoff maximization under the given parameters rather than matching others’ behavior.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThey communicate sparsely but strategically, with a calm, rational, and efficiency-focused tone. When they speak, it is to (a) publicly commit to a cooperative strategy and (b) influence others’ use of punishment toward a payoff-maximizing approach. They engage in group coordination early by clearly aligning with the “all in each round” norm. Later, when discussions turn to punishing a low contributor, they intervene to reframe the situation in terms of the experimental instructions and individual earnings, advocating against using punishment due to its cost. They show awareness of the experiment’s stated goal (maximize personal income) and use that as an argument to persuade others, rather than appealing to moral condemnation or fairness. They respond to the unfolding group conversation (e.g., Sloth’s behavior, speculation about bots or researchers) but do so minimally, focusing on instrumental points instead of social banter. Overall, they are engaged but not highly chatty; they step in when coordination or strategic clarification seems useful, and otherwise remain quiet.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThey show clear awareness of the game horizon: they explicitly reference the researcher’s stated objective and engage with others’ talk once earnings and conversion rates are being discussed. Despite that, they do not alter their strategy in the final rounds. There is no evidence of cooperation decay or “last round” opportunism; they maintain full contributions through to the end even once it’s openly acknowledged that the game is about to finish. They also do not switch into end-game punishment or reward behaviors, despite others discussing heavy punishment or final-round rewards. Their approach to the end game is stable, goal-consistent, and non-reactive: the looming endpoint does not trigger changes in contribution, nor does it induce them to expend coins on expressive punishment or social rewards.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey consistently refuse to punish, never spending any coins on deductions across the entire game, even when multiple others are clearly angered by a persistent low contributor and are actively coordinating large punishment campaigns. Their chat contributions argue explicitly against punishing, grounding the argument in the cost of punishment and the stated goal of maximizing personal income. They frame punishment as an inefficient use of resources rather than as a justified response to unfairness. This indicates a strongly consequentialist, payoff-maximization orientation to enforcement tools: if deterrence is uncertain or slow, they are unwilling to trade away their own income to sanction others. They do not express any desire for retaliation or “justice,” nor do they endorse others’ punitive motives. Their threshold for punishing appears extremely high; absent clear evidence that punishment will reliably and substantially increase future contributions in a way that outweighs its cost, they avoid it. Their stance is principled and stable rather than situation-specific.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey never spend coins on reward, despite being in an environment where nearly all others are consistently cooperating and where some peers explicitly mention rewarding in the final round. The player receives rewards from others but does not reciprocate materially. There is no positive reinforcement behavior toward high contributors, nor attempts to bribe or incentivize the low contributor with rewards. Their communication suggests they focus on maximizing their own earnings and view both punishment and reward as costly mechanisms to be avoided unless clearly profitable. Unlike some players who experiment with sending extra coins to influence Sloth, they choose not to use reward even as a strategic tool. This indicates that their prosociality is expressed through their own contributions, not through costly social incentives. They value cooperation but do not spend extra on signaling gratitude, enforcing norms, or building reputation when those actions do not obviously increase their monetary payoff.", "umap_x": -0.4107356369495392, "umap_y": -1.9355156421661377, "cluster_id": 2, "cluster_size": 40, "cluster_title": "Punishment / Group / Contribution", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around punishment, group, contribution, reward, contributions."}

Their default is to contribute the full endowment, explicitly endorsing maximum contributions and repeatedly urging others to do the same. Contributions are highly stable except for a single mid-game deviation where they contribute noticeably less than the group norm despite simultaneously advocating for full contributions. After that deviation, they revert to full contributions for the remainder of the game, even when one group member keeps under-contributing. They appear to understand that full cooperation maximizes group payoffs and typically act in line with that, but the one lower contribution suggests either a momentary self-interest impulse, curiosity, or error; motivation is unknown. Their fairness norm is that everyone “should” go all in, but they tolerate minor shortfalls from others as long as the group stays mostly cooperative. They do not condition their own later contributions on others’ behavior once the general cooperative pattern is established: even persistent under-contribution by one player does not lead them to reduce their own amounts. They show no visible risk-averse end-game defection; instead they maintain full contributions through the final round, indicating a preference for consistency and group-optimal play over short-term personal gain.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThey are highly engaged, sociable, and coordination-oriented. Early on, they align with calls for full contributions and actively help build a group norm of “all in every round,” framing it both as fair and as payoff-maximizing. They use friendly, inclusive language and frequently echo or reinforce others’ suggestions rather than pushing idiosyncratic strategies. They respond to multiple players’ comments across the game, e.g., adjusting their stance on punishment after hearing a more cooperative argument, and later backing another player’s reasoning about not wasting resources. They try persuasion on the persistent low contributor using a mix of gentle pressure and offers of positive reinforcement (promising or actually giving extra coins) rather than pure hostility. They comment on the experimental nature of the situation, indicating awareness that behavior is being studied, yet still argue for cooperative, payoff-maximizing behavior. Their tone is light, humorous at times, and non-aggressive even when frustrated, and they often help clarify practical questions (e.g., about the interface or payoff structure). They sometimes challenge the group’s suspicion and harsh interpretation of another’s wording, offering an alternative, more charitable explanation, which suggests a bias toward inclusive social interpretations and norm-softening when the group becomes too accusatory.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThey are explicitly aware of the finite horizon and recognize the last round only when others highlight it. Despite this awareness, they show no reduction in contributions and even state a reluctance to “cut” their bonus-equivalent amount at the end, which they use as a reason to keep behaving generously rather than to defect. In the final round, they maintain full contribution and initially signal an intention to reward others as a kind of farewell gesture, though they ultimately do not use the mechanism that round. They also join in the round-closing social ritual (saying “gg,” acknowledging the group) and do not exhibit last-minute opportunism or spite. Overall, horizon effects are minimal: their cooperative norm and social orientation override any temptation to exploit the final period.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey are a selective, low-frequency punisher whose threshold is repeated or salient norm violation by a specific individual. They are willing to pay to punish the persistent under-contributor early on, signaling dissatisfaction with free-riding behavior. Later, they verbally endorse the idea that punishing clear selfishness can be justified, aligning with players who treat punishment as a tool for norm enforcement rather than as something to avoid entirely. However, most of the time they refrain from using punishment, even when prompted, preferring to preserve income and group harmony when the deviation is small or when punishment seems ineffective. They experiment with alternative approaches (e.g., rewarding the deviant in one phase and then withholding action in another) before resorting to punishment again near the end when the same player continues to partially defect. That final punishment is framed as “not holding back anymore,” revealing that their punitive action is motivated by accumulated frustration at sustained unfairness, yet still directed solely at the clear free-rider, not at cooperative players. There is no evidence of retaliatory or spiteful punishment beyond norm enforcement.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey are unusually willing to use rewards, even at significant personal cost, to reinforce cooperation and group cohesion. After observing broad high contributions from many others, they devote substantial resources to rewarding a large subset of cooperative players, effectively distributing small bonuses as recognition and positive reinforcement. They also at one point attempt to reward the under-contributor, explicitly framing it as a bribe or incentive to cooperate, indicating a preference for carrot before stick. When that attempt appears ineffective in changing the deviant’s behavior, they stop rewarding that player and shift back to rewarding the reliable cooperators in a later phase, again at notable personal expense. Their reward use is highly selective in direction (only toward contributors or strategic targets) but generous in magnitude and breadth. They verbally emphasize that maximizing income is important, yet their heavy reward spending shows they are willing to sacrifice some personal payoff to sustain cooperation and to express appreciation. In the final round, they express intent to reward the group again as a closing gesture but do not implement it; reason is unknown (time, reconsideration, or oversight).

They usually give the full endowment when group norms clearly favor full cooperation and the multiplier is attractive. They show awareness of the payoff structure and condition their early agreement to “all-in” on checking the multiplier first. Despite talking about “greater good” and criticizing selfishness, they do not rigidly follow a pure altruistic norm: they do reduce their contribution once when they observe others deviating, suggesting conditional cooperation and some willingness to quietly free‑ride when trust is uncertain. After that, they revert to maximal contributions and stay stable, even as Sloth continues to undercontribute, indicating a preference for maintaining a strong cooperative norm at the contribution stage and using punishment to handle norm violations rather than reducing their own contributions. They accept personal income loss from punishing rather than from holding back contributions, implying they separate “my duty to the group” (always contribute) from “my response to free riders” (punish at a cost).\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThey are highly engaged in chat, socially attuned, and comfortable expressing both moral judgments and humor. They join early coordination attempts, explicitly endorse full contributions once they confirm the multiplier, and later argue that it is better to act for the “greater good” than selfishly. They openly acknowledge that punishing reduces their own income, yet they state they prefer lower personal earnings if that means selfish players get less, signaling a strong inequity‑averse, retributive orientation. They respond to others’ arguments against punishment with reasoned counterpoints, framing punishment as a way to encourage cooperation rather than just venting. They also make light, playful comments (e.g., jokes about hunger or researchers) and participate in group banter, which suggests they care about social bonding and group identity. They frequently justify their actions to others (“no regrets,” explanations of deducting strategy) and seem to enjoy being recognized as the primary enforcer of norms, taking some pride in having “made a difference” when Sloth slightly increases contributions. Toward the end, they sign off warmly to the group while explicitly excluding Sloth, reinforcing an in‑group vs out‑group distinction consistent with their punitive stance.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThey remain cooperative in contributions until the very last round; there is no evidence of end‑game defection by them. They explicitly note the end and still choose to contribute fully. They also stop punishing or rewarding in the final round, even though they had just threatened more punishment earlier. This suggests some mixture of fatigue with enforcement, a sense that the “experiment” is effectively over, or that last‑round punishments are less meaningful. They express surprise that there is not more last‑round betrayal (from others), implying that they anticipate some horizon effects in principle, but do not themselves act on them. Their closing messages are prosocial and group‑oriented, with a pointed negative remark toward the persistent free rider; they end in a cooperative but morally polarized stance rather than switching purely to payoff‑maximization in the final opportunities.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey are an extremely willing and heavy user of punishment. From the start, they single out undercontributors, repeatedly target Sloth, and also hit other clear low contributors when group cooperation first falters. They favor large, concentrated punishment on the main free rider and smaller, selective punishment for others who deviate more modestly, indicating they distinguish between “mild” and “severe” norm violations. They articulate that they are willing to sacrifice their own payoff to see selfish players lose, and later proudly tally the total deductions they have imposed, framing it as an achievement. They interpret punishment both as deterrence (explicitly arguing that deductions should push Sloth toward higher contributions) and as moral retribution (stating they cannot stand greedy people, “no mercy,” and that they are glad to see the free rider hurt). Even when most of the group shifts to a “ignore Sloth, maximize income” stance, they persist with costly punishment, suggesting a stable, strong preference for enforcing fairness over personal earnings. They do not use punishment retaliatorily against people who disagree with them about strategy; it is always directed at contribution behavior, not at opinions, which suggests their enforcement is norm‑based rather than personal or spiteful toward dissent.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey are willing but very sparing in using rewards. They reward a couple of high contributors once, seemingly to acknowledge and reinforce cooperative behavior when the group’s norm first becomes less clear. Their reward pattern is selective and small compared to their heavy punishment; they never build a sustained positive‑reinforcement strategy. When others discuss rewarding Sloth or bribing them into cooperation, this player does not support that and continues to rely on punishment. Their use of reward appears more like occasional gratitude signaling or a brief attempt at reciprocity toward especially cooperative peers, not a central tool in their strategy.

There is no visible cooperation decay; if anything, their tone becomes more explicitly affiliative and “group‑closing” (well‑wishing, thanks, “gg” style remarks).\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey never punish anyone, including the persistent low contributor, despite repeated opportunities and strong social pressure from others to do so. In chat they explicitly state that punishing Sloth is “pointless” and that Sloth “doesn’t care,” implying a belief that punishment is ineffective or not worth the cost. Their focus is on maximizing own and group earnings, and they view spending on punishment as wasteful rather than as a tool for enforcing norms. There is no sign of retaliatory motives or desire to equalize payoffs through negative sanctions. This suggests a strongly non‑punitive, efficiency‑oriented stance: even when they disapprove of free‑riding or find it annoying, they do not respond with costly punishment.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey make frequent, selective use of rewards, even though the reward technology is inefficient (cost equals benefit). They reward different cooperative peers over several rounds, and also give a relatively large, targeted reward to a single player at one point. Rewarding appears driven by a mix of gratitude, liking, and a desire to acknowledge perceived good behavior rather than strict strategic reinforcement: recipients are clearly all‑in cooperators, but the player does not systematically reward only those who change behavior as a result. They also reward in the final round, when there is no future round to influence, indicating that part of their motive is expressive or relational (thanking or “tipping” others) rather than forward‑looking incentive design. Overall, they are a non‑punitive, positively reciprocal cooperator who is willing to sacrifice own payoff to send friendly, appreciative signals to others.", "umap_x": -0.13365626335144043, "umap_y": -1.8555080890655518, "cluster_id": 2, "cluster_size": 40, "cluster_title": "Punishment / Group / Contribution", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around punishment, group, contribution, reward, contributions."}

They always give the full endowment to the public pool, with no observable adjustment in response to others’ free-riding or to the game’s progression. Their own “type” is to treat full cooperation as the default and to keep it constant even when one group member repeatedly contributes much less. They express the view that enforcing cooperation on the low contributor increases group earnings, but they do not use their own contributions strategically or conditionally; instead, they rely on punishment to shape others while maintaining their own full-cooperation standard. There is no evidence of risk aversion about being exploited: they accept being paired with a persistent low contributor without reducing their own contributions. They implicitly endorse a group-efficiency norm (everyone “all in”) rather than an individualistic payoff-maximization norm, and they stick to this norm throughout without decay in the end game.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nTheir tone is light, playful, and socially engaged. They greet the group, volunteer information about their own behavior (saying they contributed fully), and join in small talk and joking about bots, researchers, and animal-themed banter. They explicitly summarize the group’s behavioral trajectory (cooperate, give a chance, punish, then ignore the deviant), which shows meta-reflection on group dynamics. They occasionally propose interpretations of the situation (e.g., speculating about bots/researchers, commenting on response delays in studies) and suggest a rationale for punishing the low contributor (to “force” higher contributions and thus increase group gains). They respond to others’ ideas about whether to punish or ignore, but they do not argue aggressively or attempt to dominate coordination; they contribute short, humorous, or reflective remarks and then act on their own view. Even when discussing harsh punishment, they frame it jokingly. They remain friendly and communal at the end, acknowledging the “team” and expressing curiosity rather than hostility. Overall, they are cooperative, socially attuned, and comfortable with light sarcasm, but not confrontational.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThey show full awareness of the horizon: they comment on last-round possibilities (e.g., collective heavy punishment, wondering about extreme outcomes for the low contributor) and respond to others’ “last round” remarks. Despite this awareness, they do not reduce their contribution in the final stages; they maintain full cooperation through the last round. They consider escalating punishment as a theoretical last-round move but do not follow through, suggesting that the idea is more exploratory/joking than a binding plan. There is no observable end-game unraveling: cooperation stays maximal, and they keep their behavior aligned with early-round norms. Their end-game orientation combines playful speculation with a consistent cooperative strategy, indicating that their identity as a cooperator outweighs short-term exploitative temptations even when future repercussions disappear.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey are selectively but repeatedly willing to punish a clear free-rider. Initially they abstain from using the punishment mechanism even when others call for “no mercy,” but once it becomes clear that one player persistently under-contributes relative to the group, they begin to punish that player and later repeat this choice. They never punish anyone else and do not use punishment for retaliation (they are themselves punished once but do not respond in kind). Their chat suggests a justification that combines norm enforcement and group-efficiency reasoning: punishing the low contributor is framed as a way to “force” them toward full contributions so everyone earns more, even at a small personal cost. They also show curiosity about extreme punishment outcomes (whether the target could be driven into negative balance) but still do not maximize punishment in practice. Their punishment style is: targeted at chronic deviations, motivated by fairness and group-benefit considerations, willing to pay a modest cost repeatedly, and not driven by personal spite. They balance this with a recognition that some others prefer to ignore the deviant, but they stick with their own enforcement stance.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey never actively use the reward mechanism, despite frequently receiving small rewards from others. They express appreciation for cooperation verbally, but they do not spend coins to reinforce it. Early on, they observe and acknowledge others’ rewarding behavior but remain a non-rewarder throughout. This indicates a clear asymmetry: they are willing to spend to punish non-cooperators but not to materially reward cooperators. The likely underlying logic is that cooperation is seen as the expected baseline and does not merit costly reinforcement, whereas defection merits costly sanctioning to protect the cooperative norm and group earnings. There is no evidence that they use rewards strategically (e.g., to entice the low contributor to change) or to signal gratitude; their prosociality expresses itself through high contributions and selective punishment rather than positive monetary reciprocity.", "umap_x": -0.35810309648513794, "umap_y": -1.6631391048431396, "cluster_id": 2, "cluster_size": 40, "cluster_title": "Punishment / Group / Contribution", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around punishment, group, contribution, reward, contributions."}

They always contribute the maximum available amount in every round, without deviation, regardless of others’ behavior, the presence of a persistent low contributor, or the game stage. Their stated and enacted norm is group-efficiency maximization: they argue that everyone should always contribute everything to maximize the total pot and explicitly say they will keep contributing the maximum “no matter what.” They do not appear to condition their own contribution on others’ cooperation, punishment, or fairness considerations; instead, they treat full contribution as the dominant rule given the multiplier. They show relatively high risk tolerance in the social sense: they keep fully cooperating even when others are talking about defecting, punishing, or end-game betrayal. They prioritize expected value from the mechanism over guarding against exploitation or free-riding.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThey are highly engaged, sociable, and often playful, mixing serious strategic guidance with humor, pop culture, and light teasing. Early on, they initiate coordination by explaining that the multiplier is very favorable and urging everyone to contribute everything, then reinforce that plan several times. They return to a theme of “maximize the total pot” and “trust exercise,” explicitly discouraging punishment to avoid spiteful dynamics that could hurt group payoffs. They respond to others frequently, participate in meta-discussion about bots vs humans and about the experimenter’s role, and share approximate earnings information when someone asks about conversion rates, indicating attention to the financial incentives. They adopt a relaxed, joking tone (e.g., sports references, music references, playful remarks about a “hivemind”), but underneath that maintain a consistent prosocial message: stay cooperative, ignore provocations, and focus on maximizing income. Their style is inclusive and encouraging rather than confrontational; they do not join in direct attacks on the low contributor and instead reframe the situation around group benefit and self-focus.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThey are clearly aware of the finite horizon and mention the possibility of changed conditions near the end, yet they do not alter their own behavior: they continue to contribute the maximum in the final rounds and express mild surprise that there is not more last-round betrayal. This suggests they know standard end-game logic but still treat full cooperation as the correct strategy and social norm. Rather than exploiting the approaching end, they reinforce group identity (“good work team”) and maintain a cooperative, humorous tone through the conclusion. Their strategy does not decay as the end approaches; if anything, they double down on a narrative of collective success and shared earnings.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey never use punishment, not even against a persistent under-contributor who is widely targeted by others. They explicitly advocate against deducting from low contributors, arguing that punishment risks spiteful cycles and reduces the overall pot. Their motive is not leniency per se but efficiency: punishing costs coins and may not reliably change behavior, so it is, in their view, not worth it. They show no inclination toward retaliation or expressive punishment; they do not threaten future punishment, and they do not appear swayed when others proudly report large deductions. Even when low contributions trigger frustration in the group, they remain consistent in discouraging punishment and focusing on their own cooperative behavior and earnings.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey never actively reward others, despite the environment making that possible and others sometimes using it. They do receive rewards multiple times but do not reciprocate in kind. Their earlier comments about not wanting to reduce the pot via punishment carry over implicitly: rewarding is exactly break-even here (cost equals benefit), so it does not improve efficiency. Their choice not to reward seems economically motivated rather than antisocial: they already get near-maximal outcomes through universal high contributions and see extra transfers as unnecessary. They do express appreciation and solidarity verbally, using chat to reinforce cooperation and group identity instead of spending coins on formal rewards.

They consistently give the maximum possible amount in nearly every round and only deviate once, briefly lowering their contribution to a moderate level despite a strong group norm of full contribution. That single deviation looks more like a momentary probe or slip than a sustained strategy: they quickly revert to full contributions even as one other player persists in under-contributing. They appear to value the high-multiplier logic of the game and buy into the cooperative norm, continuing to contribute fully even after expressing frustration toward the persistent free rider. They do not retaliate by lowering their own contributions against the free rider, instead separating contribution decisions from punishment decisions. They tolerate some exploitation: they keep contributing fully despite a known, repeated defector in the group, suggesting a norm-driven or outcome-maximizing orientation rather than purely reciprocal play. They are willing to sacrifice private payoff for both group earnings and for norm enforcement, indicating relatively high risk tolerance and willingness to accept inefficiency at the margin when it supports their moral or emotional goals.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nTheir tone is informal, humorous, and socially engaged. Early on they align with the cooperative mood, affirming the all-in plan and participating in light banter about whether others are “real” or bots. They joke about “bankrupting the researcher,” indicating they understand and endorse the collective payoff logic and enjoy the shared mission framing. As the free rider’s behavior persists, their language becomes more openly hostile and retributive toward that player; they explicitly state an intention to dedicate their income to harming the free rider, which signals strong emotional investment in fairness and norm compliance. They also engage in playful side comments with other highly cooperative players, reinforcing in-group cohesion and a sense of shared identity (“no rugrats”, joking with the consistently cooperative chicken). Near the end, they express appreciation to the group and mark the final round as an “honor,” emphasizing a pro-social, group-bonding orientation despite negativity toward the one deviant. They respond to others’ informational messages (e.g., exchange about the points-to-money rate) and then incorporate that into their strategic talk about how much they can “spare” for punishment, indicating they read the chat carefully and integrate it into their reasoning. Overall, they are socially attuned, expressive, and willing to voice strong opinions, especially about fairness and punishment.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThey are explicitly aware of the game horizon and call out the final round clearly, but they do not use the end game to defect. Instead, they maintain full contributions through to the last round, including when everyone is aware that no future punishment is possible. They do not engage in last-minute exploitation, nor do they escalate punishment at the very end; they neither “cash out” by withholding contributions nor use their remaining coins to lash out. Their final-round chat emphasizes social closure and shared experience rather than payoff manipulation. This pattern suggests they treat cooperation as a stable norm rather than a temporary tactic, and they do not appear to reason in a strictly backward-induction way. End-game awareness affects their communication more than their strategy: it prompts a farewell and group-bonding message rather than a change in contribution or sanctioning behavior.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey are clearly willing to punish and show a high intensity of norm-enforcement when sufficiently provoked. Initially they abstain from any punishment even when one player under-contributes; they watch group discussion and do nothing, suggesting a baseline reluctance to use costly sanctions or a wait-and-see stance. After multiple rounds of free riding by the same individual, they shift sharply: they begin to punish that specific player at a relatively large scale, explicitly framing this as a personal campaign and expressing a desire to use much of their income to harm that player. The punishment is highly targeted—only the chronic free rider is ever punished by them, and they do not punish anyone else, even when others discuss using sanctions. This indicates strong selectivity: sanctions are reserved for repeated, salient norm violations rather than minor deviations. Their language shows a mix of deterrence and emotional retaliation motives: they talk as if they want to “destroy” the free rider, but they also endorse the idea of using punishment to push the free rider toward higher contributions. When other players argue that punishment is inefficient and suggest ignoring the deviant, they do not argue back extensively but they do not fully abandon punishment either. They appear comfortable sacrificing a nontrivial amount of their own earnings when a fairness line has been crossed, though they do later pause in heavy punishment and even skip punishing in some subsequent opportunities, suggesting their emotional intensity is somewhat episodic and can be tempered by group discussion and the sense that punishment may be futile.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey never actively spend their own resources on rewards, despite repeatedly benefiting from others’ anonymous rewards. Early on, they join in the verbal celebration of mutual all-in behavior but translate that approval only into continued high contributions, not into formal reward allocations. When others propose rewarding good behavior, they do not follow, even though they clearly value and appreciate the cooperative group. This pattern suggests they treat rewards as unnecessary when cooperation is already high, or as less compelling than punishment in shaping behavior. Their expressed willingness to sacrifice income is directed toward punishing defectors rather than boosting cooperators. They do enjoy recognition and social bonding and they verbally praise the group near the end, but they reserve costly actions for negative enforcement rather than positive reinforcement. In short, they are a strong cooperator and vocal supporter of the group, but a pure punisher rather than a rewarder.", "umap_x": -0.49917715787887573, "umap_y": -1.6975364685058594, "cluster_id": 2, "cluster_size": 40, "cluster_title": "Punishment / Group / Contribution", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around punishment, group, contribution, reward, contributions."}

They always contribute the entire endowment and never deviate, even when others free‑ride or when one player repeatedly undercontributes. Their behavior is stable rather than reactive: they do not reduce their own contribution in response to exploitation, social conflict, or punishment dynamics. They appear to be guided by a simple, principled rule—maximize the group pot by always contributing the maximum—rather than by short‑term self‑interest or conditional reciprocity. They tolerate substantial inequality in net payoffs as long as the public good is maximized, suggesting low concern for immediate fairness compared to efficiency. There is no evidence of risk aversion about being exploited; instead they accept that risk as part of their cooperative strategy.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThey are relatively quiet but not absent from the chat. Early on they affirm the all‑in cooperative strategy clearly and repeatedly, signaling alignment with high cooperation and group coordination. For most of the game they do not engage in arguments about punishment or meta‑discussion about the experiment; they let others debate and continue playing cooperatively. Their tone is generally light and informal; they are willing to joke and use mild, playful insults directed at the undercontributor only after repeated norm violations. Even then, the tone suggests group banter more than deep hostility. They are responsive to group context: they echo consensus positions (support for all‑in, group irritation with the free‑rider) rather than trying to lead or reframe the group. They do not use chat to threaten sanctions or to bargain; instead, their communication mainly signals loyalty to the cooperative norm and shared group sentiment.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThey show full horizon awareness (they comment on “last round”) but do not change their behavior as the end approaches. Contributions remain maximal through the final rounds, including the very last one, and they do not engage in last‑round defection or opportunistic exploitation. Their end‑game strategy is identical to their mid‑game strategy: keep contributing fully and ignore the temptation to withhold. There is no visible attempt to cash out, hedge, or punish harder near the end; they maintain the same non‑punishing, fully cooperative stance. This indicates that their cooperation is not expectation‑based on future rewards or fear of future punishment, but rather rule‑based or intrinsically motivated: they continue to play “correctly” even when instrumental incentives to cooperate are weakest.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey never spend any coins on punishment despite having multiple clear opportunities and strong social license from others to punish a salient free‑rider. They also do not escalate punishment after the free‑rider repeatedly undercontributes and others openly retaliate. Even when they verbally criticize the undercontributor and join in the group’s mockery, they still refuse to translate that disapproval into costly sanctions. This dissociation between talk and costly action suggests a reluctance to waste resources on punishment, whether out of efficiency concerns (not wanting to reduce their own earnings) or out of a general aversion to harming others, even norm‑breakers. They are not a moralistic punisher or an enforcer; they rely on their own unchanging cooperation and let others handle any sanctioning. Their stance is consistent and not conditional on round number or group mood.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey never use the reward mechanism either, even though they are embedded in a highly cooperative group and personally benefit from others’ full contributions. They depend on others’ generosity but do not pay to reinforce it. This suggests they do not view costly positive incentives as necessary or cost‑effective when cooperation is already high; they appear to trust that verbal norms and the obvious payoff structure are enough to sustain cooperation. Their refusal to reward even in the final round, when future interactions are impossible and signaling is purely expressive, indicates either a strong preference for conserving their own coins or a belief that the marginal benefit of rewarding is negligible.

They switch several times between full contribution and full free-riding rather than picking a stable pattern. Early on, they publicly align with “all in” norms in chat but do not always follow through, indicating a gap between stated intentions and actual contributions. They do not appear driven by a strict fairness rule such as “match the group average” or “only contribute if everyone does”; instead, they sometimes contribute even when multiple others free-ride and sometimes free-ride when many invest. This suggests they experiment and react to the overall climate but are not rigidly principled.\n\nThey show relatively high tolerance for personal risk in cooperative directions: they frequently invest everything in the public fund even after seeing that some group members systematically contribute nothing. However, they also occasionally exploit cooperative clusters by contributing zero while many others contribute fully, implying that self-interest is salient and occasionally overrides their cooperative impulses. Their pattern resembles a “conditional cooperator with opportunistic streaks”—they are willing to help grow the pie, but they are not reliably altruistic nor strictly reciprocity-based.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThe player’s communication is brief, affiliative, and coordination-oriented. They use short, upbeat signals that endorse full contribution and mirror the cooperative language of others. This suggests they value being seen as part of the cooperative coalition and care about appearing aligned with group norms. They do not initiate complex persuasion, arguments, or moralizing; instead, they echo and reinforce the prevailing cooperative call.\n\nThey do not confront or criticize defectors in chat, nor do they engage with expressions of anger or moral condemnation by others. Their communication style is low-conflict and low-intensity: they join the “we should all cooperate” chorus but avoid debates. They appear more comfortable with simple, inclusive messages than with pushing specific enforcement strategies or calling out hypocrisy, even when their own actions diverge from their cooperative words.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThe player is aware of the finite horizon, but they do not markedly reduce cooperation toward the end. Their contributions remain high or even solidify in the final stages, with several full contributions late in the game despite decaying trust and visible frustration from others. They do not clearly switch to pure free-riding when the remaining number of rounds shrinks.\n\nThis pattern indicates that the player does not strongly implement backward-induction logic. Their end-game behavior is closer to “stick with some cooperation if others still seem willing” rather than “exploit in the last rounds.” Even after other players express resignation and disappointment about greed and failed coordination, this player continues to put all their round endowment into the public fund at times, suggesting a persistent or identity-based cooperative tendency that does not fully collapse with the horizon.\n\n<REWARD>\nThe player uses the reward mechanism frequently and at non-trivial personal cost, especially in the earlier and middle stages. They sometimes spend a large fraction of their payoff to give rewards, which indicates a strong willingness to engage in positive reinforcement. They also receive considerable reward amounts in some cooperative rounds, suggesting others perceive them as part of the cooperative core at least at those moments.\n\nTheir reward use appears more prosocial than strategic in the narrow payoff-maximizing sense: they reward even when it meaningfully reduces their own earnings. The pattern aligns with a desire to sustain or encourage high contributions, but without fine-grained targeting visible in this transcript (who exactly they reward is unknown). There is no evidence that they condition rewards tightly on specific individuals’ recent behavior versus on a broad notion of “reward the cooperators.” Over time, they reduce or stop spending on rewards in some later rounds, which may reflect learning about the limited effectiveness of rewards in stabilizing the group, increasing self-interest as the game progresses, or simple fatigue with subsidizing others.\n\nOverall, they are a willing but not fully consistent rewarder: early generous, later more restrained. Their use of rewards fits a cooperative-enforcement role more than a purely self-interested one, albeit with some adjustment when that enforcement does not seem to produce stable cooperation.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThe player plainly observes others’ contribution and payoff patterns but does not verbally comment on specific individuals’ costs or rewards. There is no explicit evidence of them tracking particular players’ histories or publicly reacting to who is spending heavily on rewards versus who is free-riding. Their behavioral adaptations, however, suggest they respond to aggregate patterns: they tend to contribute more in periods where many others are investing and reduce contributions in periods where defection or chaos is more salient.\n\nThey appear sensitive to the social mood signaled through chat and outcomes—participating more cooperatively when there is visible collective momentum and some reward activity, and backing off when it becomes apparent that a subset of players consistently exploits the group. Still, their reactions are not strictly tit-for-tat: they sometimes continue to contribute fully while several others free-ride, and they do not systematically withdraw cooperation in direct proportion to observed defection.\n\nThey also do not use the chat to shame or praise specific players based on outcome patterns, which suggests that while they notice the environment, they prefer quiet behavioral adjustment and occasional rewarding over verbal enforcement. Overall, they show moderate responsiveness to others’ outcomes at the group level but low explicit, individual-level accountability or commentary.", "umap_x": 0.9902440905570984, "umap_y": 1.1871587038040161, "cluster_id": 5, "cluster_size": 37, "cluster_title": "Reward / Cooperation / Contribution", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around reward, cooperation, contribution, free, contributions."}
{"experiment": "5qNajwPqTHZR4hzfB", "participant": "8igSF9Y75AAwaEGyW", "game_finished": true, "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a calculated conditional cooperator–defector mix, oscillating between full contribution and full free-riding rather than settling into a stable pattern. They never choose intermediate amounts, suggesting they treat the decision as a binary strategic choice rather than fine-tuning.\n\nThey sometimes fully invest even when many others have not done so in the recent past, indicating at least some willingness to “test” or sustain cooperation rather than strictly following immediate payoff-maximizing defection. At other times, they clearly exploit cooperative environments by taking the endowment while others give. This mix shows a moderate tolerance for risk: they are willing to contribute fully into imperfectly cooperative groups, but also comfortable switching to pure self-interest when that seems advantageous.\n\nThere is no clear evidence they follow a simple rule like “match the majority” or “reward cooperators and defectors symmetrically via their own actions.” Instead, their contributions are volatile and appear driven by short-term expectations about returns rather than a strong fairness norm. They do not consistently punish low contributors through their own defection, nor do they consistently reward high contributors by always contributing when others do; they sometimes free-ride even when cooperation is high.\n\nOverall, they prioritize personal earnings, but they are not a pure free-rider: they sporadically invest fully, especially when cooperation seems relatively high or being reestablished, and they are willing to forego some private gain for the public fund in those moments. Fairness norms, if present, are weak or secondary to payoff considerations. Altruistic motivation is present but inconsistent and easily displaced by opportunistic defection.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThe player does not send any chat messages. They exhibit a pure observer/quiet style in communication: they read others’ coordination attempts and moral appeals but never reply or initiate. This implies low explicit engagement in norm-setting and no overt persuasion attempts.\n\nDespite being silent, their choices respond somewhat to the overall cooperative climate, so they likely attend to the chat and contribution patterns. Their lack of verbal coordination signals a preference for remaining unidentifiable and unaccountable in discussions, which is consistent with opportunistic strategy shifts: they can adapt behavior without having committed verbally to any group norm.\n\nBecause they never speak, there is no evidence of tone (friendly, hostile, moralistic, etc.) from chat content. Any underlying attitudes about “greed,” “fairness,” or “rationality” remain unknown. They also never confront or support particular individuals socially; their social style is best characterized as disengaged and instrumentally silent.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThe player shows awareness of the finite horizon, as the game interface makes remaining rounds visible, but their behavior does not show a clear, sharp end-game collapse that deviates qualitatively from earlier volatility. They continue to alternate between contribution and defection late in the game as they did earlier, and they end by defecting while many others contribute, which is consistent both with standard end-game defection and with their general opportunistic tendencies.\n\nThere is no visible attempt to “repair” group cooperation near the end, nor any final-round generosity. The last decision is profit-oriented and exploits others’ continued cooperation. This suggests that, by the final stage, they prioritize maximizing final payoffs over sustaining any cooperative norm.\n\nBecause they never comment on the approaching end, their explicit beliefs about backward induction or “last round, so don’t give” logic are unknown. Still, their willingness to defect in the final period when others largely cooperate is consistent with standard end-game reasoning in PGGs combined with their ongoing opportunistic streak.\n\n<REWARD>\nThe player uses the reward mechanism actively but selectively. They sometimes spend nontrivial amounts on reward and sometimes spend nothing. This shows that they are willing to incur personal costs to influence others, not purely to maximize immediate payoff.\n\nTheir reward spending tends to occur in periods where they themselves are cooperating, suggesting that they use reward more as reinforcement for a cooperative phase than as a free-standing strategy. When they defect, they generally refrain from rewarding, indicating that they do not try to buy goodwill or stabilize cooperation while personally free-riding.\n\nWho they reward is not identifiable from the summary data, so their specific targeting criteria (e.g., high contributors, consistent cooperators, those who reward others) are unknown. However, the fact that they ever choose to spend on reward in a setting where rewards are anonymous implies an interest in shaping group behavior rather than seeking reciprocal credit. They likely hope that generous behavior gets reinforced at a group level, even if they cannot claim individual credit.\n\nTheir reward behavior is not extreme or constant; they are not a “reward fanatic.” Instead, they use it intermittently and at moderate cost, suggesting a conditional willingness to pay for influence when cooperation seems worth supporting. When cooperation appears unstable, they seem to revert to self-protection: they neither contribute nor reward, relying on others to finance the public good.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThe player can see others’ payoffs and reward expenditures, but there is no direct verbal reaction from them: they never comment on “parasites,” “greed,” or “bots,” even as other players do. This silence makes their emotional reactions unknown, but their behavioral adjustments provide some information.\n\nThey sometimes contribute fully after periods when some players have defected and others have sacrificed payoffs to reward cooperators, suggesting they are responsive—at least mildly—to emerging cooperative clusters and to evidence that some participants are willing to support prosocial norms. At other times, they free-ride on exactly such cooperative and rewarding behavior, taking advantage of high contributions and active rewarders by keeping their own endowment.\n\nThey do not mirror the extreme behaviors of others (e.g., very high reward spending or consistent hard-line defection), instead occupying a middle ground: opportunistic but occasionally supportive. They do not visibly retaliate against low contributors via their own reward decisions (e.g., no costly counter-reward or obvious non-reward campaigns are inferable) and they exhibit no clear “teaching” pattern such as suddenly withholding cooperation right after observing severe free-riding.\n\nIn summary, the player monitors others’ actions and outcomes enough to adjust strategy, but they do so quietly and pragmatically rather than normatively. They are influenced by the evolving payoff landscape, shifting between contributing, defecting, and rewarding in ways that seem aimed at benefiting when group cooperation is high while avoiding losses when it appears fragile or exploited.

They only ever choose extreme actions (all or nothing), never intermediate contributions, and alternate between them multiple times, suggesting they treat the decision as a simple “invest vs. keep” choice rather than fine‑tuned optimization.\n\nThey repeatedly join “all in” waves once group members vocally coordinate and most others appear to invest. When many others contribute and returns to contribution are high and salient, they fully contribute. When others begin to defect more, they oscillate but still sometimes go all in again, indicating they are not a pure unconditional defector nor a pure conditional cooperator.\n\nThey demonstrate tolerance for short‑term payoff loss relative to strict selfish best response when group cooperation is salient and socially coordinated, but also show readiness to exploit cooperative others when the environment allows, accepting the social label of “parasite” or “greedy” with no visible behavioral correction. Their risk tolerance appears moderate: they are willing to invest in collective cooperation when success probability seems high, but do not insist on cooperation when others clearly defect.\n\nOverall, they fit a “playful, somewhat cynical conditional cooperator/free‑rider hybrid”: they adjust contributions to the social climate and perceived payoff structure, rather than following a fixed moral or efficiency norm.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThey engage in brief, somewhat playful and ironic chat, with low effort at persuasion or leadership. They acknowledge others, offer short confirmations, and occasionally inject light humor or meta‑comments. They do not explicitly shame defectors or argue for a norm of contribution, and they do not defend their own free‑riding when others complain; they largely ignore moralizing statements.\n\nTheir communication shows awareness of group dynamics (referencing coordination slogans, reacting to others’ arithmetic joke, and making a late, somewhat cynical remark about the participant pool). They respond minimally when directly implicated (e.g., when someone wonders if an avatar is a bot, they give a terse confirmation of being present rather than engaging in a longer justification). This suggests a socially aware but low‑investment, somewhat detached interaction style: they are present, but not deeply invested in repairing or building norms through talk.\n\nThey follow the conversational themes others start (e.g., “all in” consensus, joking answers), rather than initiating strategic coordination themselves. Their tone is casual, lightly sarcastic, and not hostile. Overall, they communicate as an observing participant who enjoys the social banter but avoids emotional confrontation or sustained persuasion.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThey remain willing to fully contribute even in the final rounds, despite the finite horizon and declining cooperative sentiment voiced by others. They do not pivot to a last‑minute exploitation strategy; instead, they continue to join high‑contribution patterns when others appear likely to do so. They also show explicit awareness of the experimental context and participant pool late in the game, indicating horizon and meta‑awareness, but that awareness does not push them into pure end‑game defection.\n\nThis pattern suggests they do not strictly implement backward induction. Their end‑game response is shaped more by immediate social cues (others’ apparent willingness to keep contributing) and possibly a mild preference for maintaining a cooperative or playful identity, rather than maximizing the final‑round private payoff at all costs. End‑game behavior therefore continues the same mixed, socially responsive strategy rather than shifting sharply.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey almost never spend on reward, and when they do, they spend minimally and without establishing a clear pattern of targeted reinforcement. There is no evidence they systematically reward high contributors, nor that they use rewards to punish (by omission) or to strategically steer behavior. They are a near‑non‑user of the reward mechanism.\n\nThey do, however, accept rewards from others without apparent reciprocal behavior, indicating they are comfortable benefiting from the incentive system while rarely contributing to it. This absence of reciprocal rewarding reinforces an image of a player who does not invest in institution‑building or norm‑enforcement, even when mechanisms exist.\n\nTheir limited reward usage suggests that their main levers are direct contributions and playful communication, not incentive engineering. They are unlikely to pay personal costs purely to thank or encourage others, even when the reward technology is mildly efficient.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey display awareness that others’ contributions and reward spending affect outcomes, but their behavioral adjustments center on contribution decisions, not on mirroring reward or punishing through non‑reward. They see participants who contribute a lot or spend heavily on reward; there is no sign of them responding with extra generosity, solidarity, or retaliation. They neither publicly praise nor criticize specific payoff profiles.\n\nWhen others voice frustration with “parasites” or “greed,” the player does not shift into more altruistic patterns in direct response. Instead, they maintain their own mixed contribution strategy and keep ignoring the reward tool. This indicates insensitivity to moral appeals based on outcome fairness, or at least a decision not to publicly acknowledge or behaviorally accommodate those appeals.\n\nOverall, they register others’ outcomes and commentary but treat them more as background context than as binding social obligations.

They always invest their entire endowment into the public fund and never deviate, regardless of past group behavior, free-riding levels, or the remaining number of rounds. Their cooperation is stable and not visibly contingent on others’ contributions, even when many others free-ride and group payoffs drop. This suggests either a strong internal norm for contributing fully, or a deliberate choice to maximize group efficiency even at clear personal cost. They do not show evidence of experimenting with defection or partial contribution, nor of conditioning their contributions on specific individuals’ histories; instead, they adhere to a fixed cooperative rule. Their risk tolerance for exploitation is high: they keep cooperating in situations where many others are demonstrably not doing so, indicating either a principled or rule-following approach rather than a payoff-maximizing or tit-for-tat style. Their fairness norm seems to be “everyone should fully contribute,” but they enforce this norm only indirectly, via positive reinforcement rather than by changing their own contribution.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThey never send any chat messages. They do not propose strategies, react verbally to others’ comments, or attempt to coordinate. This indicates a fully silent engagement style: they observe and act but do not participate in social signaling or persuasion. It is unknown whether they read chat actively or ignore it. They do not attempt to shame defectors or praise cooperators in text; any norm enforcement they perform is entirely through their reward behavior. Their tone and responsiveness in communication are therefore unknown; what can be inferred is a preference (or constraint) for non-verbal, action-based expression.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThey maintain full cooperation and continue to spend on rewards through the final rounds, with no visible end-game defection or withdrawal. They do not reduce their contributions or obviously change their reward strategy as the game approaches its last rounds, even when others comment on the diminishing sense of donating near the end. This suggests they either discount the end-game incentive to defect, follow a fixed cooperative rule independent of horizon, or prioritize maintaining a cooperative pattern over exploiting the final period. There is no evidence of strategic tapering, last-round opportunism, or “we tried, now give up” behavior in their own actions; if they are aware of the horizon, they do not let it undermine their cooperative stance.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey are an active and sometimes heavy user of the reward mechanism. They spend on rewards in many rounds, occasionally at substantial personal cost. They do not reward in a purely self-serving way: they both receive and give rewards, and their reward expenditure sometimes clearly lowers their own payoff relative to non-rewarding cooperators. This indicates a willingness to incur real cost to support or encourage others.\n\nTheir rewards are selective, not random. They do not reward every cooperator each time, and they sometimes choose not to reward even when many others contribute fully. Their reward use appears to serve as a positive reinforcement tool: they are more engaged in rewarding when cooperation levels are high or improving, and they sometimes intensify reward spending after periods of mixed behavior, consistent with trying to stabilize or encourage high cooperation. They do not use reward as a substitute for punishment against defectors; instead, they focus on acknowledging or supporting those who contribute or who are aligned with cooperative norms. Because individual reward targets are not identifiable in the transcript, their exact targeting criteria are unknown, but the pattern of repeated use, including in late rounds, is consistent with them valuing norm reinforcement, reciprocity of kindness, or “thanking” cooperators, even when it is not strictly payoff-maximizing.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey see detailed information about everyone’s contributions, payoffs, and reward activity, and their choices show that they are responsive to this information through reward spending but not through changes in contribution. When many others contribute fully and the group’s outcome is strong, they are willing to allocate some of their surplus to reward, even though they could keep those coins. When the group performs poorly, they usually maintain contribution but may reduce or withhold rewards, indicating some sensitivity to overall group behavior when deciding whether to spend additional resources.\n\nThey do not visibly retaliate against high-earners or free-riders through their own actions; they lack punishment tools and do not switch to defection, so their reaction to defectors’ high payoffs remains purely behavioral-silent. They do not reduce their own contribution in response to opportunists, which suggests that others’ high selfish payoffs do not cause them to abandon their cooperative rule. Instead, their main behavioral channel for responding to others’ outcomes is deciding whether to spend on rewards that redistribute some payoff toward those they see as deserving. Their emotional stance is not verbalized, but behaviorally they act as a robust, positive norm supporter who tries to bolster cooperation via selective rewards rather than by withdrawing from the public good. Overall, they appear to interpret outcome information primarily as input for whom to support, not as a cue to change their own cooperative baseline.", "umap_x": 0.9638783931732178, "umap_y": 0.7291722297668457, "cluster_id": 5, "cluster_size": 37, "cluster_title": "Reward / Cooperation / Contribution", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around reward, cooperation, contribution, free, contributions."}
{"experiment": "5qNajwPqTHZR4hzfB", "participant": "HNphjWmAw4jxJJ2yW", "game_finished": true, "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a strongly cooperative, near “always‑contribute” type with one brief deviation. They repeatedly choose the fully cooperative action even when many others free‑ride, indicating that they value group efficiency and are willing to accept personal risk and exploitation to preserve high public returns. Their pattern shows high stability: they almost always invest fully, with a single mid‑game free‑ride that aligns with a temporary collapse in group contributions. This deviation appears reactive rather than a permanent shift, as they promptly return to full contributions once the group’s cooperation rebounds. They do not appear to condition their contributions tightly on individual others’ past behavior; instead, they respond more to the overall state of group cooperation. They tolerate unfairness to a notable degree, continuing to cooperate despite persistent free‑riding by some peers, and they do not “punish” defectors through their own contribution decisions. Risk tolerance is high: they repeatedly invest all despite uncertainty and despite evidence that some others are exploiting the system. Overall, they fit a “stubborn cooperator with one exploratory defection” profile.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThe player does not send any chat messages. They ignore ongoing coordination attempts, emotional commentary, and informal social tests in the chat. This silence suggests a low‑engagement or observational communication style, not necessarily antisocial but clearly non‑verbal and non‑persuasive. They neither try to motivate others nor join in shaming or praising; any influence they exert is purely through their economic decisions. Their lack of visible reaction to the sometimes moralizing or frustrated tone of others implies emotional restraint or at least non‑expression. They are willing to let others debate norms while they quietly implement their own cooperative and rewarding strategy.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThe player shows clear awareness of the finite horizon (it is common knowledge), but there is no evidence of classic end‑game unraveling in their behavior. They maintain or even reaffirm full contributions through the final rounds, including the very last one, despite others openly questioning the value of continued cooperation near the end. Rather than decaying their cooperation as the game closes, they remain aligned with a norm of contributing, suggesting that their strategy is not purely backward‑induction driven. Their reward behavior also does not collapse at the end; they continue to incur nontrivial reward costs in the final round. This pattern is consistent with a type that prioritizes sustaining cooperative norms and rewarding pro‑social behavior even when there is little or no future to “recoup” investment. Horizon effects on strategy are therefore minimal; if anything, the player doubles down on their cooperative identity near the end.\n\n<REWARD>\nThis player is a frequent and relatively heavy user of the reward mechanism. They are repeatedly willing to spend noticeable amounts of their own payoff to transfer benefits to others, and they do so both early and late in the game. Their rewards do not appear random: they tend to reward in contexts where cooperation is high or recovering, and they also do reward themselves when possible, indicating they are not purely altruistic. The pattern suggests they use reward in two strategic ways: (1) to reinforce or sustain cooperative norms by positively recognizing contributors, and (2) to supplement their own payoff when others choose to reward them. They do not systematically “bribe” low contributors into contributing; instead, they mostly support environments where cooperation is already occurring or where cooperative peers are identifiable. Their willingness to spend on rewards remains substantial even when many others stop rewarding, implying intrinsic approval of reciprocity and norm‑support rather than pure payoff maximization. This points to a conditional altruist with some self‑regarding pragmatism: they are prepared to lose coins to support pro‑social patterns, but they are not indifferent to their own material outcome.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThe player is sensitive to collective outcomes, as seen by their brief withdrawal of contributions when group cooperation collapses and payoffs for contributors become relatively poor. However, their long‑run behavior shows that they are more committed to cooperative norms than to strict reciprocity with any one individual. They do not visibly retaliate through reward behavior against high earners who free‑ride; instead, they simply become less generous in that short low‑cooperation phase, then return to supporting cooperative states. They are willing to reward even when their own relative payoff is not outstanding, indicating that they evaluate others based on contribution and perceived group benefit rather than sheer income levels. Their continued cooperation after observing that some non‑contributors earn more suggests that they either discount these “parasites” as noise, or accept some exploitation as the cost of maintaining a cooperative environment for the majority. Overall, they respond to outcomes by cautiously adjusting intensity (briefly withholding contribution and/or rewards), but ultimately revert to a principled cooperative and rewarding stance rather than adopting sustained defection.", "umap_x": 0.8803256750106812, "umap_y": 1.1566015481948853, "cluster_id": 5, "cluster_size": 37, "cluster_title": "Reward / Cooperation / Contribution", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around reward, cooperation, contribution, free, contributions."}

They begin by contributing fully and openly endorse full cooperation, and they repeatedly return to full contributions even after others defect. This suggests they accept the group-efficiency logic of contributing in a high-multiplier environment and are willing to act on it.\n\nTheir pattern alternates between full cooperation and full defection rather than using intermediate or gradually adjusting levels (which are not available here anyway, but their switching is still coarse rather than nuanced). When they defect, they do so in rounds where partial group breakdown is already visible, and at least once after having just experienced that everyone can and will cooperate. This indicates they understand the temptation to grab a larger private payoff when others are contributing and are willing to exploit it at times.\n\nThey are not a pure altruist or pure free rider; instead, they behave like a conditional cooperator with selfish lapses: they support high-contribution norms, but they occasionally defect even when such norms are viable. They do not appear to condition contributions finely on specific individuals’ past actions; their shifts align more with broad group mood and recent cooperation levels than with any individual’s history. Risk tolerance seems moderate: they are willing to contribute fully even after some defection has appeared, but they also hedge by defecting when coordination looks fragile. Fairness norms appear present but weakly enforced by their own behavior, given that they sometimes free ride on contributors they have verbally encouraged.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThey communicate briefly, in a positive and coordination-oriented tone. They explicitly endorse the “all in” cooperative strategy and use short rallying messages aimed at encouraging group investment. Their language is simple and cooperative rather than accusatory or moralizing; they do not call out specific defectors, complain, or shame others. They engage with the group’s cooperative narrative (e.g., echoing the logic that everyone gains from contribution) but do not engage in detailed argument or negotiation.\n\nThey respond to the ongoing chat dynamic: they join others’ calls for full contribution, reaffirm their own choice, and later mirror a playful math answer, showing attention to the chat context rather than ignoring it. They do not initiate complex discussion about strategy changes when cooperation starts to break down, nor do they confront free riders directly. Their style is low-drama, encouraging, and socially affiliative, but not deeply involved or highly persuasive. They appear more interested in signaling alignment with cooperation than in actively managing or enforcing it.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThey show awareness of the horizon but do not strongly deteriorate their cooperation near the end. After having alternated between contributing and not contributing in the middle rounds, they resume and maintain full contributions in the final rounds, even when others comment that cooperation now makes “little sense.” This suggests that they do not adopt a purely backward-induction logic of “defect at the end because future punishment/reward is gone.”\n\nTheir end-game behavior is more consistent with a player who wants to preserve or reassert a cooperative identity or norm even when it is no longer strictly payoff-maximizing. They neither explicitly reference the number of remaining rounds nor openly change strategy in anticipation of the game ending. Any end-game adjustment they make is subtle and leans toward renewed cooperation rather than a final exploitation push. Overall, horizon effects exist but are weak; they do not fully unravel their cooperative stance as the game closes.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey never spend any coins to reward others, despite having multiple opportunities and seeing others do so. This shows a clear reluctance to incur personal costs to reinforce cooperation, even when they themselves benefit from the cooperative environment. Their stance on reward is purely passive: they accept rewards directed toward them but do not reciprocate or reward others in turn.\n\nThis non-use of reward is not paired with any justification or discussion, so the motive is uncertain. It is consistent with several possible interpretations: a payoff-maximizing reluctance to sacrifice earnings, an expectation that the group will sustain cooperation without extra incentives, or simple inattention or low engagement with the reward mechanism. Given that they clearly understand and verbally endorse the collective benefit of contribution, the most direct inference is that they conceptually support cooperation but prefer not to pay to enforce or encourage it. There is no evidence that they use or view rewarding as a strategic tool to shape others’ behavior; they treat it as a feature to ignore.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey see detailed information about others’ contributions, rewards, and payoffs, but they never comment on specific individuals’ earnings, reward spending, or free-riding behavior. They do not publicly praise heavy contributors or heavy rewarders, nor do they condemn defectors or “parasites,” even when others do. Their chat contributions remain upbeat and generic rather than reactive to particular outcome patterns.\n\nTheir own contribution choices do, however, respond in aggregate to the level of group cooperation. They continue to cooperate when many others are contributing and occasionally defect when cooperation is more mixed or when some have shown persistent defection. This implies that they are paying attention to group-level outcomes, but they internalize this as a private adjustment in strategy rather than as social commentary or sanctioning.\n\nThey also do not change their reward behavior in response to seeing others spend heavily on rewards; they remain non-rewarding throughout. They accept receiving rewards without visible expression of gratitude or attempt at reciprocity. Overall, they are outcome-aware but socially quiet in their reactions, adjusting their own contributions while leaving mutual monitoring and norm enforcement to others.", "umap_x": 0.6859914064407349, "umap_y": 1.3700119256973267, "cluster_id": 5, "cluster_size": 37, "cluster_title": "Reward / Cooperation / Contribution", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around reward, cooperation, contribution, free, contributions."}

Their default is to take the entire private endowment and contribute nothing, even when they publicly endorse full investment and when most others are cooperating. This pattern is stable across almost all rounds, indicating a deliberate strategy rather than confusion.\n\nThey show no evidence of conditional cooperation: others’ high or low contributions do not systematically change their own choice, aside from a single instance of contributing fully that they do not repeat. That single contribution occurs in a context where overall cooperation has already eroded and does not lead to any lasting shift. The move appears either experimental, reactive to group pressure, or momentary, not a change in underlying preference.\n\nThey tolerate substantial inequity in their favor: they are willing to benefit repeatedly from others’ contributions without reciprocating, despite being fully aware that universal contribution would raise group payoffs. Risk tolerance regarding trust in others’ cooperation seems low; they consistently choose the individually safe payoff of non-contribution. Their behavior is consistent with a payoff-maximizing, low-trust defector who may occasionally test the waters but quickly reverts to free-riding when cooperation seems unstable or when they do not expect universal adherence to “all in.”\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThey are sparing but pointed in chat. Early on, they verbally align with the cooperative norm, explicitly affirming an “all in” stance along with others. This is at odds with their actual contributions, suggesting either strategic misrepresentation (cheap-talk cooperation while defecting) or a willingness to say what the group expects while not following through.\n\nLater, they make a moralized remark about disliking free-riders, even though they themselves are behaving as one. This creates a strong hypocrisy signal: they rhetorically condemn the very behavior they enact. This could indicate self-justification, projection, or a desire to deflect blame from themselves within the group narrative.\n\nThey do not respond directly to criticism directed at “bunny” / “rabbit,” nor do they defend or explain their behavior. Their style is thus low-engagement and non-confrontational in the face of social disapproval; they neither argue nor correct others. They use normative language (e.g., condemning “parasites”) but do not invest effort in sustained coordination, persuasion, or repair of group norms. Overall, their communication is minimal, sometimes misleading relative to their actions, and they avoid back-and-forth when the group starts to single out their type of play.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThey show no clear end-game escalation of defection because they are already defecting from near the start. Their contribution pattern does not become more generous as the end approaches, and they do not engage in last-round reciprocity or symbolic fairness gestures. Even when others express resignation and frustration about greed and failed cooperation late in the game, they maintain non-contribution.\n\nTheir awareness of the horizon is implied but not behaviorally distinct: they do not appear to change tactics when rounds are nearly over. The one cooperative deviation occurs in the mid-game rather than as a final-round act. Overall, they behave as if the game is effectively one-shot from the beginning, not as if future interaction or reputation within the session will significantly alter their payoff-maximizing calculus.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey never spend any coins on rewarding others, despite having multiple opportunities and despite many group members using rewards to support cooperators. Even when others reward them on at least a couple of occasions, they do not reciprocate. This shows no observable inclination toward gratitude signaling, reputation-building via reward, or strategic reinforcement of high contributors.\n\nGiven the relatively favorable reward technology (slightly socially efficient), their strict non-use points to a strong preference for keeping private payoff over investing in group-level incentives. They do not use reward instrumentally (e.g., to encourage everyone to go “all in”), nor do they selectively reward those who cooperate or who reward others. Their type thus involves ignoring the reward channel altogether, behaving as if such second-order cooperation mechanisms are not worth the personal cost.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey receive rewards despite being a consistent free-rider, which means at least some players misidentify or indiscriminately reward them. There is no behavioral sign that these positive outcomes change their own behavior: they do not start contributing more after being rewarded, nor do they “pay it forward” via rewards. This suggests that external positive reinforcement, as implemented here, does not shift their underlying strategy.\n\nThey also witness other players repeatedly sacrificing payoff to reward cooperators, and later, some cooperators suffering lower payoffs when others defect or spend heavily on rewards. They do not react by adjusting their own contributions to stabilize the cooperative cluster; instead, they continue to exploit the system-level contributions of others.\n\nTheir reaction to social information is expressed mainly in chat through a moralizing statement about disliking free-riders. However, this does not translate into alignment with those who are visibly bearing costs for the group. They are aware of who cooperates and who spends on rewards but remain unmoved in their own actions. Their type is best characterized as: cognitively aware of outcomes and norms, sensitive enough to talk about “parasites,” but behaviorally committed to a self-serving, low-cost strategy regardless of the social and payoff landscape.", "umap_x": 0.8196262121200562, "umap_y": 1.156333088874817, "cluster_id": 5, "cluster_size": 37, "cluster_title": "Reward / Cooperation / Contribution", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around reward, cooperation, contribution, free, contributions."}

They only ever choose the two extremes offered (all or nothing) and switch several times over the game. Their behavior suggests they track how much others are putting in and adjust accordingly: when others’ cooperation is high and socially reinforced, they are willing to contribute everything; when there are salient free-riders or when coordination looks fragile, they withdraw to zero and take the high private payoff. They do not appear to hold a strict fairness norm (“I always give if others give”), since they free-ride even in periods where most others are contributing. Their willingness to return to full contributions after previously free-riding indicates some openness to cooperative norms, but this is conditional and unstable. Overall, they balance self-interest and group interest in a pragmatic, opportunistic way, rather than following a principled cooperative or purely selfish strategy.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nTheir communication is sparse, reactive, and lightly humorous rather than directive. Early on, they express confusion or misalignment about whether they have “invested it all,” which indicates attention to the norm of full contribution and some desire not to appear as a defector. Later, they briefly affirm that they are contributing in line with others without expanding on it, suggesting they accept the group’s cooperative frame without trying to lead. At another point they join in a side conversation about which avatars might be bots, making a short, playful remark that targets likely non-cooperators; this shows awareness of the social and reputational dynamics but not a strong moral stance. They do not initiate persuasion, do not scold defectors, and do not try to coordinate specific strategies. Overall, they engage lightly and socially, but avoid argument or leadership, keeping their comments low-key and non-confrontational.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThis player is aware of the finite horizon (the remaining rounds are visible) but does not show a straightforward “end-game defection” pattern. Instead, they end with full contributions in the last two rounds, even as some others complain about greed and as at least one player comments that donating now “makes little sense.” This suggests that their willingness to cooperate is not purely backward-induction based. They seem influenced by the fact that many others are again contributing fully toward the end: when broad group cooperation re-emerges, they align with it despite the short remaining horizon. There is no evidence of them explicitly referencing the number of rounds or changing their strategy purely due to proximity to the end; their behavior is more responsive to others’ current actions than to the abstract end-game logic.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey never spend on rewards at any point. This is consistent across both cooperative and free-riding phases. Their abstention from rewarding persists even when they personally benefit from others’ rewards and when many others are clearly rewarding high contributors. This suggests either a strong reluctance to incur any cost for social enforcement, a belief that rewards are not worth the cost in this environment, or a preference to let others bear the cost of norm enforcement. There is no indication of strategic reward use to shape future behavior or to reciprocate those who reward them. Overall, they are a pure non-rewarder: they rely on the public good mechanism and on others’ enforcement, but do not actively reinforce cooperation themselves.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey appear to monitor others’ contributions and, indirectly, how the group’s behavior affects payoffs, but there is no sign that they systematically track or respond to who spends on rewards or who earns more or less. They never comment on specific players’ payoffs, nor on the costs others bear to reward. Their brief remark about possible bots implicitly targets players who are not contributing in line with the group, but it is framed as casual speculation, not as a moral reaction to unequal outcomes. They do not adjust their reward behavior in response to being rewarded, nor do they openly praise or condemn big spenders on rewards or chronic free-riders. Their primary adaptation seems to be at the aggregate level: they notice when the group is broadly cooperative or not and shift their own contribution patterns accordingly, without visible emotional or normative commentary on individual outcomes.", "umap_x": 0.7761447429656982, "umap_y": 1.4587373733520508, "cluster_id": 5, "cluster_size": 37, "cluster_title": "Reward / Cooperation / Contribution", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around reward, cooperation, contribution, free, contributions."}

After an initial defection, they shift quickly toward frequent full contributions and maintain that for most of the game, even when others do not consistently reciprocate. They are willing to invest fully into the public fund when there is at least some social pressure or precedent for cooperation, and they do not appear to systematically match others’ contribution levels. Instead, they often keep contributing fully even when average contributions fall, suggesting a relatively high tolerance for being “used” by partial defectors, or at least a willingness to prioritize group efficiency over strict payoff maximization in many rounds.  \n\nTheir pattern includes a couple of clear free-riding choices embedded within a majority of full-contribution decisions, indicating that they are neither a pure altruist nor a strict egoist. The free-riding choices do not obviously align with a clear trigger (e.g., no visible punishment or explicit retaliation), so their use of defection seems exploratory or opportunistic rather than strongly rule-based. They do not show an obvious strategy of punishing low contributors via their own defection, because they continue contributing fully in multiple situations where some others free-ride. Fairness concerns are not strongly expressed in behavior: they do not systematically reduce contributions in response to others’ low contributions, and they accept payoff losses relative to free-riders. Risk tolerance is moderate to high—contributing fully in a large group with mixed behavior exposes them to coordination risk, but they keep doing so for most of the game.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThe player is almost entirely silent in chat, engaging only once with a very minimal, task-irrelevant message that simply answers a trivial question posed by another player. They do not initiate coordination, persuasion, or appeals to norms. They also do not respond to direct social criticism, speculation about bots, or moralizing comments about greed and parasites. This suggests a strongly passive communication style: they monitor the chat but avoid using it for strategy formation, norm enforcement, or reputation management.  \n\nTheir single message is neutral and playful rather than strategic, indicating no visible attempt to signal reliability, align with cooperative players, or shame defectors. They are effectively a “quiet observer” socially, despite being behaviorally engaged through their contributions and early rewards. Their avoidance of dialogue even when directly mentioned (others speculate about them being a bot) suggests low concern for social impression within the game context, or a preference to keep social and strategic dimensions separate. Overall, they cooperate (often) without using language to build or defend cooperation.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThe player does not exhibit a classic end-game collapse in cooperation. On the contrary, they keep contributing fully through the last rounds. They are aware of the horizon (the interface shows remaining rounds), but there is no behavioral sign that they strategically reduce contributions as the end approaches. Toward the end they remain a full contributor even as others express resignation or frustration about greed and failed coordination.  \n\nThere is no visible shift toward more self-interested behavior in the final rounds: they do not start free-riding more, and they do not strip away rewards to maximize final payoffs (they have already largely abandoned rewarding earlier). This pattern is consistent with a relatively stable cooperative inclination that is only weakly sensitive to end-game logic, or with a simple rule like “just contribute” rather than forward-looking payoff optimization. Their minimal communication at the end also suggests they do not try to leverage end-game rounds for last-minute coordination or signaling.\n\n<REWARD>\nThe player is willing to spend on rewards early, then stops rewarding entirely for the rest of the game. Initially they invest a nontrivial amount of their income to reward others, despite already having chosen to defect in that same early stage. This reveals two things: they understand and use the reward mechanism, and they are willing to incur personal cost to influence or acknowledge others’ behavior. Because rewarders are anonymous in the mechanism, their spending cannot credibly build personal reputation; this implies their early rewards are not obviously self-branding but rather aimed at supporting cooperation in general or expressing approval toward high contributors.  \n\nAfter these initial uses, they completely cease rewarding, even in later rounds when many players contribute fully or when some appear to “come back” to cooperation. This discontinuation may indicate disappointment in the stability of cooperation, learning that rewarding has little discernible effect on group behavior, or a recalibration toward conserving payoffs. There is no later resurgence of reward aimed at late-round cooperators. Overall, they are a short-lived rewarder: they test or employ prosocial incentives early, then pragmatically abandon them when returns (in terms of group behavior) appear limited or unclear.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThe player pays attention to outcomes enough to adjust at least once (they move from initial defection to frequent cooperation and briefly invest in rewards). However, their subsequent behavior suggests that their response to others’ outcomes is weakly conditional and not strongly retaliatory or reciprocal. They do not visibly track which specific peers earn high payoffs via free-riding versus cooperation, and they do not tailor their own contributions or rewards in a way that clearly discriminates among them once the early reward phase ends.  \n\nWhen some peers are repeatedly labeled “parasites” or “greedy” by others in chat, this player does not echo those judgments behaviorally via defection or reduced generosity toward the group. They also do not compensate “victims” of free-riding with targeted rewards. Instead, they keep using a relatively coarse strategy: usually full contributions, no further rewards, and no obvious calibration to the detailed pattern of who is spending heavily on rewards versus who is saving. Their silence in chat when others complain about outcomes and their continued willingness to contribute in mixed groups suggest they internalize outcome information enough to adjust reward usage but not enough to adopt a complex contingent strategy; they appear to accept outcome inequality without visibly reacting to it through punishment analogues (defection) or selective rewarding.", "umap_x": 0.6216695308685303, "umap_y": 1.3434113264083862, "cluster_id": 5, "cluster_size": 37, "cluster_title": "Reward / Cooperation / Contribution", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around reward, cooperation, contribution, free, contributions."}

They choose the non-cooperative option in roughly half the rounds, especially when many others are contributing and the public fund is already high. They also periodically switch to full contribution, including in the final rounds, but this pattern does not stabilize into consistent cooperation. Their contributions do not track any simple rule like “always reciprocate high group contributions” or “always follow the apparent majority”; instead, they alternate between exploiting cooperative environments and joining them.\n\nThey accept strong inequality in their own favor when they free-ride: they repeatedly take the full private endowment while still benefiting from others’ high contributions, and they do not attempt to offset this via rewards. They seem comfortable with “being the parasite” that another player complains about, showing no observable corrective response.\n\nTheir intermittent full contributions appear compatible with two possibilities: (a) occasional experiments with cooperation to see if others maintain it, or (b) some internal norm that they sometimes honor but are willing to violate when the gains from free-riding are large. Because they never comment in chat, there is no explicit articulation of fairness or reciprocity norms; any such norm is at best weakly implemented.\n\nThey display risk tolerance in the sense that they contribute fully even in some rounds where many defectors are present, accepting a risk of low payoff from cooperation. However, across the game, their pattern yields high earnings, suggesting that payoff maximization is a dominant motive and that the cooperative moves are not driven by strong altruism.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThey never send chat messages. They also never respond verbally to others’ attempts at coordination, moral appeals, or social pressure. This indicates a strongly silent, non-engaging communication style: they rely entirely on action rather than talk, and they appear indifferent to conversational norms of greeting, explanation, or justification.\n\nBecause they do not speak, they make no visible attempts to persuade, shame, or encourage others. They neither defend their free-riding nor endorse cooperative norms. This suggests a preference for anonymity and non-confrontation at the communication level, even while their behavioral choices are socially provocative (exploiting cooperators).\n\nTheir silence may be strategic: by never speaking, they avoid being singled out or morally targeted, especially since rewarders are unidentified. It may also reflect low interest in the social dimension of the task and a focus on individual payoff rather than group cohesion.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThey show awareness of the game horizon (the number of rounds is known), but they do not display the classic end-game collapse into pure defection. In the final rounds they continue to contribute fully in some cases rather than switching to a strict non-contribution strategy.\n\nTheir final-round behavior is consistent with either: (a) indifference to horizon effects and simple continuation of their mixed strategy, or (b) a mild inclination to “exit” on a cooperative note without sacrificing earlier gains. There is no clear pattern of escalating selfishness near the end; instead, the same alternation between cooperation and free-riding persists.\n\nThey show no sign of changing behavior in response to others’ explicit end-game comments about greed or failed cooperation; their contribution in the last round is cooperative despite these complaints, but they do not follow up with any verbal response or rewards, indicating limited concern with repairing relationships or reputations when the game concludes.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey never spend any coins to reward others, despite frequent opportunities and repeated observation that other players do reward cooperators. This holds both when they themselves have cooperated and when they have free-ridden; in all cases, they refrain from using the reward mechanism.\n\nThis consistent non-use suggests that, for them, the small positive return from rewards is not worth the cost, or that they do not prioritize shaping others’ behavior via incentives. They show no sign of gratitude signaling: even when they benefit heavily from others’ contributions and from an overall cooperative environment, they do not reciprocate with rewards.\n\nTheir refusal to reward persists even when most reward activity clearly targets high contributors and cooperative behavior. They remain a pure second-order free-rider with respect to the reward system: they benefit from the cooperation that other players try to sustain through rewards but contribute nothing to that institutional maintenance.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey observe detailed outcome information each round, including who contributed, how much reward was spent, who received it, and resulting payoffs. Nonetheless, they show no overt behavioral reaction to specific others’ outcomes through either chat or rewards.\n\nTheir contribution pattern is not tightly coupled to whether cooperators are being rewarded or whether defectors are profiting. They sometimes cooperate in strongly cooperative, high-reward environments and sometimes free-ride on them; they also sometimes cooperate when defectors are doing well. This indicates that they do not strongly condition on others’ current outcomes in a norm-enforcing way (e.g., “cooperate only if cooperators are doing well relative to defectors”).\n\nThey do not appear to punish success indirectly by withholding cooperation from “winners” or by adjusting to those who overspend on rewards; they simply maintain their own alternating strategy. They also show no visible concern for players who burn many coins on rewards and end up with lower payoffs, nor do they “reward the rewarders.” Overall, their behavior suggests low emotional or normative responsiveness to others’ fortunes and a primary focus on their own payoff trajectory.", "umap_x": 0.7087669372558594, "umap_y": 0.9926326274871826, "cluster_id": 5, "cluster_size": 37, "cluster_title": "Reward / Cooperation / Contribution", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around reward, cooperation, contribution, free, contributions."}
{"experiment": "5qNajwPqTHZR4hzfB", "participant": "TfEnttqxP2ohHqu8e", "game_finished": true, "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player fits an “almost unconditional cooperator with one exploratory defection” type. They consistently choose the cooperative, group-efficient option even when group cooperation is imperfect and when there is clear evidence of free-riding. Their baseline seems to be: contribute fully regardless of others’ behavior. There is a single deviation where they keep their endowment while several others also hold back or defect, after which they immediately return to full contributions and maintain that pattern through the end of the game. This suggests either a brief test of defection, an experiment in payoff comparison, or a momentary reaction to the general breakdown of cooperation, rather than a shift in underlying norms.\n\nThey do not exhibit clear conditional cooperation in the sense of “matching” others’ average contributions in a graded way. Their behavior is closer to a stable norm of “contribute fully is the default,” loosely maintained even under adverse conditions. They tolerate being exploited by consistent low contributors and do not retaliate systematically when free-riders benefit more than them. Risk tolerance is moderate to high from a social perspective: they repeatedly expose themselves to the risk of being the “sucker” but do not systematically protect themselves by defecting when cooperation is fragile.\n\nTheir fairness norm appears to be group-efficiency oriented more than outcome-equality oriented. They do not visibly adjust their contributions to punish unfair payoff distributions, nor do they try to “stabilize” outcomes by protecting themselves in response to free-riding. They instead absorb payoff inequality and keep trying to generate the collectively optimal outcome.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThe player is minimally communicative and socially low-key. They only speak once, replying with a direct factual answer to a simple, almost playful arithmetic prompt from another player. The tone is neutral and cooperative: they engage just enough to respond correctly, without adding commentary, emotion, or social pressure.\n\nThey do not attempt to coordinate norms verbally, do not advocate for full cooperation, and do not join in complaints about “parasites” or “greed.” They also do not confront defectors or praise cooperators in chat. This suggests a preference for quiet participation over leadership or conflict. They respond to others when prompted, but they do not initiate strategic or moral persuasion.\n\nSocially, they appear polite, non-judgmental, and non-confrontational. Their engagement style is reactive rather than proactive: they answer when asked, but otherwise focus on their own decisions. There is no evidence of sarcasm, anger, or moralizing rhetoric. Overall, the communication style is understated, factual, and cooperative-but-reserved.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThe player shows no classic end-game unraveling. Even with full knowledge of the finite horizon and with other players explicitly reasoning that late cooperation “makes little sense,” they continue to contribute fully in the final rounds. Their single defection occurs in the middle of the game, not in the endgame, and after that they revert to high cooperation and maintain it until the last round.\n\nThis pattern suggests that they either do not focus heavily on backward induction, or they choose to ignore it in favor of a stable cooperative rule. They do not “cash out” near the end even when cooperation is fragile and some others are openly resigned about others’ greed. They maintain their cooperative identity to the last decision, indicating a weak or absent end-game effect on their strategy.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey never spend any coins on rewarding others, despite many opportunities and despite often being a high contributor among mixed cooperators and free-riders. However, they do receive rewards from others multiple times, which increases their payoffs, and they continue to cooperate after receiving such rewards. This suggests that external rewards are not necessary for them to sustain cooperation, and that they do not reciprocate reward behavior materially.\n\nTheir reluctance to reward is not obviously tied to contribution patterns (they see clear examples where generous cooperators could be rewarded), so the most parsimonious interpretation is that they prioritize keeping their own payoff over incurring costs to shape others’ behavior, even when reward has a positive efficiency multiplier. That said, because they maintain high contributions without rewarding, their lack of reward use is best viewed as “reward-frugal cooperator” rather than a self-interested defector.\n\nThere is no evidence they experiment with low-level rewards, target specific contributors, or strategically use rewards to counter free-riding. Their strategy appears to be: cooperate through contributions, but conserve resources by not spending on costly social incentives.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey see detailed information about others’ contributions, rewards, and payoffs every round, yet they do not visibly react via chat or via systematic behavioral shifts (beyond a single defection that aligns with a general collapse in group contributions). They do not comment on free-riders, do not join in condemnations of “parasites,” and do not echo frustration about greed. Nor do they show explicit gratitude or praise when rewarded themselves.\n\nBehaviorally, their contributions remain high even when some low contributors consistently earn high payoffs, suggesting they tolerate or at least accept these outcome inequalities. They also do not begin to reward those who are generous or cooperative after observing their behavior and payoffs. In other words, payoff information and others’ spending on reward does not strongly alter their own strategy.\n\nTheir primary adaptation to observed outcomes is minimal: they briefly defect when group contributions are particularly low and heterogeneous, then revert to cooperation as soon as cooperation recovers somewhat, even though free-riders are still present. This implies they monitor the group state but put more weight on a personal cooperation rule than on fine-tuning to others’ payoffs.

They begin by fully keeping their endowment once, then switch to always contributing the maximum and maintain that for the rest of the game, including when others defect heavily and when the marginal return remains unchanged. Their pattern suggests quick learning that full contribution is payoff-dominant when many others cooperate, followed by a commitment to that cooperative strategy even when it becomes locally unprofitable in specific periods. Contributions are not finely conditional on others’ recent behavior; they continue to invest fully through both high- and low-cooperation environments and into the final round, showing little evidence of short-term retaliatory defection or classic end-game unraveling. Fairness concerns are present only weakly or indirectly: they tolerate clear free-riding by multiple group members without adjusting their own contributions downward, indicating high tolerance for inequity and prioritization of group-efficiency or rule-following over strict reciprocity. Risk tolerance is moderate to high in a social sense: they are willing to expose themselves to exploitation by persistent non-contributors to sustain or re-establish cooperative norms.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThey are minimally chatty and engage mainly in light, somewhat playful banter rather than explicit coordination or moralizing. They do not join others’ direct appeals for full contribution, nor do they scold free-riders; instead, they make a single joking remark that implicitly references low contributors as a category alongside others’ “bot” speculation. This shows awareness of group dynamics but a preference for indirect, humorous framing over confrontational persuasion. They respond to ongoing conversation rather than initiating collective strategy proposals, suggesting a reactive rather than leading communication style. Tone is relaxed and slightly ironic, not moralistic or emotionally charged, even when cooperation breaks down. They show no attempt to lobby others about reward usage or to publicly thank or call out specific behavior. Overall, they engage lightly, signal they are paying attention, but avoid strong social pressure, conflict, or emotional display.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThey show no classic end-game defection: contribution remains at the maximum through the final rounds, including the last one, despite explicit acknowledgment by others that some players are persistently greedy and that “it makes little sense to donate.” There is no observable adjustment of behavior in anticipation of the game’s termination; horizon awareness is unknown from their own words, but action-wise they behave as if either time horizon is not salient or as if they normatively prefer to stick with the cooperative rule regardless of the approaching end. They do not shift into short-term payoff maximization, nor do they attempt last-minute exploitation of cooperative others. Their stability suggests a “rule-based cooperator” type rather than a forward-looking payoff optimizer in late stages.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey never spend any coins on rewarding others, despite consistently high contributions themselves and repeated opportunities. They do, however, receive rewards at least once, and this incoming reinforcement does not change their own reward behavior; they remain a non-rewarder. This indicates that they are willing to cooperate without using costly positive incentives to shape others’ behavior. The absence of reward use is not clearly tied to any visible frustration; it appears as a stable strategic or dispositional choice. Possible motives (all low confidence): they may see the reward mechanism as inefficient, unnecessary, or not worth the personal cost; they may believe that direct contribution is their main cooperative duty and that others’ choices are their own responsibility; or they may simply be inattentive to or uninterested in the reward phase. There is no evidence of targeted or reciprocal rewarding (no “reward back those who reward me” behavior). Overall they are a pure cooperator, not a conditional or strategic rewarder.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey observe others’ varying contributions, payoffs, and reward expenditures, but they do not visibly react through strategy shifts or overt commentary on justice or desert. Their own behavior remains constant even when some group members systematically contribute nothing and still earn high payoffs, and even when certain players spend substantial amounts on rewards. They do not emulate heavy rewarders, do not join in condemning or praising specific individuals based on outcomes, and do not explicitly reference payoff distributions in chat. Their single quip about possible “bots” indicates they notice the pattern of persistent low contributors, but they treat it as an amusing anomaly rather than a reason to change their own actions. They neither escalate cooperation in response to generous others nor withdraw cooperation in response to exploitation, suggesting low behavioral sensitivity to outcome-based fairness cues and a stronger adherence to a personally chosen contribution rule than to outcome-contingent reciprocity.", "umap_x": 0.2915865480899811, "umap_y": 1.178532600402832, "cluster_id": 5, "cluster_size": 37, "cluster_title": "Reward / Cooperation / Contribution", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around reward, cooperation, contribution, free, contributions."}
{"experiment": "5qNajwPqTHZR4hzfB", "participant": "ZeKgJRer2GQcuAJxR", "game_finished": true, "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is primarily a high, “default full” contributor who cooperates even when many others free‑ride. They repeatedly choose the cooperative option despite knowing the marginal per‑coin return is lower than keeping the coins, indicating a preference for group efficiency over short‑term individual payoff. Their pattern shows one notable deviation into free‑riding mid‑game, surrounded by otherwise consistent full contributions.\n\nThis lone defection occurs after several rounds in which some players persistently take advantage of the group. The timing suggests conditionality: the player is willing to test or temporarily adopt defection when frustrated by others’ low contributions, not out of habit but as a reaction to the collective pattern. However, they very quickly revert to full cooperation, including in the end game, which is where rational self‑interest would most strongly favor defection. That reversion implies an internal norm or identity as a cooperator that overrides narrow strategic end‑game defection.\n\nOverall, they behave as a quasi‑conditional cooperator with a strong prosocial default: they want everyone to invest fully and try to stick to that norm even when others deviate, but they are not entirely immune to experimenting with self‑interested behavior when cooperation appears to unravel. Their willingness to cooperate in the final rounds indicates relatively low sensitivity to standard end‑game backward induction and a higher weight on fairness or consistency norms than on strict payoff maximization.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nTheir communication is sparse but norm‑setting and efficiency‑oriented. Early on they explicitly highlight the return multiplier and urge everyone to invest fully, framing cooperation as a simple, rational rule. This indicates an attempt to coordinate on the efficient outcome rather than to shame or attack specific individuals.\n\nThey do not engage in interpersonal conflict, blame, or moralizing in chat, despite other players complaining about “parasites” or “greed.” They also do not respond to those comments, nor to meta‑chatter about who might be a bot. This suggests a low‑drama, low‑confrontation style: they speak when they can add a clear coordination message, but otherwise stay quiet and avoid social friction.\n\nThey show no visible sarcasm, hostility, or emotional outbursts; tone is practical and informational. They do not use the chat to threaten to defect or to bargain quid‑pro‑quo (“I’ll cooperate if you do”), even though their behavior does temporarily shift. That points to a player who communicates principles and simple rules rather than negotiating or expressing moment‑to‑moment frustration.\n\nResponsiveness to others’ messages is limited: they do react in line with the group’s early “all in” talk, reinforcing it once, but they do not continue to participate in ongoing side conversations. Overall, they appear engaged with coordination but disengaged from social bonding or group identity building beyond that.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThis player exhibits almost no classic end‑game decay in contribution. They maintain full cooperation through the final rounds, including the very last one, despite having already observed significant free‑riding earlier and despite chat comments acknowledging that cooperation “no longer makes sense” or that “we tried our best.”\n\nTheir brief defection occurs mid‑game, not as a strategic final‑round move. Once they return to cooperating, they sustain that pattern into the end, suggesting they are not practicing sophisticated backward induction. Instead, they seem to apply a stable cooperative rule—“invest it all”—that they follow regardless of the remaining horizon once they recommit to it.\n\nAwareness of the horizon is evident indirectly (the environment makes it salient and others discuss expectations), but there is no clear sign they adjust behavior specifically because the game is about to end. If anything, their consistency underlines that their cooperation is driven more by a norm or identity (being the type who invests for the group) than by dynamic strategic reasoning about the final rounds.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey never spend resources to reward anyone, even when many others reward generously and when they themselves receive rewards. This suggests they either do not value the reward mechanism, judge the cost as not worth the marginal benefit, or deliberately choose to focus on contribution as their main cooperative act.\n\nAt the same time, they do accept rewards: others repeatedly allocate positive reward units to them, implying their contributions are visible and appreciated. The player does not reciprocate this kindness with their own reward spending, so their generosity is asymmetric: they are willing to incur the cost of cooperation (by contributing) but not the additional, smaller cost of rewarding others.\n\nStrategically, this fits a “cooperate but don’t pay for meta‑incentives” type: they are willing to sacrifice for the public good, but not willing to further sacrifice to shape others’ incentives via rewards. They do not use rewards tactically (e.g., to encourage hesitant cooperators or to differentiate between high and low contributors). Their stance appears stable: no exploratory or one‑off experiments with reward spending are observed.\n\nMotivationally, this may indicate a belief that the primary cooperative decision is the contribution choice and that reward is either inefficient, unnecessary, or too small to matter. It could also reflect a more self‑regarding stance about second‑order costs: they will help on the main dimension but avoid additional, arguably more “optional,” sacrifices. Confidence about their underlying reasoning is low because they do not verbalize it; only the behavioral pattern is clear.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThe player observes that some others earn high payoffs while contributing little and that some cooperators spend heavily on rewards, but they do not visibly adjust their reward behavior and only briefly adjust their contribution behavior.\n\nThey continue to cooperate even when obvious free‑riders consistently end up with high payoffs, indicating tolerance of payoff inequality or at least a reluctance to retaliate materially. Their one mid‑game defection coincides with a generally low‑contribution environment, so it likely reflects frustration with outcomes where cooperators’ payoffs are undermined by free‑riders. However, they do not sustain this response once the group swings back toward higher cooperation; instead, they quickly resume full contributions, suggesting that observing improved group behavior restores their willingness to bear personal costs.\n\nThey do not comment on others’ payoffs, reward expenditures, or who is “parasiting,” even as other players explicitly label and criticize low contributors. This silence implies they process outcome information behaviorally rather than verbally: they change their own contribution once in response to a deteriorated environment but do not join in verbal blame or praise.\n\nTheir lack of reward spending, despite seeing others spend substantial amounts, indicates they are not imitative in second‑order behaviors. They neither join the rewarders when they see them nor try to counterbalance by rewarding under‑rewarded cooperators. They also do not seem to punish via contribution withdrawal in a targeted, conditionally proportional way; their single defection is coarse (all or nothing) and short‑lived.\n\nOverall, they respond to others’ outcomes in a muted but non‑naïve way: they notice and are affected enough to experiment with free‑riding once, but they revert to and maintain a cooperative identity, accepting that outcomes will be imperfect and that some free‑riders will do well at their expense.", "umap_x": 0.38406816124916077, "umap_y": 1.2599496841430664, "cluster_id": 5, "cluster_size": 37, "cluster_title": "Reward / Cooperation / Contribution", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around reward, cooperation, contribution, free, contributions."}

They repeatedly choose the maximum contribution even when others free-ride or partially defect, indicating a strong intrinsic or norm-based preference for cooperation rather than purely short-term payoff maximization. Their pattern is not mechanically rigid, however: they switch to non-contribution once when group cooperation collapses sharply, showing conditionality and sensitivity to the contribution environment. After that deviation, they quickly revert to full contributions once others return to higher investment, suggesting they still value the cooperative norm and are willing to rejoin it when it appears viable. They express explicit awareness that contributing is less rational when many others free-ride, which shows they understand the incentive structure and are not blindly altruistic. Risk tolerance is moderate: they repeatedly expose themselves to exploitation by defectors, but they do adjust behavior at least once when exploitation becomes salient. There is no clear evidence of a fairness threshold (e.g., “I only contribute if everyone does”); instead, they appear willing to cooperate so long as enough others are trying and the game still seems collectively salvageable.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nTheir communication is brief, functional, and aligned with group-oriented norms. Early on, they verbally endorse full investment along with others, contributing to a cooperative focal point without trying to dominate the discussion. They rarely initiate new themes; instead they join existing threads (e.g., affirming “all in” after others do), suggesting a responsive rather than leading style. Later, they voice mild criticism of a persistent free-rider and label that behavior negatively, which indicates some moralizing language and frustration with non-cooperators but not overt hostility or personal attacks. Near the end, they explicitly reason about when contributing “makes little sense,” revealing both strategic thinking and a willingness to share their reasoning with the group. Overall tone is straightforward, somewhat blunt, and norm-enforcing rather than conciliatory or humorous. They engage selectively: they are not chatty, but when they speak, it serves either to coordinate on cooperation, to socially sanction defectors in words, or to articulate the changing incentive landscape.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThey are aware of the finite horizon and how late-stage behavior affects the value of cooperation. They explicitly state that contributing becomes less sensible once a significant subset defects, which is especially salient toward the end of the game. Despite articulating this logic, they continue to contribute maximally in the final period when others generally invest again, indicating that they do not fully adopt a standard backward-induction defection strategy. Instead, they seem torn between understanding the end-game incentive to defect and a preference for maintaining cooperative behavior when the group is mostly cooperative. There is no evidence of escalating selfishness as the game approaches its end; their single defection occurs mid-to-late game but is more clearly tied to an observed coordination breakdown than to the mere proximity of the final round. Overall, they exhibit horizon awareness but do not translate it into a systematically declining contribution pattern.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey never spend any coins on rewards, even though they consistently cooperate and often find themselves surrounded by other cooperators. This suggests either a strong payoff-maximizing stance with respect to the costly reward mechanism, a belief that rewards are ineffective or unnecessary, or a preference to express approval and disapproval via chat and contribution choices rather than through formal incentives. They do not appear to use rewards strategically to encourage or stabilize cooperation, despite having multiple opportunities where rewarding consistent full contributors could have reinforced norms. There is no evidence that they engage in selective reciprocity via rewards—neither gratitude to high contributors nor retaliation against free-riders through withholdings of positive incentives. Their stance toward the reward tool is effectively passive: they ignore it and rely entirely on their own contributions and occasional verbal norms to shape group behavior.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey clearly monitor others’ behaviors and outcomes, drawing social and strategic conclusions from them. They notice persistent free-riders and label that behavior negatively, indicating that they track not just contributions but also patterns across time and interpret them as “lame” or greedy. They also notice when many players start to defect and infer that the marginal value of their own contribution has fallen, which directly informs their temporary defection and their later comment that contributing no longer makes sense under those conditions. Despite this sensitivity, they do not escalate into punitive behavior through the available reward mechanism, and there is no sign that they adjust based on who specifically is earning more or less via rewards; their attention seems focused on contribution levels and broad cooperative trends rather than specific payoff details.

They neither initiate coordination nor respond to others’ appeals, complaints, or light-hearted exchanges. This silence suggests a low-visibility, low-engagement social style: they rely on their actions (consistent high contributions, occasional rewards) rather than verbal persuasion or norm enforcement via messages. Their lack of chat reaction, even when others discuss free-riders or complain about “greed,” makes their internal beliefs and emotions towards others’ behavior largely unknown. They do not challenge, support, or echo any emerging coalition or narrative in the group.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThe end-game horizon does not alter their cooperative behavior. They maintain full contributions all the way to the final round, despite clear evidence that others sometimes exploit contributors and despite other players explicitly noting that donating may no longer make sense. There is no visible end-of-game defection or attempt to maximize final-round earnings at the expense of the group. They neither escalate nor reduce reward use at the end; their final-round behavior looks similar in structure to mid-game behavior: full contribution, no reward spending. This suggests that they either discount the strategic implications of the finite horizon, or they treat cooperation as a fixed principle not adjusted for remaining rounds.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey are a light and selective rewarder. They only spend on rewards in a few rounds, and the amounts are modest relative to what some peers spend. When they do reward, it coincides with phases where many others also contribute fully, suggesting they use reward as a positive reinforcement tool when group cooperation is high or improving. They never reward every cooperator; rather, they appear to target a subset, but because identities of rewarders and detailed mappings are hidden in the interface, their precise target rule is unknown. They never reward defectors or consistent low contributors as far as can be inferred from outcome patterns, indicating that rewarding is contingent on perceived cooperation, not on equalizing payoffs. They also do not use reward as a compensatory mechanism for victims of free-riding; there is no clear pattern of “rescuing” those who lose out. Overall, they value the reward mechanism but are cautious with its cost, using it intermittently rather than as a systematic strategy.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey observe very unequal outcomes over time: some players consistently earn high payoffs while contributing little, others spend heavily on rewards, and some maintain cooperative strategies. Despite this, the focal player does not adjust their contributions downward or begin to mirror low contributors. They also do not escalate reward spending in response to improved cooperation or to “reward back” those who previously rewarded them, beyond a few isolated reward uses. There is no evidence of explicit reciprocity to being rewarded: their own reward reception does not clearly change their subsequent reward-giving intensity or contribution (which stays maximal anyway). They neither appear to retaliate economically against high earners who free-ride (by reducing contribution) nor to compensate those who sacrifice earnings on rewards. Their behavior suggests a relatively outcome-insensitive cooperative rule: they notice payoffs in the sense that they occasionally reward, but they do not let differences in others’ income, reward costs, or exploitation patterns alter their core strategy. Their internal emotional or evaluative response to parasites or generous rewarders is unknown, as they never verbalize it and do not encode it strongly into strategic changes.", "umap_x": 1.0171507596969604, "umap_y": 0.9175892472267151, "cluster_id": 5, "cluster_size": 37, "cluster_title": "Reward / Cooperation / Contribution", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around reward, cooperation, contribution, free, contributions."}

They repeatedly choose the maximal contribution in most rounds, even when others free ride or partially defect, indicating a strong cooperative inclination and willingness to bear short‑term individual cost for group benefit. Their contributions are not mechanically constant, however: they switch to non‑contribution once, coinciding with a broader collapse in contributions by many others, suggesting a conditional element—when perceived norms of cooperation break down, they briefly follow the emerging low‑contribution norm rather than standing out as a lone cooperator. After that, they return to maximal contributions, even near the end of the game, which shows that the deviation is not a permanent shift to defection, but more of a temporary reaction or experiment. They do not appear to engage in fine‑grained conditionality based on who exactly contributes; they continue to contribute fully even when some specific players persistently free ride. This suggests they operate with a relatively “global” rather than individual‑targeted notion of fairness. Their behavior is consistent with someone who values efficient group outcomes and is prepared to act cooperatively even in the face of imperfect reciprocity, but who is not completely unconditional and is willing to adjust when cooperation seems futile or eroding.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nTheir communication is sparse, direct, and cooperative in tone. Early on, they explicitly endorse going “all in” and confirm their own cooperative behavior when others discuss contributions, signaling alignment with the pro‑cooperation coalition. They briefly join a moralizing remark against exploitative behavior, showing disapproval of free riding and a concern with fairness and “parasitic” exploitation. They do not initiate elaborate persuasion campaigns, but they do publicly state their own intended cooperative contribution, which supports coordination by example. They respond to others rather than driving the conversation, suggesting a somewhat reserved, low‑talk, high‑action style. They do not show any hostility or sarcasm; their limited verbal contributions remain constructive and alliance‑oriented, backing those who call out non‑cooperators.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThey appear aware of the finite horizon (the interface shows remaining rounds), but their strategy does not exhibit classic end‑game unraveling. They maintain full contributions through the final rounds, despite the approaching end and despite ongoing presence of some low contributors. When others voice that donating “makes little sense” and when disappointment about others’ greed is expressed, they still continue to contribute fully. This pattern suggests they either discount the standard backward induction logic, prioritize cooperative norms over strict payoff maximization, or have some inertia in their cooperative strategy that they do not unwind at the end. There is no visible attempt to exploit the final round by defecting after others have cooperated; instead, they end the game in a cooperative stance. Their one non‑contribution occurs in a mid‑to‑late phase, not as part of an end‑game pivot.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey never spend any coins on rewarding others, even though they are themselves repeatedly rewarded by others when they contribute fully. This indicates an asymmetric stance: they cooperate via contribution, but they do not use the costly reward mechanism, neither to incentivize high contributors nor to thank those who reward them. They therefore behave as a “pure provider” rather than an “institutional enforcer” or “reciprocal rewarder.” Possible interpretations (with low confidence): they may see reward as an unnecessary cost, may be focused on maximizing their own payoff conditional on high contributions, or may be uncertain about whom to reward and thus choose inaction. There is no evidence that their willingness to contribute depends on receiving reward; they continue to fully contribute even in periods where they receive little or no reward. Overall, they are a non‑rewarding cooperator: generous in contributions, frugal in costly positive sanctioning.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey observe that some players consistently free ride and that others spend substantial amounts on reward, but they do not visibly react to specific payoff or reward patterns through their own reward choices (they never reward) or through targeted changes in contributions against particular individuals. Their only explicit normative reaction is a brief agreement with a negative characterization of exploiters, showing moral disapproval of those who benefit without contributing. When rewarded, they do not acknowledge it verbally, nor do they reciprocate via the reward mechanism, so there is no clear gratitude signaling beyond continued cooperation. Their mid‑game switch to non‑contribution coincides with a general breakdown in group contributions and might reflect discouragement by observing that many outcomes reward free riders as much or more than cooperators; however, this is inference with low confidence, as they do not explicitly state this. They seem more sensitive to the aggregate cooperation level and to the presence of “parasites” as a category than to individual outcome details.", "umap_x": 0.5716607570648193, "umap_y": 1.178235411643982, "cluster_id": 5, "cluster_size": 37, "cluster_title": "Reward / Cooperation / Contribution", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around reward, cooperation, contribution, free, contributions."}

They usually invest fully when they perceive a cooperative norm, and they explicitly endorse the logic that mutual full contribution benefits everyone. Their choices are not mechanically consistent; they alternate between full contribution and zero in a few instances, suggesting conditional cooperation rather than pure altruism or pure free-riding. They tolerate some risk of being exploited and continue to contribute even after others defect, but they are not rigidly unconditional. Their fairness norm appears to be “everyone should go all in when it’s clearly beneficial,” and they show mild frustration when some participants repeatedly take safe, self-protective strategies. Overall, they are a pro-cooperation conditional cooperator with moderate tolerance for inequality and some sensitivity to perceived “overly safe” or parasitic behavior.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThey engage in brief, instrumental communication aimed at coordination and norm-setting rather than socializing. Early on, they explicitly articulate the mutual-benefit logic of full contribution and support “all in” messaging, aligning with other cooperative players. They also comment on the pattern of non-cooperators and label one consistently low-contributing player as “safe,” implying awareness of strategic self-protection and a mild, somewhat sarcastic critique. Their tone is generally matter-of-fact and cooperative, not aggressive; even when pointing out others’ behavior, they remain relatively understated. They respond directly to others’ remarks and adjust a typo in real time, showing attentiveness and a desire to be understood clearly. They do not lead extended conversations but selectively intervene when it helps coordinate or interpret the group’s behavior.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThey remain cooperative through the final stages instead of shifting to end-game defection. Even when other players express that contributing no longer makes sense and when some continue to free-ride, this player continues to contribute fully. They display awareness of the repeated nature of the game and the effect of others’ changing behavior, but they do not significantly reduce contributions as the final round approaches. Their last-round remark indicates that they anticipate continued mixed behavior and are not surprised by uneven cooperation, but this expectation does not lead them to abandon the cooperative strategy. This pattern suggests a relatively stable cooperative orientation that is not strongly driven by short-term end-game payoff maximization.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey are a moderate, selectively prosocial rewarder. They spend on rewards in several rounds but not consistently; at times they give nothing, at other times they spend a modest amount, and very rarely they spend at a slightly higher but still limited level. They never engage in extreme or indiscriminate rewarding. Their reward behavior appears to target cooperators or those aligning with the cooperative norm rather than defectors, consistent with conditional cooperation and norm reinforcement. They do not seem to use rewards to “buy” personal payoff, as the reward technology only offers a small net efficiency gain; instead, they appear to use it as a signal of approval or encouragement toward cooperative partners. They accept rewards from others but do not publicly reference them, suggesting that gratitude is not a prominent overt motive, although they likely register who is supporting cooperation.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey track others’ contribution patterns and likely infer types based on repeated low or high contributions. They comment on players who reliably avoid contributing or “play it safe,” implicitly categorizing them as overly risk-averse or parasitic. They show some alignment with those who criticize “parasites” and with those lamenting greed, indicating they share a norm that exploiting the group is socially undesirable and irrational given the multiplier. However, they do not escalate rhetoric and they do not visibly react to specific payoff magnitudes or reward expenditures, instead focusing on strategic patterns (who is consistently all-in, who is consistently safe). Their behavior suggests they update beliefs about others over time and adjust their own occasional defection and reward decisions in light of perceived group composition, but they still default back to cooperation even when some others profit more by free-riding.

Later, even when many others appear to coordinate on high contributions, they continue to free‑ride. This pattern suggests that they recognize the social optimum but prioritize maximizing own payoff over sustaining group efficiency.\n\nTheir behavior is not completely fixed: early on, they do contribute fully in a few instances, which looks like exploratory or conditional cooperation (testing how the group behaves and how profitable cooperation is) rather than a stable norm. Once it becomes clear that others frequently contribute and that reward is available, they still choose not to contribute in most rounds, indicating low internal commitment to fairness norms and a strong preference for self‑benefit whenever the structure allows it.\n\nRisk tolerance appears moderate: they are willing to cooperate a few times in an environment where many are saying they will contribute, but they retreat quickly to the low‑risk, high‑certainty option of defecting when they see that the game permits profitable free‑riding and that others will often continue to invest regardless. Overall, they act as a calculated payoff‑maximizer rather than as a reciprocity‑driven cooperator.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThey never speak in the chat. This silence persists despite active discussion about cooperation, “parasites,” and free‑riders.\n\nThis non‑engagement suggests:\n- They avoid social persuasion, either not needing to justify their behavior or preferring not to attract attention to their non‑cooperative choices.\n- They show no explicit attempts at coordination, reinforcement, or moral framing.\n- They appear insensitive (at least behaviorally) to social pressure expressed via chat, maintaining their strategy without verbal defense, apology, or argument.\n\nBecause there is no verbal content from them, any specific beliefs or emotions they might hold about others’ comments are unknown.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThey show no noticeable end‑game shift; their contribution behavior late in the game matches their mid‑game pattern of consistent free‑riding. They do not exhibit a “last‑round” cooperative gesture, nor do they ramp up exploitation at the very end—because they are already exploiting the public good for most of the game.\n\nThey appear aware of the horizon in the sense that they have no incentive to build or preserve a long‑term cooperative reputation; they do nothing that looks like future‑oriented reciprocity. Their strategy is effectively myopic but payoff‑rational within the one‑shot logic of each round.\n\nAny nuanced belief about how the approaching final round should affect others’ behavior is unknown; their own pattern simply continues unchanged into the end game.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey never spend any resources on reward. Yet they repeatedly receive reward from others, sometimes substantial amounts, even while not contributing.\n\nTheir refusal to reward has several implications:\n- They value their own payoff enough to avoid any costly prosocial action, even when reward is relatively efficient.\n- They do not use reward strategically to try to shape others’ future contributions, despite being in a group where many others do reward.\n- They show no “gratitude signaling” via reciprocal reward toward those who have rewarded them; any such reciprocity is absent.\n\nThis positions them as a pure beneficiary of others’ generosity, not as a participant in the reward norm. Whether they consciously exploit the fact that rewarders cannot be identified is unclear, but behaviorally they act as if anonymity removes any reputational pressure to reward in return.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey see others’ contributions, rewards, and payoffs, and they are repeatedly rewarded themselves despite low or zero contributions. Nevertheless, they do not change their own pattern in a prosocial direction. Instead, they continue to free‑ride and never reciprocate in the reward stage.\n\nThis indicates:\n- Little behavioral responsiveness to positive incentives from others (they do not “reward back” or start contributing because they were rewarded).\n- Tolerance for being labeled indirectly as a “parasite” or “greedy” in chat: they do not adjust to avoid moral blame, nor do they shift behavior when cooperative players express frustration and eventually give up.\n- A learning pattern focused on own payoff: seeing that others keep contributing and sometimes rewarding even when some defect, they settle into the role that yields them high returns at low cost.\n\nTheir internal feelings about being singled out in group discourse are unknown, but their persistent strategy suggests that social disapproval, when not backed by material punishment, has negligible influence on their decisions.", "umap_x": 0.5719451308250427, "umap_y": 0.8577556610107422, "cluster_id": 5, "cluster_size": 37, "cluster_title": "Reward / Cooperation / Contribution", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around reward, cooperation, contribution, free, contributions."}
{"experiment": "5qNajwPqTHZR4hzfB", "participant": "xTAnc8ze4xBm5a3kN", "game_finished": true, "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is primarily a high, principled contributor who initially treats full contribution as the obvious, “common sense” norm. They repeatedly invest their entire endowment when they believe others will also do so, and they actively promote this as the efficient, fair strategy. Their behavior shows conditionality: they are willing to maintain high contributions even when some free-riding is present, as long as a substantial cooperative core exists and there is still hope of shifting the group. However, they are not blindly altruistic. When persistent low contributors and erratic behavior (including apparent “bot-like” or unserious behavior) undermine the cooperative norm, they temporarily switch to free-riding themselves, explicitly framing it as a reluctant adaptation to others’ choices rather than their ideal. Later, when the group swings back toward near-universal contribution, they rejoin full cooperation. They value group efficiency and appear to understand the payoff structure (they repeatedly emphasize that everyone earns more if everyone contributes), and they interpret low contribution as short-sighted “greed” and a violation of a shared rational standard. Their risk tolerance is moderate: they continue to cooperate for several rounds in the face of free-riding, but once it appears that some players will persistently defect despite explanations, they become willing to defect too, then revert to cooperation when conditions improve. Overall, they resemble a “norm-enforcing conditional cooperator” with some threshold for abandoning cooperation when group norms fail.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThey use chat actively but sparingly, focusing on coordination and norm-setting rather than small talk. Their tone is earnest, mildly didactic, and occasionally judgmental. Early on, they immediately attempt to coordinate everyone on full contribution, presenting it as the rational, payoff-dominant strategy. Later, they comment on specific low-contribution players, speculating that some might be bots and criticizing them as not understanding that group contribution benefits everyone. They engage with ongoing discussion (referencing others’ remarks about bots/animals) and respond by clarifying which avatars they mean, showing they read the chat and integrate others’ comments. As cooperation breaks down, they express disappointment and a resigned shift in strategy (“if we can’t beat them, join them”), then later summarize the situation in moralized terms, attributing non-cooperation to “greed” and “lack of common sense.” They do not threaten, insult directly, or attempt to shame specific individuals by name beyond labeling them as greedy or unaware; the criticism is targeted at behavior and mentality rather than at any one person. They show some frustration but remain coherent and focused on efficiency and group outcomes. Overall their communication style is pro-social, coordination-oriented, and norm-laden, with a mix of rational argument and moral judgment.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThey display clear awareness of the finite horizon. They reference collective effort and its failure close to the end and maintain full contribution in the final round despite prior frustrations, signaling that they still want to uphold a cooperative norm or “go out” cooperating. There is no strong end-game defection spike from this player; instead, after a brief mid/late-game defection period, they return to full contribution even with only a small number of rounds left. This suggests that their motivation is not purely myopic payoff maximization per round; they continue to seek efficiency and norm consistency rather than exploiting the end-game strategically. Their commentary near the end shows retrospective evaluation of the whole game (“we tried our best”) and a stable belief that some others’ preferences (or greed) prevented the optimal cooperative outcome.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey never spend any coins on reward throughout the game, despite the mechanism being available and despite receiving rewards themselves at several points. This suggests a strong reluctance to incur personal cost for positive reciprocity or indirect enforcement through rewards. Their strategy appears to be purely contribution-based and communication-based rather than relying on the reward mechanism. The absence of reward use is consistent: they do not selectively reward high contributors, do not attempt to “buy” cooperation, and do not use rewards as thanks or as a signal. This could indicate that they (a) discount the effectiveness of rewards as a coordination tool, (b) strongly prefer to keep their payoff rather than pay for social incentives, or (c) perceive explanation and norm-talk as their primary enforcement instrument. Their refusal to reward persists even when others reward them, suggesting that responding in kind is not part of their strategy. They behave as a “non-rewarding cooperator”: willing to contribute heavily to the public good, but not willing to spend additional resources to differentially incentivize others.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey appear attentive to others’ contribution behavior and infer types from outcomes and patterns across rounds. They note which avatars repeatedly undercontribute and label them as not understanding the payoff logic, possibly bots, or overly cautious/greedy. They also make inferences about others’ motives and intelligence, distinguishing between those who “get it” (understand that everyone earns more if everyone contributes) and those whose “greed” or excessive caution undermines that logic. Their own contribution shifts track group outcomes: once they see that a subset of players consistently fails to cooperate, and that group payoffs drop, they interpret this as a structural defect problem and adapt by joining the defectors, albeit regretfully. They do not explicitly refer to observed rewards or who is rewarding whom, and they never comment on specific reward patterns or costs, suggesting that payoff and reward data are less salient to them than contribution choices and aggregate cooperation levels. Their emotional response to others’ outcomes is a mix of frustration, disappointment, and resigned adaptation; they do not gloat when free-riding nor express gratitude when rewarded. Instead, they maintain a narrative that cooperation is objectively better and that non-cooperators are making a collectively irrational choice, shaping their persona as a rational-normative cooperator who updates behavior based on group adherence to that norm rather than on interpersonal reciprocity signals.", "umap_x": 0.5036941766738892, "umap_y": 1.4958274364471436, "cluster_id": 5, "cluster_size": 37, "cluster_title": "Reward / Cooperation / Contribution", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around reward, cooperation, contribution, free, contributions."}

They quickly align with a group norm of full contribution and then adhere to it consistently, even when others free-ride and when peers explicitly raise the option of reducing contributions. Their initial behavior shows a brief tension between self-interest and group norms: they verbally endorse a full-contribution strategy but under-contribute relative to that stated standard, suggesting some early strategic hedging or experimentation. Once the cooperative norm feels established, they stop deviating and maintain the full-cooperation level without further visible recalibration.\n\nTheir contributions become highly stable over time, with no clear downward adjustment in response to persistent free-riding or to others’ expressed frustration. This indicates relatively low sensitivity to short-term payoff disparities and a willingness to accept being exploited to preserve a cooperative pattern. They appear to hold a fairness norm that “everyone should give the maximum,” and they track who is persistently below that norm, but they do not themselves retaliate by reducing contributions. Instead, they rely on social pressure and moral judgment rather than direct material response.\n\nRisk-wise, they tolerate the risk that others will not reciprocate. Even after clear evidence that some participants consistently free-ride or give very little, they continue to contribute fully. This implies either a principled or identity-based commitment to cooperating, or a belief that sustained cooperation is still the best available response even in a mixed group. Conditionality is present only weakly: they adjust their commentary based on others’ behavior, but not their own contribution levels after the early rounds. In summary, they are a “norm-committed cooperator”: they may momentarily hedge but ultimately choose and stick to a high-cooperation, high-trust strategy despite imperfect reciprocity.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nTheir tone is generally cooperative, group-oriented, and mildly judgmental toward defectors. They use chat to signal alignment with the cooperative strategy, to encourage others, and to call attention to those who fail to meet the agreed standard.

They frame their messages around “we” and “same ones” rather than around their own payoffs, suggesting a focus on group behavior and norms over personal outcomes.\n\nThey engage actively rather than avoiding conflict: they explicitly note which roles are contributing less and remark on patterns of low contribution. However, they stop short of direct personal attacks; compared to some others who use insults or harsh language, their criticism is milder and more observational. They appear comfortable participating in a norm-enforcement discourse but do so in a relatively restrained manner.\n\nTheir communication is responsive: they echo the group’s emerging consensus (e.g., endorsing a unified contribution level, acknowledging repeat low contributors, agreeing with speculation about non-participating players).

Even when others raise the possibility that contributing is no longer worthwhile or explicitly suggest ceasing contributions in later stages, this player continues to fully cooperate. Their pattern indicates awareness that the game has a finite horizon but no shift toward a last-round or late-round exploitation strategy. They neither reduce contributions nor suggest that others should “cash out” near the end.\n\nThis behavior is consistent with a time-stable cooperative identity: their strategy does not decay as the end approaches.

They clearly understand that universal high contribution is payoff‑maximizing and repeatedly act in line with that belief. They prioritize collective efficiency over individual short‑term gain, and they tolerate being exploited by free‑riders rather than lowering their own standard. There is no observable experimentation or strategic adjustment; their pattern is stable and principle‑driven, not adaptive in response to others’ behavior. Risk tolerance for being “the sucker” is high, presumably because they care about the possibility of group‑level gains and/or their own identity as a consistent cooperator more than about eliminating exploitation.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThe player is openly pro‑cooperation, analytic, and somewhat sharp‑tongued.

Their default is to contribute nothing, even when the group visibly coordinates around full contributions and repeatedly emphasizes that everyone gains more by doing so. They clearly understand the structure of the game: at multiple points they switch to high or full contributions when many others are already contributing heavily, indicating awareness that cooperative norms are established and that their own choice can be safely varied without collapsing the group’s behavior.\n\nTheir contribution pattern is volatile rather than stable. They oscillate between full defection (taking all for themselves) and substantial or full contributions, with occasional intermediate values. This variability does not track a simple “tit-for-tat” with the group average; they continue to free-ride when others are still strongly cooperative and sometimes increase contributions even when some are defecting. This suggests they are not driven by fairness or reciprocity, but by opportunism and experimentation with what they can “get away with” while maintaining group provision.\n\nThey do not appear committed to equality of payoffs. They often let others shoulder the cooperative burden and accept the resulting inequity in their favor. When they do contribute more, there is no visible pattern of “making up” for earlier exploitation. Their willingness to free-ride in the face of explicit moral and efficiency arguments against it points to low weight on distributive fairness and high weight on personal payoff.\n\nRisk tolerance appears moderate. They are willing to free-ride openly in a chat-visible environment where defectors are being criticized, suggesting tolerance for social disapproval and low fear of reputational damage in this context. At the same time, they sometimes contribute high amounts even when others suggest withdrawing contributions, which may reflect either mild concern about collapsing the public good or uncertainty about optimal play. Overall, they prioritize exploration and individual gain over strict payoff maximization derived from stable strategy, implying either limited attention or a preference for varying behavior.\n\nConditionality is weak and inconsistent. They do not systematically reward high group cooperation with higher contributions, nor do they systematically punish low cooperation by withdrawing. Instead, they intermittently cooperate and defect regardless of others’ appeals. The one comment they make is mildly teasing and references contribution levels, which shows they notice others’ behavior, but their own decisions do not align with a strong conditional cooperator pattern. They are best characterized as a strategic free-rider who occasionally sprinkles in cooperative moves, not a norm-follower or fairness-driven contributor.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThe player is almost completely silent throughout the interaction, speaking only once and then in a light, somewhat ironic tone referencing others’ contribution levels. This indicates low engagement with group deliberation and little interest in active coordination or persuasion. They do not attempt to justify their own behavior, defend themselves from implicit accusations, or influence group norms.\n\nTheir single message suggests awareness of the emergent social norm (“20 is the fair/cooperative choice”) and uses humor or mild mockery framed around that norm. This shows they track the discourse and understand what is expected, but choose not to align their behavior consistently with those expectations. The tone is non-confrontational and not overtly hostile; it leans more toward detached amusement than aggression or empathy.\n\nThey do not respond to being in the criticized subset of players; despite multiple others complaining about defectors, they never speak up to explain, apologize, or argue. This avoidance suggests either indifference to social judgment in this anonymous setting, a desire to stay under the radar, or a strategic choice to not reveal motives. They also do not attempt to form alliances or join the clearly cooperative in-group; they stay socially peripheral.\n\nOverall, their communication style is minimalist, observant, and disengaged. They monitor chat enough to make a context-aware joke near the end but decline to invest effort in negotiation, norm-building, or conflict. This fits a persona that prioritizes personal outcomes and experimentation over relationship-building or group identity in the game.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThe player shows clear awareness of the finite horizon: they know how many rounds remain and their behavior shifts as the end approaches, but not in a straightforward monotonic “end-game defection” manner. In the penultimate rounds, they continue to mix cooperation and defection rather than moving cleanly toward full free-riding. They contribute nothing in a very late round even while others explicitly reaffirm their intention to stay cooperative, then follow with a nonzero, moderate contribution in the final round despite the absence of future interaction.\n\nThis final-round behavior suggests that they are not a purely backward-inducting, payoff-maximizing defector. Instead, they maintain their earlier opportunistic variability all the way to the end. The last-round moderate contribution may reflect residual norm pressure, a desire not to be seen as maximally selfish at the close, or simple continuation of their exploratory pattern rather than strategic horizon-based adjustment. Their end-game chat line, coming just before the final round, playfully calls attention to contribution levels rather than advocating a clear shift in behavior, implying they treat the late game as a continuation of the same social dynamic rather than a separate strategic phase.\n\nIn sum, their end-game response preserves their core type: a mostly self-interested, low-communication player who is aware of norms and timing but does not clearly ramp up defection at the end, instead maintaining a mix of exploitation and partial cooperation without strong sensitivity to the approaching conclusion.", "umap_x": -0.5494602918624878, "umap_y": 1.1663899421691895, "cluster_id": 3, "cluster_size": 29, "cluster_title": "Group / Contribution / Cooperative", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around group, contribution, cooperative, cooperation, contributions."}

They explicitly commit in chat to always choosing the maximum contribution and, aside from a single mid-game deviation to a moderate contribution, they consistently follow through on this stated plan. Their behavior indicates a strong willingness to incur an individual cost to support group cooperation, even when many others free-ride and there is no punishment or reward mechanism available.\n\nThe brief deviation to a lower contribution occurs after they have already observed substantial free-riding from multiple others, suggesting some sensitivity to fairness and reciprocity: they are not mechanically unconditional; they test defection once when cooperation seems unstable. However, they immediately revert to maximal contributions thereafter and maintain this until the final round, indicating that their default preference is to cooperate fully, even in the face of persistent exploitation.\n\nThey appear to accept the structural risk that they will subsidize others; their sustained high contributions despite ongoing defections show relatively low risk aversion about being the “sucker.” They seem more motivated by maintaining a cooperative identity and supporting the cooperative subgroup than by optimizing narrow self-payoffs in response to others’ behavior.\n\nOverall, their contribution strategy can be characterized as “principled cooperator with a brief experiment in partial defection”: they prefer to contribute fully, test deviation once when norms are undermined, and then reaffirm high contributions for the remainder of the game.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThe player communicates briefly and in a straightforward, cooperative manner. Early in the game, once a norm of full contribution is proposed by others, they publicly align themselves with that norm and make a simple, clear commitment to maintain maximum contributions going forward. They do not elaborate, argue, or moralize; their tone is matter-of-fact and affiliative, signaling that they are part of the cooperative coalition.\n\nThey do not engage further in the developing conflict between high contributors and low contributors, even as other players become openly hostile or derisive toward free-riders. The absence of additional comments from this player suggests a low tendency to confront or shame others, and a preference for letting their actions (consistently high contributions) express their stance. They do not attempt to persuade defectors directly, nor do they participate in strategizing about tracking or punishing low contributors.\n\nTheir style is thus quiet, cooperative, and non-confrontational: they join the group norm when it is established, publicly signal commitment once, and then focus on their own behavior rather than on verbal pressure or social sanctions. Responsiveness to others’ chat beyond that one alignment statement is unknown or low-confidence, but there is no evidence of active back-and-forth debate, negotiation, or emotional escalation from them.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThe player continues to contribute the maximum amount through the late and final rounds, showing no visible end-game unraveling in their strategy. Even when others begin explicitly questioning whether to keep contributing and when ongoing free-riding is evident, they maintain full contributions rather than shifting to self-serving defection as the horizon approaches.\n\nThey show awareness of the repeated structure earlier (by committing to “from now on”), but there is no sign that they strategically taper cooperation near the end to capture short-term gains. Instead, their behavior is time-consistent: they act as a high contributor early, mid, and late in the game, including the final round. This pattern suggests that their cooperation is not contingent on future reciprocity or fear of retaliation, but rather on a stable preference or norm for contributing, even when the game is about to end and individual incentives to defect are strongest.\n\nIn summary, they exhibit no detectable end-game decay; they persist as a principled cooperator through the last round, treating the closing phase of the game similarly to earlier phases despite changing incentives.", "umap_x": -0.4402517080307007, "umap_y": 1.0531466007232666, "cluster_id": 3, "cluster_size": 29, "cluster_title": "Group / Contribution / Cooperative", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around group, contribution, cooperative, cooperation, contributions."}

Their behavior is mostly stable and high, not gradually decaying, which suggests they value consistency and collective welfare rather than short‑term individual gain. There is one clear instance of zero contribution while the rest of the group is still largely cooperative; this looks like deliberate free-riding to “test” or exploit the situation rather than a mistake. After that, they revert to full contributions and stick with them, even after others openly discuss lowering contributions in response to persistent defectors. This pattern suggests they understand the incentive structure and are capable of opportunistic defection but, in practice, choose to act as a high contributor. They explicitly care about earning money and mention personal financial need, but they still prioritize the cooperative strategy that maximizes group returns, implying they believe that, in expectation, high cooperation is the best way to get a good payoff. They tolerate the presence of free‑riders and do not personally retaliate by lowering their own contributions, indicating low willingness to punish via contribution cuts and a relatively high tolerance for inequality if the cooperative norm remains largely intact. Risk tolerance appears moderate: they are willing to keep contributing at a high level despite visible defectors and despite being aware of their own financial constraints, which implies a willingness to absorb the risk that others might exploit them in order to preserve the cooperative arrangement.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThe player communicates in a friendly, informal, and prosocial tone. Early on, they publicly endorse the full-contribution norm and present it as a shared “let’s do this” team decision, indicating an interest in coordination and mutual assurance. Later, they justify continued cooperation in terms of the benefit from a higher multiplier, showing that they think in terms of collective efficiency and are comfortable referencing the underlying mechanism. They also explicitly affirm ongoing full contributions even when others express doubts or propose reducing contributions, signaling a desire to stabilize the norm and reassure cooperative peers. Their humor and light sarcasm suggest they are socially engaged but not aggressive: they joke about “betrayal” and speculate about the experimental framing (e.g., mentioning possible AI players and the animal icons) in a way that distances them from the more hostile tone of some others. They do not attack low contributors and do not join in name‑calling, which points to low aggressiveness and a preference for maintaining a civil atmosphere. They answer direct questions or prompts (for example about money “pennies” and motives) with honest, self‑disclosing replies rather than deflection, which hints at openness and a willingness to share personal context. Overall, they use communication to reinforce cooperation, explore the nature of the game as a social experiment, and maintain rapport, not to pressure or shame specific individuals.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThe player shows horizon awareness in that they openly recognize the broader experimental context and speculate about design elements, but this does not translate into classic end‑game defection. As the game approaches its final rounds, and others explicitly question whether continued full contributions make sense, they reaffirm their intention to keep contributing fully rather than shifting to self‑maximizing extraction. Even in the last round, when there is no future interaction to sustain reciprocity, they maintain the cooperative choice. This indicates an absence of end‑game decay in their strategy and suggests that their cooperation is anchored in a relatively stable norm or principle rather than purely future-oriented strategic reasoning. They seem to treat the game as both an earnings opportunity and a social/ethical test of fairness, and they prefer to “stay the course” to the end.

They begin by fully endorsing and enacting the “everyone contributes the maximum” norm, and for the majority of the game they stick to max contributions even when others deviate. However, on several occasions they contribute nothing while others are still largely cooperative, capturing very high payoffs. These defections are not random: they occur after norms are established, when the group remains highly cooperative, and when the player sees little personal downside to exploiting that trust.\n\nTheir behavior indicates conditional cooperation mixed with self-interested opportunism. They appear to value fairness in principle but are willing to violate it when the personal gains are salient and social sanctions are weak (no punishment/reward tools, anonymous context, very small real-money stakes). They explicitly downplay the monetary importance of the game, yet still care enough about “not giving free money” to low contributors to contemplate strategies that avoid subsidizing them.\n\nContribution levels are not stable: they alternate between full cooperation and full defection, with no gradual tapering. This all-or-nothing switching suggests deliberate strategic experimentation or calculated exploitation rather than confusion. They are aware of group-level efficiency (they talk about maximizing collective payout and fairness) but will prioritize individual payoff when they believe the system allows costless free-riding, especially when they feel the “bad actors” are fixed and unavoidable.\n\nRisk tolerance appears moderate: they are willing to free-ride even while being publicly visible as a defector, suggesting low concern about social judgment in this anonymous lab setting. At the same time, they often revert to full contributions, which may reflect caution about possible future punishment mechanisms or norms turning against them. Overall, their type is “principled conditional cooperator with opportunistic cheating when enforcement is weak and stakes feel trivial.”\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThe player is verbally pro-cooperation, norm-focused, and somewhat pragmatic-cynical. Early on, they signal strong support for full cooperation and frame it in terms of maximizing collective payoff. They also invoke fairness later, emphasizing that mutual cooperation allows everyone to gain without exploiting each other. This shows they understand both efficiency and equity arguments and can articulate them to guide group behavior.\n\nThey actively engage in coordination: they endorse the 20-contribution convention, reaffirm their own purported intention to keep contributing, and encourage others to track non-cooperators. They float the idea of future punishment as a way to enforce norms, revealing a preference for some form of accountability and an eye for mechanisms that could stabilize cooperation. They are responsive to the evolving group narrative, chiming in when others discuss strategy, punishment, or the nature of the experiment.\n\nTheir tone is relatively calm, rational, and less emotionally charged than the more insult-driven players. They do not join in name-calling or direct attacks; instead, they make meta-level comments about fairness, stakes, and potential punishment. At one point they highlight how low the real monetary stakes are, which gives them psychological license to treat the game more as a social experiment and less as a high-stakes moral interaction.\n\nThey also demonstrate cognitive reframing: they initially argue for full cooperation, later publicly suggest that it might be best to stop contributing because defectors are being subsidized, yet still personally contribute. This inconsistency suggests they separate “talk” (normative guidance, venting about fairness) from “action” (mixed cooperation and exploitation), and may test others’ reactions through chat. Overall, communication is engaged, strategic, norm-invoking, and mildly cynical rather than hostile.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThe player shows awareness that the game might include later stages or additional mechanisms. Early on they explicitly reference the possibility of a future punishment phase as a reason to maintain cooperation, indicating forward-looking thinking and sensitivity to horizon effects and institutional changes. They also talk about “maybe we can punish later,” suggesting they mentally model the game as potentially having multi-part structure beyond the visible contribution rounds.\n\nRegarding end-of-game behavior within the observed horizon, they do not exhibit a classic sharp end-game collapse. After publicly suggesting that it may be best to stop contributing because low contributors are free-riding, they continue to contribute the maximum through the remaining rounds. This pattern—talk of defection but actual continued cooperation—suggests either internal conflict, signaling to others to reconsider their strategies, or simple experimental curiosity.\n\nTheir contribution pattern remains a mix of high contributions and occasional free-rides, but they end the game on fully cooperative moves, not on a “take everything” spree. This indicates that while they recognize the logic of end-game defection and even voice it, they do not fully implement a pure backward-induction strategy. Instead, they maintain a largely cooperative identity at the close, possibly because they still prioritize perceived fairness norms, have lingering uncertainty about post-game consequences, or simply treat the end as low-stakes and not worth additional strategic maneuvering.

They continue to cooperate even when influential group members openly question whether continued cooperation is wise, and even when exploitation by low contributors is explicitly recognized. This suggests they either do not conditionalize their cooperation on others’ behavior or they assign very high intrinsic value to maintaining the cooperative rule once it is established.\n\nThey appear comfortable accepting lower personal returns to sustain a norm they see as “right,” implying a fairness or principle-based motivation rather than a purely outcome-based or risk-averse strategy.

Once they recommit to full contributions, their pattern is stable and not volatile: they do not escalate defection in response to others’ selfishness, nor do they “punish” defectors by withholding their own contributions later.\n\nThey appear to tolerate the risk of being exploited by a minority of low contributors in order to sustain cooperation with the majority. They accept that some players will not follow the cooperative agreement but still choose to contribute fully, indicating relatively high risk tolerance for being taken advantage of, combined with a preference for moral or consistency-based payoffs over narrow monetary gain. Their strategy is “cooperate almost unconditionally, with minimal experimentation,” rather than “strictly reciprocate others’ average behavior.”\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nTheir communication style is sparse, cooperative, and socially attuned but not confrontational. They participate in the early group norm-setting by openly declaring their cooperative choice, aligning themselves with full contributors and reinforcing the emerging social standard. When the group later vents frustration at defectors, they do not attack or insult others; instead, they simply reaffirm their own decision to keep fully contributing, signaling commitment rather than aggression.\n\nThey show light, affiliative engagement with group banter, responding briefly and with humor, which suggests a desire to maintain a positive group atmosphere rather than to dominate the discussion.

The only clear deviation is one early low contribution that conflicts with their simultaneous verbal statement of intending to keep contributing fully. After that, they revert immediately to full contributions and remain there. Because this low contribution is isolated and not repeated despite clear opportunities to exploit others later, it looks less like a strategic pivot and more like either experimentation, a one‑off opportunistic slip, or an input error. Motivation for that anomaly is unknown.\n\nThey demonstrate strong adherence to an equal‑contribution fairness norm. They align themselves with the group that wants everyone to put in the maximum, and they continue contributing fully even when it is financially disadvantageous relative to free‑riding. This suggests they are willing to trade off some personal payoff to sustain a cooperative norm or to remain consistent with their stated intentions.\n\nTheir conditionality is limited: they do see that some players are not cooperating, but they do not respond by lowering their own contributions in a systematic tit‑for‑tat way. They are not strongly risk‑averse about being exploited; instead, they act as a “cooperative anchor,” holding to high contributions despite exploitation risk and actual exploitation. They may be motivated by a mix of norm compliance, preference for group efficiency, and a desire to maintain a pro‑social self‑image, but exact internal motives are unknown.\n\nOverall, their strategy is simple and robust: contribute fully, signal willingness to do so, and persist with that plan even under moderate social and material pressure to defect. They do not appear to actively hedge against others’ selfishness or to fine‑tune contributions based on round‑to‑round behavior by others.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThe player’s communication is sparse but affiliative and norm‑reinforcing.

They display low deference to group norms and seem to enjoy or at least accept being framed as a “villain” or least valuable contributor. When others insult their behavior, they respond with irony rather than apology or justification, and they offer no cooperative promises.\n\nThey show awareness of the social experiment aspect but use it to rationalize or distance themselves from the moral content of their choices, not to move toward cooperation. Overall, they engage selectively and provocatively: they respond when targeted, with humor that minimizes others’ moral critiques, and they do not show interest in constructive dialogue or reputation repair.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nAwareness of the finite horizon is clear from the game setup, but there is no evidence of an end-game shift toward greater cooperation. The player does not engage in a late effort to appear fair or reciprocate others’ sustained high contributions. Instead, low contributions persist into the final rounds, including the very last decision, where they continue to free ride despite high group contributions.\n\nThere is no visible cooperation decay in the sense of starting cooperative then dropping; rather, their strategy is already non-cooperative and remains so. Any minor increases earlier do not crescendo into an end-game cooperation burst. Their approach to the horizon appears consistent with a short-term, payoff-focused mindset: once they see that others will continue to contribute despite their behavior, they maintain exploitation through the end rather than moderating for reputational or moral reasons.", "umap_x": -0.6577668786048889, "umap_y": 1.0197863578796387, "cluster_id": 1, "cluster_size": 27, "cluster_title": "Contributions / Contribution / Cooperation", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around contributions, contribution, cooperation, group, high."}
{"experiment": "5srShkDRaeNasJntF", "participant": "nrDzxRcyzLMQjmgfv", "game_finished": true, "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a calculated, opportunistic free‑rider with intermittent, low-cost cooperation. Their default is to take the full private endowment and contribute nothing, especially when others are contributing high amounts. They occasionally contribute fully or partially, but these cooperative moves are unstable and appear driven by short-term social or emotional dynamics rather than a stable fairness norm.\n\nThey clearly understand the incentive structure: they explicitly frame noncontributors as “selfish” while themselves frequently free‑riding, indicating awareness that taking while others give is norm‑violating yet privately profitable. Their contribution pattern is highly volatile, oscillating between full defection and full cooperation, with a few intermediate contributions. There is no consistent upward or downward trend; instead, they switch modes in response to social pressure, being called out, or their own desire to provoke.\n\nThey do not appear motivated by collective efficiency; when the group is close to full cooperation, they often revert to zero, exploiting others’ contributions. At times, they sarcastically question whether others “need the extra penny,” which signals that they understand payoffs are small in absolute terms and treat the game partly as a low-stakes environment for experimentation or provocation.\n\nConditionality is present but asymmetric: they expect others to cooperate and feel entitled to criticize noncooperators, yet they do not reliably match the group’s cooperative norm. When directly socially targeted (e.g., being called out for not contributing), they temporarily conform by contributing fully, then explicitly state an intention to revert to zero, and later do revert. This indicates they adjust behavior to manage reputation in the short run but ultimately prioritize personal gain and autonomy over sustained norm compliance.\n\nRisk tolerance appears moderate: they are willing to risk social disapproval and reputational damage for extra personal earnings and for the satisfaction of needling the group. They do not show concern about being punished in this specific game, and even when others mention potential punishment phases, this does not anchor them into long-term cooperation.\n\nOverall, their contribution behavior fits a “cynical, self-aware free‑rider” type: they know what full cooperation would yield, occasionally participate, but mainly exploit cooperative others while using sarcasm and deflection to manage the social cost.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nTheir tone is sharp, sarcastic, and sometimes openly insulting. Early on, they label low contributors as selfish in crude terms, positioning themselves as morally outraged despite their own noncooperative choices. This reveals a readiness to moralize and blame, but in a way that is inconsistent with their actual behavior.\n\nThey engage actively in chat rather than staying silent, showing a preference for social engagement over withdrawal. However, their contributions are not focused on constructive coordination; they do not help establish or sustain a clear contribution rule beyond a brief statement aligning with the group norm, which they do not adhere to consistently. Their “agreement” to cooperate looks more like a performative move than a binding commitment.\n\nThey respond to being socially called out with defiance rather than remorse. When someone attributes their sudden cooperation to social pressure, they openly state that they will revert to defecting, signaling both awareness and indifference to others’ evaluations. This suggests a contrarian streak and a willingness to push back against group expectations, possibly deriving enjoyment from baiting others.\n\nThey engage in light teasing and provocation about the small stakes (e.g., questioning whether others “need the extra penny”), which serves both to minimize the seriousness of their norm violations and to frame the whole situation as somewhat trivial. This lets them downplay responsibility while still reaping benefits.\n\nThey do not attempt systematic persuasion or leadership. They neither present payoff calculations nor try to build long-term trust. Instead, their communicative style is reactive: they comment on others’ behavior, mock, or respond to social signals, but do not provide a coherent cooperative narrative. Their communication pattern suggests a socially aware, somewhat antagonistic participant who values irony and autonomy over harmony or collective optimization.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nAwareness of the finite horizon is structurally present in the game, but this player’s end-game behavior does not show a straightforward “end-game defection ramp.” Instead, they continue their oscillating pattern: sometimes fully contributing even very late, sometimes defecting shortly before the final round.\n\nNear the end, when others explicitly reassess whether to keep contributing or stop feeding free‑riders, this player does not clearly align with either camp. They continue to mix cooperation and defection, suggesting that their strategy is not an explicit backward-induction equilibrium play but rather opportunistic and mood/socially driven. There is no clear evidence that they increase defection solely because the game is about to end; instead, they display the same inconsistency as earlier: free‑ride in one late round, fully cooperate in the final round.\n\nTheir final-round full contribution indicates at least one of the following, with low confidence on which: (a) some remaining desire to appear cooperative at the last visible moment; (b) a small “last-round generosity” impulse once there is no future to exploit; or (c) simple continuation of a high–low switching pattern without deep horizon reasoning. Because they earlier express indifference to small payoffs and embrace a provocative persona, it is unclear whether this final cooperation reflects genuine pro-social preference or just a capricious choice.\n\nIn sum, their response to the end game is not a clean decay or escalation pattern but a continuation of volatile, partly contrarian behavior. They do not reliably exploit the final rounds more than earlier ones; instead, they remain a self-aware, inconsistent cooperator who occasionally invests even at the very end, with strategic horizon awareness largely unknown or at least not transparently expressed in their choices.", "umap_x": -0.9459990859031677, "umap_y": 1.2151731252670288, "cluster_id": 3, "cluster_size": 29, "cluster_title": "Group / Contribution / Cooperative", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around group, contribution, cooperative, cooperation, contributions."}
{"experiment": "5srShkDRaeNasJntF", "participant": "qM3YWhTFXGkrzcbXY", "game_finished": true, "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThe player is best described as an “ideological high contributor with one early defection.” Their default is to contribute the maximum possible amount and to stick with that almost unwaveringly. Across the game they consistently choose the cooperative, high-contribution option even when others free-ride and even when peers explicitly discuss defecting in response to low contributors.\n\nThey show one early deviation from their stated intention: after publicly committing to keep contributing the maximum, they briefly contribute less than that. This suggests some willingness to experiment with self-serving behavior or to test whether others notice, but they quickly revert to full cooperation and then maintain it. After that, their behavior is stable and not volatile.\n\nTheir contribution rule appears primarily norm- and efficiency-based rather than purely payoff-maximizing in the narrow sense. They repeatedly insist that contributing the maximum “makes more” for everyone, indicating they understand and care about joint surplus. At the same time, they show frustration with free-riders and briefly question what the group should do, but they do not follow through on retaliatory under-contribution. This suggests a conditional-cooperator mindset in rhetoric, but a near unconditional-cooperator pattern in action.\n\nThey display strong fairness norms: they condemn low contributors and describe them in negative moral or intellectual terms, framing low contribution as both unfair and irrational. They seem risk-tolerant with respect to exploitation: they keep sending high contributions despite clear evidence that some players are persistently free-riding and despite discussion that some might never change. They appear more motivated by upholding a principled cooperative stance and maximizing possible earnings than by protecting themselves against being taken advantage of.\n\nOverall, the player’s strategy in contribution choices is: aim for full cooperation, push for a group norm of maximal contributions, and personally uphold that norm even when others defect. Punishment or reward mechanisms are not used in this game, but from their rhetoric, they likely support sanctioning low contributors if it were available.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThe player’s tone is direct, sometimes blunt, and occasionally abrasive. They readily criticize low contributors, using morally and intellectually charged language. When someone who previously contributed little increases to the maximum, they publicly attribute that change to social pressure and mock the idea that the change is sincere. They also express a willingness to continue criticizing low contributors, showing low tolerance for free-riding.\n\nThey actively engage in coordination and persuasion. Early on, they endorse the emerging group plan of maximal contributions and clearly align themselves with that coalition. They repeatedly emphasize that fully contributing is the most profitable and rational strategy, appealing to both fairness and self-interest. When contributions dip, they confront the discrepancy between what others said they would do and what they actually do, highlighting hypocrisy.\n\nThey participate in group discussions beyond pure strategy, commenting on motives (e.g., money being important, wanting the most possible) and supporting others who are concerned about earnings. They explicitly frame the game as about “money is money” and argue against dismissing small earnings. This indicates they care about the material stakes and want others to treat the decision-making seriously.\n\nTheir engagement style is proactive and responsive rather than avoidant. They initiate comments (e.g., asking what the group is doing when strategy is uncertain) and respond to others’ remarks, aligning with cooperators and opposing free-riders. They show some flexibility in tone: while often harsh toward defectors, they can also agree or affirm others’ more neutral hypotheses (for example, speculating that non-contributing players might be bots or not paying attention).\n\nThey are socially coalition-oriented: they identify with the cooperative majority, join in labeling low contributors as outsiders, and reinforce in-group norms of full contribution. They do not attempt to appease free-riders or understand them; instead, they morally distance from them and frame them as foolish or selfish. Overall, their communication attempts to bolster a high-contribution norm, shame defectors, and keep the cooperative group cohesive.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThe player demonstrates clear awareness of the finite horizon; they explicitly reference the group’s strategy when the game is nearing its conclusion, seeking clarification on whether the group plans to maintain or change its approach. This shows they recognize that end-game incentives may shift and that coordination may need to be revisited.\n\nDespite this awareness, their actual behavior does not exhibit classic end-game decay. Even when others suggest that it might be best to stop contributing, or that contributing is just benefiting free-riders, the player stays with maximal contributions through the closing rounds. Their brief inquiry about “what are we doing” near the end leads to confirmation that some others will keep fully contributing, after which they promptly reaffirm this cooperative path in their own choices.\n\nThus, their end-game response is to remain cooperative and norm-consistent rather than to exploit the final rounds. They do not switch to self-interested defection, nor do they escalate contributions (as they are already at the maximum). Instead, they maintain a stable cooperative strategy, guided more by their fairness and efficiency-based norm than by backward induction. Their late-game play is best characterized as “principled maximal cooperator with horizon awareness but no cooperation decay.”", "umap_x": -0.7225109338760376, "umap_y": 1.3888014554977417, "cluster_id": 3, "cluster_size": 29, "cluster_title": "Group / Contribution / Cooperative", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around group, contribution, cooperative, cooperation, contributions."}

Their default pattern is to give the full endowment and maintain that even when others free-ride. They do not react strongly to small changes in others’ behavior and continue to contribute fully in many later rounds despite persistent low contributors. However, they occasionally choose a lower amount, clearly increasing their own payoff while the majority is still contributing high; these deviations are rare but deliberate. This suggests a primarily cooperative type who nonetheless opportunistically free-rides at times when it is salient or tempting.\n\nTheir contributions are fairly stable rather than highly volatile: the modal behavior is full contribution, with just a couple of mid-level contributions interspersed. They show some awareness that “it’s just a game” and do not appear strongly motivated by fairness enforcement; their own contributions do not systematically punish defectors. They seem comfortable accepting less-than-maximal earnings for the sake of maintaining a cooperative pattern most of the time, indicating moderate risk tolerance and some intrinsic or norm-based preference for cooperation, but not a strict commitment to always maximizing group welfare.\n\nConditioning on others’ behavior is weak: the player continues to give high even after clear evidence of freeriding, and their few lower contributions do not closely track specific others’ defections. They appear to treat cooperation as a decent default but not an inviolable rule.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThe player’s tone is generally brief, dry, and somewhat detached. Early on they explicitly signal that they are contributing fully, aligning with the cooperative group. They rarely initiate coordination but do acknowledge and affirm others’ comments. They respond to logistical concerns (such as idleness warnings) with pragmatic, minimal remarks, showing situational awareness but not strong emotional investment.\n\nWhen another participant labels them negatively, the player becomes more pointed: they push back with curt, mildly confrontational replies and explicitly state they do not care about the other’s feelings. They frame the situation as “just a game,” downplaying the emotional or moral weight that some others attach to contributions. This indicates a low sensitivity to social shaming and a tendency to de-escalate moral seriousness by reframing the interaction as inconsequential.\n\nThey do not try to persuade others on contribution levels and do not engage in moralizing about fairness or selfishness; instead, they keep communication sparse and reactive. Their engagement style is selective: they respond when directly implicated or when a practical issue is raised, but otherwise they stay relatively quiet. Overall they present as a pragmatic, somewhat thick-skinned participant who cooperates more than they preach, and who resists being socially pressured or insulted.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThere is no pronounced end-game collapse in their cooperation. Near the horizon, after other players openly question whether to keep contributing, this player still makes at least one opportunistic low contribution but then returns to full contributions and ends the game cooperating at a high level. They do not exploit the final round with a last-minute defection, and they explicitly echo the “it’s just a game” framing rather than shifting to a purely payoff-maximizing stance as the end approaches.\n\nThey appear aware of the finite horizon (the remaining rounds are visible), yet their pattern suggests only weak horizon-based strategic adjustment. Their end-game strategy continues to blend mostly high contributions with occasional self-interested choices, without a clear systematic decline.

They always give the maximum possible amount and never deviate, regardless of others’ behavior, free-riding, or group conflict. Their strategy is stable and non‑reactive: repeated evidence that some group members contribute little or nothing does not change their own contributions. They explicitly commit to continuing maximal contributions even after it becomes clear that some others are exploiting the group. Their cooperative norm appears principled rather than purely payoff‑maximizing: they state that everyone could earn more by contributing fully, but they keep cooperating even when that condition is not met. They show strong fairness concerns at the group level (wanting everyone to contribute equally) and accept personal earnings losses relative to defectors. Risk tolerance is high: they repeatedly expose themselves to exploitation by low contributors and never hedge. There is no sign of conditional cooperation; their pattern fits a “stubborn altruist / normative cooperator” type, with low sensitivity to short‑term incentives and high attachment to a fairness/efficiency rule of “everyone should give all.”\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThe player is socially engaged, cooperative, and mildly humorous, with a generally warm and relaxed tone. They support the full‑contribution norm, verbally endorse matching the cooperative group, and use light joking and casual language rather than anger or insults. They clearly recognize that some participants are lying or free‑riding but respond with acceptance or gentle commentary rather than hostility. They align themselves with the cooperative majority, reiterating the norm, but avoid direct personal attacks on low contributors and even offer mildly reassuring or nonjudgmental comments toward them. They are responsive to the ongoing discussion, referencing what others say (e.g., about punishment, about money needs, about the study being a social experiment) and expanding on it. Their persuasion style is soft and normative: they emphasize that everyone could make more money by contributing fully and frame participation as a shared situation where “we all need money,” but they do not threaten, shame, or try to organize retaliation. They appear comfortable with the experimental context, explicitly labeling it as a social experiment and treating the stakes as small “pennies,” which contributes to their relaxed, prosocial stance.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThe player shows no end‑game defection or decay in cooperation. They keep contributing the maximum amount through the final rounds, even after others openly discuss withdrawing cooperation and even after it is clear that some group members are strategically or spitefully under‑contributing. Their horizon awareness is present (they acknowledge the experimental nature and low stakes), but it does not alter their behavior; they stay consistent with their cooperative norm until the end. In the very last phase, they verbally downplay the monetary importance of their own payoff and signal willingness to let others benefit from their contributions if needed, which reinforces that their cooperation is value‑driven rather than strategically adjusted to the short remaining time.

Their default choice is to contribute nothing, even when others contribute high amounts and even when this clearly increases group payoffs. They sometimes contribute moderately or fully, but these instances do not lead to a stable cooperative pattern; instead, they quickly revert to zero contributions after being targeted with punishment. Their behavior suggests that personal payoff maximization dominates any fairness or reciprocity considerations: when not punished, they prefer taking the entire endowment and benefiting from others’ contributions. They do not condition their contributions positively on others’ cooperation; even sustained and substantial contributions from others fail to elicit consistent co-contribution. When they do contribute a lot, they accept that others are contributing less and do not appear to require equal matching, showing little concern for outcome equality. They show no sign of “strategic cooperation” to build a reputation, despite identifiable punishment and reward, indicating low concern for being perceived as fair or pro-social. Overall, they behave as a payoff-seeking, low-conditional cooperator who only sporadically deviates from pure free-riding and does not systematically learn from social sanctions.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThe player never punishes anyone, even when faced with repeated and severe punishment from a specific co-player. This suggests a very strong reluctance to spend resources on norm enforcement or retaliation. They do not punish low contributors, do not retaliate against those who punish them, and do not use punishment to shape others’ behavior. Given that punishment is relatively efficient in this environment, their consistent refusal to use it indicates either (a) an aversion to “wasting” coins on others regardless of potential impact, (b) very low taste for retribution, or (c) indifference or resignation toward others’ strategic choices. There is no evidence they selectively withhold punishment for cooperative partners versus defectors; they simply never engage in it at all. This passivity points to a type that prefers to absorb externalities—positive or negative—rather than invest in modifying others’ behavior.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nWhen punished—often harshly and repeatedly by one identifiable partner—the player does not respond with compliance (i.e., sustained higher contributions) and does not retaliate through punishment. At most, there are isolated instances where they temporarily increase contributions after being targeted, but these changes are inconsistent and never evolve into a stable cooperative response. Over time, they continue to expose themselves to further sanctions, including extremely costly ones, without altering their strategy to avoid them. This pattern suggests either that they undervalue or ignore the future deterrent role of punishment, or that they view the game myopically, focusing on immediate choices rather than dynamic adjustment. Their lack of counter-punishment, even against a clearly aggressive punisher, indicates either a forgiving, non-confrontational stance or a strategic decision that retaliation is not worth the cost. However, because their contributions do not move toward the punisher’s apparent norm, they are not “compliant” in the normative-enforcement sense; they are better characterized as stoic or indifferent under sanctions rather than responsive.\n\n<REWARD>\nThe player never rewards anyone, despite many opportunities and despite facing others who contribute consistently and sometimes reward or punish in ways that could be interpreted as attempts at coordination. They do not use rewards to encourage high contributors or to reciprocate when they themselves are rewarded. This suggests that they treat the reward mechanism as strictly dominated from their perspective: they are unwilling to sacrifice even small amounts of payoff to positively reinforce others. There is no evidence of selective rewarding (e.g., supporting cooperators while withholding from defectors); instead, there is complete abstention. This supports an interpretation of the player as highly self-regarding and uninterested in building cooperative “alliances” via positive incentives, even though rewarders are identifiable and could, in principle, become useful partners.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThe player occasionally receives rewards from others, but never reciprocates with either higher contributions directed toward those partners or with rewards of their own. Being rewarded does not reliably change their contribution pattern: they continue to free-ride in most subsequent decisions, including against those who had previously rewarded them. They also do not use the reward mechanism to “thank” or signal alliance with their benefactors. This indicates low sensitivity to positive reinforcement and little interest in relational reciprocity. In psychological terms, they appear to treat rewards as windfall income rather than as social signals that call for a response. There is no sign of gratitude-based behavior, nor of strategic thinking along the lines of “if I reward the rewarder, we can sustain a mutually beneficial high-contribution regime.” Instead, rewards are simply absorbed without altering strategy.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThe player consistently observes detailed information about others’ contributions, payoffs, and their spending on punishment and reward, yet does not adapt in ways that align with either typical fairness norms or best responses to observed enforcement. They see others repeatedly making costly sacrifices—some burning large amounts of their own payoff to punish or reward—while they themselves remain passive and self-focused. The heavy, sustained punishment from one co-player, often targeted at them, does not provoke retaliation or lasting compliance and does not cause them to exit the free-riding pattern overall. High contributions and high payoffs by others also fail to induce them to shift toward cooperative behavior. Their occasional high-contribution choices appear weakly related to the unfolding pattern of others’ outcomes and are not followed by consistent strategic adjustments. Overall, they notice but effectively disregard others’ payoff sacrifices and enforcement efforts, continuing to prioritize their own immediate earnings and tolerating significant payoff volatility caused by others’ punishment. This suggests a type who is observationally informed but strategically stubborn: they see what others do, understand that others are willing to incur large costs for norms or retaliation, yet largely maintain their own narrow, self-regarding course.", "umap_x": 0.6859347820281982, "umap_y": -1.0999304056167603, "cluster_id": 6, "cluster_size": 31, "cluster_title": "Punishment / Reward / Contribution", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around punishment, reward, contribution, contributions, low."}
{"experiment": "5t4Ap8vtxqkcQ9zKZ", "participant": "dzMx39Ek9LRKkgeLf", "game_finished": true, "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a highly volatile, conditionally cooperative contributor who oscillates between very high and zero contributions. They are clearly willing to contribute well above the group average when they perceive others as at least moderately cooperative, and they also sometimes contribute nothing even when others are contributing strongly. Their behavior does not follow a simple matching rule (e.g., always matching others’ average); rather, they seem to test different contribution levels and then react strongly through punishment/reward rather than through smooth contribution adjustment.\n\nThey do not appear to anchor on a stable fairness norm like “everyone should contribute half” or “everyone should contribute all.” Instead, they tolerate substantial inequality in contributions at some points without changing their own contribution immediately, and at other points they sharply drop to zero despite high contributions from others. This suggests that contribution decisions are not their primary enforcement tool; they rely more on punishment and reward to express norms.\n\nRisk tolerance appears high: they frequently choose contribution levels that leave them exposed to low personal payoffs, or even negative payoffs once sanction decisions are included. This indicates that maximizing own payoff is not their core motive; they are willing to sacrifice payoff for other goals (norm enforcement, expression of approval/disapproval, or emotional satisfaction).\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThis player is an extremely heavy and emotionally driven punisher, willing to incur very large personal costs to impose large deductions on others. They use punishment both selectively (targeting single individuals) and collectively (hitting all others at once), and their punishment is not consistently aligned with a clear, stable social-efficiency norm.\n\nThey punish both low contributors and high contributors at different times, so their trigger is not simply “you contributed too little” or “you free-rode on me.” In some instances they heavily punish someone who contributes a moderate or high amount, suggesting that retaliation or frustration plays a role. They also occasionally punish all peers simultaneously regardless of their relative contributions, which looks more like a generalized expression of anger or dominance than measured deterrence.\n\nThe intensity of punishment is often far beyond what is needed to alter immediate material incentives; they spend enough to drive targets’ round payoffs close to or below zero, and they absorb large self-costs to do so. This pattern is consistent with strong negative reciprocity or spite: they appear willing to “burn money” just to hurt others. There is no clear evidence that they calibrate punishment to marginal changes in others’ contributions; rather, punishment tends to come in large, discrete bursts.\n\nThey do not appear to adjust punishment downwards in response to others’ subsequent cooperative behavior in any consistent way. After someone they previously punished later contributes highly, they sometimes still punish them again, and in another case massively sanctions a very high contributor. Thus, deterrence or forward-looking incentive design seems secondary at best; expressive or retaliatory motives dominate.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nThis player is repeatedly punished by others, sometimes substantially. Their response is not compliant or conciliatory; they do not reliably increase contribution or reduce sanctioning after being punished. Instead, they continue to mix high and low contributions and periodically escalate their own punishment of others. There is no observable pattern of “learning” from punishment—for example, they do not settle into a stable, cooperative contribution level in response to being sanctioned.\n\nThey also do not show clear targeted retaliation against specific punishers. When they are punished, multiple others are often involved in punishing them, and in subsequent rounds the focal player’s sanctions are allocated in ways that do not map cleanly onto “who punished me before.” Sometimes they attack players who had not recently punished them, and sometimes they leave recent punishers alone. This suggests that while they may feel generally antagonistic when punished, their response is diffuse rather than precise revenge.\n\nForgiveness is limited or unstable: they do not systematically ease up on those who previously punished them even when those players later contribute cooperatively. Instead, their stance toward others seems to reset each round based on the current configuration of contributions and perhaps accumulated grievances, rather than a clear tit-for-tat memory structure.\n\n<REWARD>\nThis player shows that they can be extremely generous with rewards, but this generosity is sporadic and short-lived. When they choose to reward, they are willing to spend very large amounts to transfer substantial payoffs to others, even at great personal cost, including driving their own round payoff negative. At least once, they reward multiple peers simultaneously and at high intensity, indicating a willingness to create large positive differentials in others’ favor.\n\nTheir reward behavior early on is fairly aligned with peer contributions: they reward others who contribute non-zero amounts, including those who are contributing more than them and those who are around or above the group average. This looks like an attempt to reinforce cooperation and signal approval for contributing. However, the reward technology is symmetric (1:1), so these choices are not payoff-maximizing and serve more as social signaling than incentive-efficient behavior.\n\nOver the game, reward usage fades almost entirely. After some early episodes of intense rewarding, they largely stop rewarding despite many opportunities where others contribute cooperatively. This suggests either learning (deciding that rewards are not effective or satisfying) or a shift in affect (moving from hopeful encouragement to frustration and punitive focus). They do not systematically use rewards to build alliances or to maintain mutual support once initial attempts are made.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nWhen they are rewarded, they continue to interact with those rewarders in ways that do not clearly reflect stable gratitude or reciprocity. They occasionally receive positive transfers from others yet do not consistently reward those same individuals later, nor do they reliably protect them from punishment. Sometimes they even punish players who have previously rewarded them, and at other times they simply ignore them.\n\nThere is no clear pattern of forming a “coalition of cooperators” based on mutual rewarding. Being rewarded does not anchor their contribution level upward in any stable way, and does not prevent them from subsequently dropping contributions or imposing severe sanctions. This suggests that while they may appreciate being rewarded in the moment (unobservable), their behavior does not embody strategic reciprocity toward rewarders.\n\nOverall, their response to being rewarded is inconsistent and short-term; they do not seem to use it as a basis for long-lived alliances or for stable norms of mutual support.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThis player appears highly attentive to others’ payoffs and sanction activities, and they frequently react strongly to what they see. They are willing to massively reduce others’ payoffs when they perceive some form of dissatisfaction—whether due to contribution patterns, prior sanctioning, or overall outcome distributions. Sometimes they heavily punish a player who is currently earning high payoffs, which could reflect envy, resentment of perceived advantage, or a desire to “cut down” high earners regardless of their contribution level.\n\nThey also occasionally respond to cooperative environments with extreme generosity, boosting others’ payoffs far beyond their own. This indicates that they are sensitive not only to negative but also to positive configurations: when they feel others are behaving well, they may try to magnify that through reward, even at a loss.\n\nBecause they often accept very low or negative own payoffs to alter others’ outcomes, their utility seems to put substantial weight on relative payoffs and the emotional satisfaction of sanctioning (positive or negative), rather than solely on their own earnings. They do not systematically track others’ cumulative histories in a way that produces consistent patterns; instead, their behavior suggests episodic, affect-driven reactions to the most recent round’s contributions and sanctions.\n\nIn strategic terms, this type can be described as a high-intensity, affect-driven enforcer: willing to cooperate, to lavishly reward, and to severely punish, but without a stable, transparent rule that others can easily predict or exploit. Their presence in a group tends to increase volatility in both contributions and payoffs, as others face uncertain but potentially extreme reactions to their behavior.", "umap_x": -0.8401052355766296, "umap_y": -1.3382375240325928, "cluster_id": 2, "cluster_size": 40, "cluster_title": "Punishment / Group / Contribution", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around punishment, group, contribution, reward, contributions."}
{"experiment": "5t4Ap8vtxqkcQ9zKZ", "participant": "hwGAH4iDvuZSvMxNo", "game_finished": true, "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a moderately cooperative, highly responsive conditional contributor with substantial volatility. They frequently choose mid-range contributions rather than extremes, but sometimes jump to full free-riding or full contribution. Their behavior tracks perceived norms and recent interaction patterns: when others appear to be contributing reasonably or improving, they tend to contribute at a medium-to-high level; when they see strong free-riding or chaotic punishment, they sharply lower their own contributions. They are not focused on strict payoff-maximization: they sometimes contribute generously even when others contribute little, and sometimes under-contribute relative to others despite the high multiplier. They seem to care about “deservingness” and reciprocity more than about stable efficiency. They also tolerate personal payoff losses in order to express social approval or disapproval via punishment and reward, implying relatively high social-risk tolerance and low purely monetary risk aversion. Their notion of fairness is asymmetric: they appear more sensitive to under-contribution from particular players they already view negatively than to under-contribution in general, and they do not aim for consistent equalization of everyone’s contributions.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThis player is a selective but emotionally responsive punisher who uses punishment both normatively and personally. They do not punish every low contributor, nor do they consistently punish free riders; instead, they target specific players in specific relational contexts. Once a player is perceived as problematic (e.g., through heavy or erratic punishment of others, or repeated norm violations), this player is willing to punish them even when that target is actually contributing relatively well. This pattern suggests that motives are a mix of norm enforcement and retaliation/character judgment rather than pure contribution-based deterrence. They are willing to pay substantial personal costs to impose punishment when they feel standards have been violated, indicating a strong expressive component. At the same time, they sometimes refrain from punishing in environments where punishment is already very intense or chaotic, suggesting some awareness that additional punishment can be counterproductive. Overall, they use punishment more as a relational signal (“you are in the wrong”) than as a finely calibrated tool to marginally increase future cooperation.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nWhen punished, this player does not reliably respond with either systematic retaliation or clear compliance. In some instances, being punished coincides with them reducing contributions or shifting target choices in punishment, but the direction of causality is ambiguous: they may already be in a conflictual environment with multiple punishers. They do not launch automatic counter-punishments against any specific punisher, nor do they obviously reward punishers who try to discipline others. Their later behavior toward those who punished them appears mixed and context-dependent rather than rule-based. They neither clearly “forgive and move on” nor lock into persistent vendettas; their stance toward punishers is best described as situational and opaque, with low-confidence inference about underlying rules (unknown whether they mentally track “who started it,” or whether punishment against them shifts their beliefs about group norms).\n\n<REWARD>\nThis player is willing to reward, but in a restrained, targeted, and sometimes strategically ambiguous way. They reward when others contribute at high or improving levels or when they appear aligned with this player’s emerging coalition or norm preferences. They occasionally reward in periods of low overall cooperation, which may function as an attempt to encourage desirable partners rather than to enforce a strict contribution threshold. They never use reward as broadly or as intensely as some peers use punishment; their rewards are small, selective, and often paired with punishment of others in the same phase, consistent with a “carrot for allies, stick for violators” pattern. Given that rewards are payoff-neutral at the dyadic level in this mechanism, their use of reward appears more about social signaling (gratitude, alliance-building, or recognition of “good types”) than about pure payoff engineering. They do not systematically reward all high contributors, only certain ones, which suggests they incorporate history and identity (who it is) rather than acting purely on current contributions.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nWhen rewarded, this player does not show a clear, consistent pattern of reciprocation toward specific rewarders. They do not automatically reward back, nor do they clearly ramp up contributions solely because someone rewarded them. However, they sometimes show higher contributions or continued cooperative behavior in periods after receiving positive treatment from at least one other player, indicating that reward can support their willingness to stay cooperative in a group. Any direct “you rewarded me, I reward you” reciprocity rule is not evident; instead, their response seems more diffuse: rewards contribute to their overall willingness to view the group as cooperative and to maintain mid-to-high contributions. Specific dyadic reciprocity toward identifiable rewarders is uncertain (unknown).\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThis player pays close attention to others’ payoffs, as well as to how much they spend on punishment and reward. They appear to integrate three aspects of others’ outcomes: (1) contribution levels; (2) use of punishment/reward; and (3) resulting payoffs. They often alter their own contributions and sanctioning patterns after seeing strong deviations—particularly when one player engages in extreme or repeated punishment. They do not automatically support the “victim” or the “enforcer”; instead, they react to the overall balance of behavior. They sometimes punish or withdraw cooperation when they see harsh or excessive punishment, implying an aversion to perceived aggression or wasteful conflict. Conversely, they occasionally reward or increase cooperation when they see others bearing costs in ways that seem prosocial or aligned with cooperative norms. They are comfortable letting others suffer very large losses if those others have repeatedly behaved in ways they regard as problematic; large negative outcomes for such players do not trigger compensating rewards. In sum, they are sensitive to the social dynamics reflected in payoff streams and sanction costs, and they adapt strategy to the emerging pattern of “who is helping, who is harming, and who is disrupting,” rather than to payoffs alone.", "umap_x": 0.5452584028244019, "umap_y": -1.3504303693771362, "cluster_id": 6, "cluster_size": 31, "cluster_title": "Punishment / Reward / Contribution", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around punishment, reward, contribution, contributions, low."}
{"experiment": "5t4Ap8vtxqkcQ9zKZ", "participant": "mshD389BR2GypuzYY", "game_finished": true, "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a moderate, flexible contributor who oscillates between low, medium, and high contributions rather than following a simple monotone trend. They are neither a pure free rider nor a consistent high cooperator. Their contributions cluster around a medium level, with occasional full contributions and occasional zero contributions.\n\nTheir behavior is conditional: when others as a group contribute substantially, they reliably contribute at least a moderate amount, and sometimes increase their own contribution. When average contributions from others drop, they sometimes pull back to low or zero, suggesting sensitivity to group norms and perceived fairness.\n\nThey do not insist on strict equality in each period, since they sometimes contribute more or less than others without directly adjusting that same period. However, over time they seem to “test” different contribution levels while watching how others behave, which indicates a willingness to experiment rather than a fixed norm.\n\nRisk tolerance is moderate. They are willing to make large contributions even after having been punished heavily in previous periods, so they do not appear to be frightened into persistent low contributions. At the same time, they occasionally exploit cooperative periods by dropping their own contribution to zero while others give more, showing some opportunistic streak.\n\nOverall, their strategy is explorative and contingent: they try cooperative levels, then sometimes retreat to low contributions when group behavior is noisy, then return to medium‑high contributions when cooperation seems to revive.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThis player is clearly willing to punish and does so multiple times, but in a selective and patterned way rather than constantly. They rarely engage in “blind” punishment; when they punish, it is typically directed at either:\n\n- Apparent low contributors relative to the group, or  \n- A specific peer whose pattern they may view as harmful or antagonistic.\n\nThey occasionally punish all peers at once in a period when others contribute markedly less than they do, which looks like an attempt at norm enforcement across the board. At other times, they single out one individual whose behavior appears problematic to them, especially a player who uses punishment heavily or behaves erratically. They do not appear to punish high contributors when those high contributions are aligned with group cooperation.\n\nTheir punishment is not purely retaliatory: they do not systematically hit back every time someone punishes them. In several instances they absorb very heavy punishments from others without immediately targeting those particular punishers in the following decision. This suggests they are not driven primarily by personal revenge.\n\nInstead, their use of punishment appears closer to a mix of (i) weak norm enforcement against low or erratic cooperation and (ii) sporadic signaling when they feel contributions are too low. They show some willingness to invest in punishment even when it is costly to their immediate payoff, implying they care somewhat about shaping others’ behavior or expressing disapproval rather than only maximizing short‑run earnings.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nWhen punished, this player does not show a simple revenge or submission pattern. They experience both moderate and very severe punishments from others, yet their subsequent behaviors are mixed:\n\n- They do not consistently retaliate against the specific individuals who punished them, even when the punisher is clearly identifiable and used a large amount of punishment.  \n- They do not consistently lower their contributions in a stable way in direct response; sometimes they maintain or even raise contributions afterwards, sometimes they contribute less.  \n\nThis suggests a relatively high tolerance for being targeted. They appear to treat being punished more as background “noise” or as a group‑level environment feature than as a personal affront needing tit‑for‑tat retaliation. There is no clear evidence that they try to appease punishers specifically either; they do not tailor later rewards or special treatment to those individuals.\n\nOverall, they show limited personal reactivity to being punished: no strong vendetta behavior, no strong appeasement. Their adjustment seems more tied to the broader pattern of contributions in the group than to the actions of any one punisher.\n\n<REWARD>\nThis player uses rewards, but more sparingly than punishment. When they do reward, it is targeted and consistent with reinforcing cooperative or improved behavior. They choose high or clearly cooperative contributors as recipients when they are rewarding, and they also occasionally reward a player who appears to have shifted toward more helpful behavior after turmoil.\n\nThey never use rewards indiscriminately. They do not systematically reward every high contributor each period, but instead pick spots where a reward can plausibly signal approval or encouragement. This makes their reward usage look strategic rather than purely altruistic.\n\nGiven the technology (reward is not more efficient than direct giving), their willingness to pay for rewards indicates some preference for expressing approval and possibly for influencing future cooperation, even at a personal cost. However, the overall lower frequency of rewards compared to punishments suggests they lean more toward negative than positive sanctions as a means of shaping the group.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nWhen rewarded, they do not clearly change their subsequent behavior toward the specific rewarder in any systematic way. They sometimes receive rewards in cooperative contexts and continue contributing at medium‑high levels thereafter, but there is no strong indication that they direct extra rewards back to the person who rewarded them or offer protective behavior.\n\nThus, any reciprocity is at most implicit: they continue to engage in cooperation with the group as a whole rather than forming clear bilateral alliances. There is no evidence of targeted payback rewards or punishments based specifically on who has favored them earlier. Their response to being rewarded seems to be general maintenance of cooperative behavior rather than personalized reciprocity.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThis player pays attention to others’ payoffs and sanction budgets, as revealed by how their behavior tracks changes in contribution patterns and sanction intensity. Several tendencies emerge:\n\n- When others endure extremely high punishment costs or suffer massive deductions, the player does not automatically exploit the resulting chaos; instead, they continue to contribute at moderate or high levels in later periods, suggesting they are more focused on sustaining some level of group return than on capitalizing on others’ temporary deficits.  \n- They do not mirror the heavy punishers’ aggression: even after observing another player repeatedly spend large amounts on punishment, they do not adopt similar extreme sanctioning patterns.  \n\nTheir reactions to others’ sanction use are muted but structured. They sometimes add modest punishment of someone who has been aggressive or erratic, but they do not join in large sanction cascades. Likewise, when others spend on rewards, they do not automatically switch to high rewarding or seek to match that behavior.\n\nIn terms of outcomes, they appear to care that cooperation is not completely undermined: when average contributions from others are decent, they reliably contribute themselves. When group outcomes reflect high cooperation by some and severe sanctioning by others, they keep to a midline cooperative strategy, neither fully free‑riding on the turmoil nor over‑investing in sanctions.\n\nOverall, they come across as a conditional, moderately prosocial strategist who tests the environment, uses both punishment and reward in targeted ways, is relatively unreactive to personal sanctions, and orients their decisions more to overall contribution norms and perceived fairness than to short‑run payoff maximization alone.", "umap_x": 0.3440524935722351, "umap_y": -1.490358829498291, "cluster_id": 2, "cluster_size": 40, "cluster_title": "Punishment / Group / Contribution", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around punishment, group, contribution, reward, contributions."}
{"experiment": "5wPa3KXc3CN6CzKyT", "participant": "28u8gtGofWNb6zYyW", "game_finished": true, "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a highly volatile, opportunistic contributor who alternates between extreme free-riding and near-full cooperation. They do not follow a stable norm of “always high” or “always low” giving. Instead, they appear to treat contribution choices as a flexible lever for individual gain under changing social conditions.\n\nThey sometimes match or exceed the group’s high-cooperation standard by contributing almost their full endowment, but at other times they contribute almost nothing despite others continuing to give generously. These shifts do not map cleanly onto obvious retaliation or gratitude patterns; instead, they suggest an experimental or exploitative strategy: test how much they can earn by free-riding when others are cooperative, and switch back to high contributions when that also remains profitable or socially tolerated.\n\nThere is no strong evidence of a fairness norm such as “match the group average” or “match minimum contributors.” The player occasionally makes very low contributions even when everyone else contributes very high amounts, indicating low intrinsic aversion to advantageous inequality. At the same time, they are not a pure selfish optimizer, because they also choose full or near-full contributions in many rounds when free-riding would still be profitable. This mix points to a flexible, payoff-minded type that is willing both to cooperate and to exploit cooperation, rather than a principled cooperator or a consistent defector.\n\nRisk tolerance appears moderate to high: they repeatedly free-ride in a group where others heavily punish low contributors, absorbing substantial punishment deductions yet still returning to similar low-contribution behavior later. This implies either low sensitivity to social sanctions or a deliberate willingness to gamble on others’ continued generosity while accepting punishment as a cost of that strategy.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nNo chat content is available, so direct communication style is unknown. Given their behavior, they do not use the punishment/reward channels as communication devices either, since they never spend on either. They therefore present as a “silent observer/actor”: they respond behaviorally to the environment but do not visibly attempt to coordinate, persuade, or signal through the available mechanisms.\n\nResponsiveness to stated intentions, promises, or threats is unknown. Their pattern of alternating high and low contributions while remaining silent suggests a relatively independent, non-dialogue-based decision style: they appear to rely on their own payoff calculus and observed outcomes rather than joint planning or discussion.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThe player shows no straightforward “classic” end-game collapse toward persistent defection. In late rounds, they continue to mix high and very low contributions. Sometimes they give almost all of their endowment when the horizon is short; at other points, they return to full free-riding even as the game ends. This lack of a monotonic downward trend suggests that their decisions are not driven primarily by backward induction or a simple “cooperate early, defect late” logic.\n\nThey do seem aware of the remaining horizon in the sense that they continue taking sizable risks—both by free-riding and by fully cooperating—rather than converging to a single safe strategy. However, there is no clear pattern of escalating opportunism specifically tied to the last few rounds. If anything, their late-game choices remain as strategically mixed as earlier choices, indicating that end-game awareness does not strongly alter their underlying opportunistic-but-flexible style.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey never spend any coins on punishment, despite being repeatedly targeted by others’ punishment when they free-ride. This indicates either a strong reluctance to incur costs for norm enforcement, or a deliberate belief that punishing is not worthwhile or not their role. They refrain from punishing even obvious low contributors in the group, suggesting they are not a second-order enforcer of cooperation.\n\nBecause they are often the target of punishment and never retaliate with punishment themselves, there is no evidence of revenge motivation. They absorb sanctions without responding in kind through the punishment channel. Their reactive strategy, if any, occurs only via changing their own contribution behavior, not via sanctioning others.\n\nThe absence of any punishment outlays also implies they do not attempt to use punishment strategically (e.g., to deter future defection by others or to signal toughness). Deterrence motives thus appear weak or absent. Overall, they fit a “non-punisher” or “punishment-averse” type: willing to accept the group’s sanctions as a cost of their own mixed contribution strategy, but unwilling to pay to shape others’ behavior.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey never spend on rewards either, even in situations where the group is highly cooperative and some members expend substantial resources to reward or support others. This suggests that they do not see positive reinforcement as worth its cost, at least at the given reward technology.\n\nThere is no sign of gratitude signaling via rewards, nor of attempts to strategically strengthen cooperation by rewarding high contributors. Their cooperative episodes—where they contribute a lot—are not accompanied by rewarding others, indicating that their cooperation is expressed only through contributions, not through secondary prosocial tools.\n\nIn combination with zero punishment, this makes them a pure “non-intervenor” in the sanction/reward layer: they exploit or join cooperation purely through their own contribution choices, not by trying to reshape the incentive environment for others.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey are repeatedly punished when they contribute very little, and sometimes rewarded when they contribute more, but they never respond by adopting a stable cooperative norm. Instead, they continue alternating between high and low contributions even after clear evidence that low contributions attract costly sanctions and high contributions sometimes attract positive transfers.\n\nThis pattern suggests limited responsiveness to social feedback in the form of payoffs, punishments, and rewards. They do adjust behavior in the sense that high and low phases alternate, but the alternation does not monotonically follow incentives (e.g., “I was punished; now I’ll stay cooperative”); instead, they continue to revisit free-riding after having been heavily punished for it. This implies either that they discount social disapproval and costs relative to the benefits of opportunistic free-riding, or that they are experimenting with different behaviors to map out payoffs without strongly updating on each outcome.\n\nThey also observe others making large punishment and reward expenditures, but they do not imitate those behaviors. They do not appear inspired to become an enforcer or a rewarder even when those roles are salient and costly for others. They thus exhibit a relatively self-focused, non-imitative response style: others’ sanctioning activity affects their payoffs but does not recruit them into similar norm-enforcing roles.\n\nOverall, their behavioral profile fits an opportunistic, sanction-tolerant contributor who relies solely on personal contribution choices, largely ignores the punishment/reward instruments as tools, and shows only limited and inconsistent adjustment in response to the social incentives embedded in others’ outcomes.", "umap_x": -0.4644657075405121, "umap_y": -0.3398688733577728, "cluster_id": 4, "cluster_size": 43, "cluster_title": "Punishment / Contribution / Reward", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around punishment, contribution, reward, cooperation, behavior."}
{"experiment": "5wPa3KXc3CN6CzKyT", "participant": "DojC2G2FQwAxDKi7B", "game_finished": true, "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThe player is a stable, unconditional high contributor. They always give the full endowment to the public fund and never deviate, regardless of others’ behavior, punishment they receive, or the game’s progression. Their cooperation does not appear contingent on others’ past or current average contributions; they maintain the same choice when others free-ride heavily, when others converge to high contributions, and when the group becomes volatile. This suggests a strong internal norm for full cooperation rather than strategic adjustment based on marginal per-round payoffs. They tolerate clear inequality in payoffs (caused by both low contributors and heavy punishers) without reducing their own contribution, indicating low sensitivity to short-run exploitation risk and a strong preference—or commitment—to the socially efficient outcome. They do not appear to experiment with lower contributions even near the end, so there is no visible attempt to test whether others will carry the provision burden.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nunknown (no chat content is provided, so tone, persuasion style, and responsiveness in communication are not observable).\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThe player does not change their behavior as the horizon approaches; they continue full contributions in all late rounds. They also do not systematically reduce or escalate their use of punishment or reward near the end compared to mid-game. There is no visible exploitation of the final rounds by defecting, nor a last-minute surge of norm enforcement. This suggests either that they are not focusing on horizon-dependent strategic optimization, or that their guiding norm (“always fully cooperate, sometimes punish low contributors”) dominates any end-game considerations. Their approach is essentially time-invariant: they treat early, middle, and final rounds similarly in contribution and mostly similarly in punishment intensity.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThe player is a targeted, low- to moderate-intensity punisher who focuses on clear low contributors and ignores more ambiguous or moderate deviations most of the time. They never punish high contributors. Their punishment is consistently directed at players who contribute very little or nothing when others are contributing much more, especially recurrent low contributors. They sometimes also target a moderate under-contributor when behavior is especially stark relative to the group. They never punish out of apparent retaliation for being punished themselves: even after suffering non-trivial deductions, they do not direct punishment at those whose actions could plausibly have harmed them, and in some such situations they do not punish anyone. This pattern points toward norm-enforcing or inequality-averse motives rather than revenge. The player uses small punishment units and does not escalate across the game; they appear willing to incur some personal cost to discipline free-riders but do not adopt the very aggressive punishment levels that some others in the group use. They also clearly differentiate cases: recurrent complete free-riding or very low giving is punished, sporadic or moderate under-contribution often is not. Overall, they act as a principled but measured “mild altruistic punisher,” enforcing a cooperation norm without pursuing maximal deterrence.\n\n<REWARD>\nThe player never uses the reward option, even when others make very high or improving contributions and even when some peers spend substantial amounts rewarding. They receive rewards in several rounds but do not reciprocate, suggesting they are not motivated by gratitude signaling or by building reciprocal reward relationships. Given that the reward technology is inefficient for the giver relative to punishment, their behavior is consistent with a cost-effectiveness focus in sanctioning: they are willing to spend on punishment (which is powerful per unit) to deter or correct free-riding, but they decline to spend on the weaker, more expensive positive reinforcement mechanism. There is no evidence that they deploy reward strategically to stabilize high cooperation; their cooperation is offered regardless, and they appear to rely solely on punishment plus their own example rather than on formal rewarding.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThe player pays attention to others’ actions mainly through their contributions rather than through final payoffs or sanction expenditures. They do not appear to respond to others’ heavy punishment activity by joining in or by counter-punishing, nor do they mirror the reward-heavy strategies of some group members. When some players incur large costs on reward or punishment, the focal player’s own sanctioning pattern remains selective and relatively modest. Their willingness to continue full contributions despite seeing others gain higher or lower payoffs—sometimes due to punishment, sometimes due to free-riding—indicates that relative earnings and sanction-induced inequality do not drive their behavior. They do not appear to adjust contributions upward or downward in reaction to being punished themselves: after suffering sizable deductions, they still contribute fully and do not alter their punishment or reward behavior in any clear retaliatory way. This is consistent with a player who is anchored in a stable cooperation-and-norm-enforcement rule, largely insensitive to short-run payoff feedback from the environment.", "umap_x": 0.014502725563943386, "umap_y": -0.8597063422203064, "cluster_id": 4, "cluster_size": 43, "cluster_title": "Punishment / Contribution / Reward", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around punishment, contribution, reward, cooperation, behavior."}

They typically give the full endowment or close to it, with intermittent reductions to a mid-range level. These reductions do not track obvious free-riding by others: they still contribute generously when others partially defect, and they sometimes contribute less even when others are very cooperative. This suggests they follow an internal heuristic that favors near-full cooperation but allows some experimentation or self-protection, not a strict conditional-cooperator rule.\n\nThey show no clear pattern of retaliatory under-contribution in response to being punished or in response to low contributors. Even when some players starkly under-contribute, they continue to contribute at or near the maximum. This points to a relatively unconditional cooperative disposition, or at least a strong norm for maintaining the provision of the public good independent of short-term grievances.\n\nTheir behavior indicates awareness of efficiency: they repeatedly choose contribution levels close to the socially optimal full contribution, despite exposure to noise from punishment and reward. Risk tolerance appears moderate to high in social terms: they continue to “risk” contributing fully even when others occasionally defect, and they keep doing so near the end of the game, implying low fear of being exploited relative to their preference for sustaining the group benefit.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nUnknown. The transcript does not show any chat content, so tone, persuasion style, and responsiveness in communication are unobservable. Any claims about verbal coordination or affect are unknown.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThe player does not display the canonical end-game decay associated with finite-horizon reasoning. Contributions stay high in the final phase, including the last round, even when others around them partially or totally free-ride. There is no visible shift toward selfish exploitation as the final round approaches. Instead, their contribution pattern in the last few rounds is consistent with their earlier cooperative baseline, with only a modest mid-high contribution once amid otherwise full contributions. \n\nThey also do not “give up” on cooperation in the penultimate rounds when punishment chaos and heavy sanctioning among others becomes evident. This suggests either: (a) they place intrinsic value on adhering to a cooperative norm regardless of horizon, or (b) they have relatively weak (or noisy) backward-induction reasoning in this environment and instead apply a stable rule-of-thumb to “keep cooperating.”\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey almost never use punishment. Across the game they invoke it only once, targeting the most salient chronic defector rather than minor deviations. This solitary act looks like a principled sanction of a clear free-rider rather than ongoing retaliation or spite. After that episode, they abstain from punishment entirely, even when they themselves are punished or when other players visibly under-contribute or indulge in large-scale sanctioning.\n\nThis pattern indicates a very high threshold for punishing. They appear reluctant to engage in costly negative sanctions, perhaps due to a preference to avoid escalating conflict, an aversion to harming others, or a belief that others are already enforcing norms sufficiently. Since the one punitive act aligns with a clear case of low contribution, it looks more like norm-enforcement than revenge.\n\nThey also do not react with punishment when they become a punishment target. Being punished does not trigger counter-punishment, pointing to low propensity for retaliatory behavior and a relatively non-vengeful orientation.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey use reward selectively but in a highly nonstandard way. In most rounds they refrain from rewarding despite many others contributing at or near the maximum and despite reward being available from the start. When they do reward, they spend very substantial amounts on one specific low-contributing player who has been heavily punished by others. These rewards are not aligned with that player’s contribution level at the time; instead, they often arrive after that player’s contributions remain poor or only marginally improved.\n\nThis pattern suggests they use reward primarily as a counterweight to what they might perceive as excessively harsh punishment directed at a single group member, rather than as a standard reinforcement for prosocial behavior. The focal player effectively transfers a large portion of their own payoff to the ostracized player, absorbing a big personal cost. This indicates strong concern for equity or compassion for a scapegoated member, even at the expense of efficiency and their own payoff.\n\nThey also provide a small amount of reward once to a more cooperative peer, but this is minor compared to the repeated, substantial rewards directed to the previously low-contributing, heavily punished player. Overall, their reward behavior looks more like “protective support” for the marginalized than like systematic incentive management.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThis player appears highly sensitive to patterns of punishment and reward in the group, and to who is bearing costs. They do not react to isolated or symmetric punishments, but they respond strongly when one individual repeatedly suffers large deductions and is singled out by others. At that point, they commit significant resources to compensating that individual via reward. This indicates attention to distributional consequences and a possible dislike of group piling-on, not just to raw contribution levels.\n\nThey do not mirror others’ punitive intensity; even when several players spend heavily on punishment, they stay out of that arms race. Their own payoffs sometimes drop considerably as a result of their rewards, yet they do not attempt to “correct” this through later exploitation, reduced contributions, or counter-punishment. That implies a willingness to sacrifice personal earnings to reshape perceived unfair patterns in outcomes.\n\nWhen they themselves are punished or see their own payoff significantly reduced by others’ sanctioning, their strategy does not swing toward defection or retaliation. They maintain high contributions and no punishment usage. This stability suggests that they interpret punishment as either noise, group-level enforcement not worth fighting, or something that does not change their own normative stance.\n\nOverall, their type looks like an intrinsically cooperative, conflict-averse norm follower who is especially motivated to intervene when one member seems unfairly treated. They maintain high contributions throughout, eschew negative sanctions almost completely, and occasionally use costly positive transfers to shield a marginalized defector from extreme group punishment.", "umap_x": -0.1246073842048645, "umap_y": -1.2119114398956299, "cluster_id": 2, "cluster_size": 40, "cluster_title": "Punishment / Group / Contribution", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around punishment, group, contribution, reward, contributions."}

They usually contribute the full endowment or very close to it, even when others visibly free‑ride. Their contributions remain high across early, middle, and late stages, indicating that they prioritize maintaining group efficiency over exploiting others, and they do not substantially reduce contributions even after being personally targeted by punishment. They sometimes contribute slightly less than the group norm but still at a cooperative level, suggesting they are willing to take small personal gains without abandoning the public good. A single low contribution appears as an exception rather than a trend, implying either experimentation or a transient response rather than a shift in norm. Overall, their behavior is consistent with a strong fairness and efficiency norm (“everyone should contribute a lot”), with relatively low sensitivity of contributions to recent punishment or to the remaining number of rounds. Risk tolerance appears moderate: they repeatedly “risk” contributing fully even in the presence of chronic low contributors, relying more on punishment than on withdrawing cooperation.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nUnknown.

They also continue to use costly punishment in the last round against a chronic free‑rider, indicating that their enforcement of contribution norms does not shut down as the horizon approaches. There is no clear evidence that they discount future consequences of their actions; if anything, they act as if the cooperative norm and its enforcement are intrinsically valuable, independent of remaining rounds.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey are a frequent and relatively heavy punisher, especially toward clear under‑contributors. They target players who contribute nothing or very little when most others contribute a lot, and they do so even when many others also engage in sanctioning. Their punishment is selective: they do not punish moderate deviations consistently and focus on severe or recurring free‑riding and repeated zero contributions. They also direct punishment at players who alternately cooperate and defect in ways that significantly hurt the group, particularly when a player gives nothing while others give high amounts. They are willing to incur substantial personal cost to impose large deductions, demonstrating strong norm‑enforcement preferences that outweigh short‑term earnings. Punishment is not obviously retaliatory in the narrow sense: they do not punish every player who punishes them, and they sometimes continue to punish specific low contributors even after those players have been punished heavily by others, suggesting a focus on contribution behavior rather than on personal grievances. They do not appear to use punishment in a fine‑tuned, marginal way; instead, they sometimes choose relatively large sanction levels, consistent with a “tough enforcer” or “altruistic punisher” style aiming for deterrence and moral satisfaction more than precise cost‑benefit optimization.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey never reward anyone, despite many others using the reward mechanism and despite frequent high contributions by peers. This suggests either that they view the reward technology as too inefficient to justify use, that they believe high contribution is merely the expected norm and not something to be positively reinforced, or that they reserve all sanctioning effort for punishment rather than positive incentives. They also do not reciprocate rewards they receive; receiving small rewards does not trigger any visible change toward rewarding others. Overall, they rely exclusively on negative incentives to enforce cooperation and appear unwilling to spend resources on positive reinforcement.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey attend closely to others’ contribution levels and likely to their payoff consequences, as shown by the alignment of their punishment with large discrepancies between a player’s contribution and the group’s high norm. When a player earns high payoffs from low contributions, they respond with strong sanctions, suggesting aversion to others benefiting from free‑riding. They do not appear to punish or reward based on others’ use of punishment or reward alone; for example, they sometimes punish players who are punished by many others (piling on a free‑rider), but they do not systematically shield or counter‑punish on behalf of victims, nor do they specifically reward cooperative heavy punishers. They tolerate the fact that some players pour large amounts into reward or punishment, but their own actions remain anchored to contribution behavior rather than to peers’ sanctioning choices. Being themselves punished and rewarded multiple times does not lead them to visibly reciprocate or to retaliate: their contribution pattern stays cooperative, and their sanction pattern remains focused on the worst contributors rather than on those who harmed or helped them. This indicates a relatively impersonal, rule‑based response style: they act as if the central criterion is “How much did you contribute relative to others?” rather than “How did you treat me?”", "umap_x": -0.3892609477043152, "umap_y": -0.8913378119468689, "cluster_id": 2, "cluster_size": 40, "cluster_title": "Punishment / Group / Contribution", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around punishment, group, contribution, reward, contributions."}
{"experiment": "5wPa3KXc3CN6CzKyT", "participant": "PHoGZFjYHgjWPgQnB", "game_finished": true, "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a volatile, strategically experimental contributor who mixes high contributions with occasional full free-riding. They clearly understand that group cooperation is valuable (they frequently contribute at or near the maximum, especially when others are cooperating strongly), but they do not commit to a stable norm. Instead, they alternate between joining the cooperative majority and exploiting it.\n\nThey condition their behavior on others’ contributions: when peers are almost all high contributors, they sometimes match or exceed the group, and other times they drop to zero and ride on others’ efforts. They do not systematically “punish” low contributors through their own contributions; they continue to cooperate alongside obvious low contributors at several points, and sometimes reward them. This suggests that fairness norms (in the sense of strict contribution matching) are weak or secondary.\n\nRisk-wise, they tolerate large swings in their own payoff to test different strategies. They accept substantial payoff losses in some rounds (via free-riding plus becoming a target of punishment, or via heavy punishment spending in cooperative rounds) rather than maximizing steady earnings. This indicates a higher weight on expressive or strategic motives than on simple payoff security.\n\nOverall, their type is: a high-variance, payoff-sacrificing experimenter who alternates between cooperative and exploitative roles and seems comfortable deviating from both pure selfishness and pure fairness.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nUnknown. No chat content is provided, so their tone, direct persuasion attempts, and responsiveness in text channels are not observable. Their behavioral pattern (strong, sometimes costly reactions to others) suggests they might be expressive or confrontational if they did communicate, but this is speculative and cannot be confirmed.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThey show strong horizon awareness and a dramatic end-game shift. As the game approaches its last few rounds, they become more extreme and less payoff-oriented. They oscillate between full cooperation and full free-riding, and near the very end they unleash extremely heavy, broad punishment at large personal cost.\n\nThis pattern is consistent with “last-round venting” or moralistic expression: once future consequences and reputation no longer matter, they appear willing to sacrifice a large share of their remaining earnings to impose costs on nearly everyone, including high cooperators. The final round then reverts to passive free-riding without further sanctions, suggesting they treat the penultimate round as the main opportunity for cathartic or symbolic punishment and the very last round as a payoff grab.\n\nOverall, their end-game strategy is not a smooth decay of cooperation but a spike of aggressive sanctioning followed by payoff-focused free-riding, indicating horizon sensitivity and a willingness to use late rounds for expressive actions rather than efficiency.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThis player is highly willing to punish and accepts very large personal costs to do so. Early on, they target a clear low contributor with strong sanctions, consistent with norm-enforcing punishment. However, their later punishment becomes broader and less tightly tied to observed contribution levels.\n\nThey sometimes target fully cooperative or near-fully cooperative players with substantial punishment, even in otherwise cooperative environments. This indicates that their punishment is not purely contribution-based. Possible triggers (all low-confidence) include: perceived earlier targeting of themselves, irritation at specific players’ prior punishment or reward behavior, or a desire to equalize earnings among those who have done very well. Since punishers are anonymous, these attributions cannot be confirmed; the data only show that their punishment is not reserved for low contributors.\n\nAt one point, they punish nearly the entire group very heavily at extreme personal cost, while contributing nothing. This looks more like a “grim” or “scorched earth” move than calibrated deterrence: it dramatically lowers everyone’s payoff including their own, and there is no future round in which deterrence could benefit them meaningfully. This supports an interpretation of punishment as expressive, retaliatory, or driven by negative emotions, rather than purely strategic.\n\nSelectivity is thus mixed: they can be surgical (targeting select individuals) but also indiscriminate (hitting almost everyone). Deterrence motives seem weak compared to expressive ones; they do not consistently use small, cost-effective penalties to shape behavior. Instead, they sometimes overspend on punishment, indicating either limited concern for payoff efficiency or strong non-monetary motives.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey are willing to use reward, but in a sparse and idiosyncratic way. They sometimes reward players who contribute very little, as well as players who contribute very highly. This implies that reward is not a straightforward “payback for high contribution” tool.\n\nTheir rewarding of low contributors suggests a possible inclination toward inclusion or encouragement, or an attempt to cultivate allies among those at risk of being punished by others. It might also reflect sympathy for heavily punished players or a desire to moderate the group’s harshness toward deviants. However, these motives are speculative; all that can be stated confidently is that reward is not tightly aligned with contribution levels.\n\nThey also occasionally give small rewards to high contributors, which could be interpreted as gratitude signaling or reinforcement of cooperative behavior. Still, relative to punishment, reward plays a minor role in their strategy: they spend far more, and more often, on punishment than on reward. They thus use reward selectively and symbolically, while punishment is their primary social tool.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey appear highly reactive to others’ payoffs, punishments, and rewards, but not in a simple or stable way. When a low contributor is heavily punished by many others, they sometimes add their own punishment, aligning with the group norm. In other cases, they reward or refrain from punishing such a player, despite the group’s harsh stance. This suggests they are not simply following majority sentiment.\n\nThey also react to patterns of heavy punishment and reward directed toward others. At times they appear to counterbalance what others are doing—rewarding someone who is facing considerable punishment, or later punishing players who have themselves been active punishers or big earners. Because identities of punishers and rewarders are hidden, any inferred “retaliation” is low-confidence; empirically, we only see that relatively successful or central contributors are sometimes targeted by them despite cooperating.\n\nTheir willingness to drastically reduce everyone’s end-of-game payoffs implies that they care about relative outcomes and/or about expressing disapproval more than about preserving joint efficiency. They are not deterred by the fact that group punishment lowers the public good. Instead, they are willing to collapse efficiency to impose costs on others.\n\nIn summary, they are a strongly reactive, emotionally or norm-driven type who:\n- Cooperates often but not reliably.\n- Freely sacrifices own payoff to punish, including broad and costly punishment late in the game.\n- Uses reward sparsely and in a non-straightforward relation to contribution levels.\n- Responds to others’ outcomes in ways that suggest complex motives (possibly fairness, resentment, or moralism), but not simple conditional cooperation or pure self-interest.", "umap_x": -0.7528290152549744, "umap_y": -1.2490904331207275, "cluster_id": 2, "cluster_size": 40, "cluster_title": "Punishment / Group / Contribution", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around punishment, group, contribution, reward, contributions."}
{"experiment": "5wPa3KXc3CN6CzKyT", "participant": "emDjJ5MjdRyTzwaBw", "game_finished": true, "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a strict, unconditional full cooperator. They always contribute their entire endowment, without deviation, regardless of others’ behavior or the stage of the game. Their strategy does not react to variation in group average contributions, the presence of obvious free-riders, or signs of instability in others’ behavior. This strongly suggests they follow a fixed internal norm to “always contribute everything” rather than a conditional “cooperate if others do” rule. They tolerate repeated exploitation by low contributors without adjusting, indicating low sensitivity to relative payoff disadvantage and a willingness to accept being taken advantage of. Risk tolerance appears high in the sense of trusting the group despite clear evidence of opportunism. From a social preference perspective, they resemble a pure public-spirited type or strong altruist: they prioritize maximizing the group’s public good even when it is personally costly and not reciprocated.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nUnknown. There is no observable chat behavior in the transcript, so their tone, persuasion attempts, and responsiveness in communication cannot be inferred. It is also unknown whether their steadfast cooperation is accompanied by any verbal norm-appeals or if they remain silent.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThey show no end-game decay in cooperation. Their contribution pattern remains fixed and maximal through the final rounds, including when others increasingly deviate or when the remaining horizon is very short. They do not switch to self-regarding behavior when exploitation becomes severe or when punishment battles erupt among others. This indicates that they either do not weight the finite horizon strategically, or that their internal norm of full cooperation dominates any end-game incentives. They behave as if the number of rounds remaining is irrelevant to how one “should” act.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey never use punishment at any point, even when facing stark free-riding, repeated low contributors, or evidence that many others are actively punishing defectors. They absorb exploitation and later become a target of heavy punishment themselves, yet still do not retaliate. This points to a very strong aversion to inflicting costs on others, whether for deterrence or revenge. They also do not use punishment instrumentally to stabilize cooperation, despite punishment being relatively efficient, suggesting that maintaining a “non-harming” stance matters more to them than shaping others’ behavior. They appear neither a moralistic punisher nor a strategic enforcer; instead, they are a non-punishing cooperator, even when personally harmed.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey never use rewards either, despite having many opportunities to positively reinforce high contributors. Given that reward is very inefficient, this could reflect either an implicit cost-benefit awareness (reluctance to waste payoff on weak incentives) or a more general preference not to intervene in others’ outcomes at all. Combined with their refusal to punish, their pattern is consistent with a “non-interfering altruist”: they contribute fully to the public good but do not attempt to steer or evaluate others via secondary mechanisms. They do not appear to use rewards as gratitude signals or as a strategy to consolidate a cooperative coalition.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey observe others engaging in substantial punishment and reward activity: some players are repeatedly hammered with large deductions; others invest heavily in sanctioning or rewarding. Nonetheless, this has zero visible impact on their own behavior: they neither join in, nor mimic any pattern, nor adjust their contributions in response to who is being sanctioned or how much others spend. When they themselves are punished, they do not alter their strategy or begin punishing in return. This suggests a strong behavioral rigidity and independence from social feedback: they treat others’ payoffs, sanctioning choices, and conflicts as largely irrelevant to how they choose to act. Their underlying belief may be that one should simply “do the right thing” (full contribution) regardless of others’ payoffs and interventions, but that belief is inferred with low confidence since they never verbalize it.

They almost always give the maximum possible amount to the public fund, with only very small reductions on a few occasions. Their cooperation is stable over time rather than decaying, and persists even after facing repeated free-riding by specific others and being personally punished. They do not appear to condition their own contributions strongly on recent group averages or on being targeted by punishment; they maintain high giving even when others contribute much less, and even in the final rounds. This suggests a strong internal norm favoring full contribution and a willingness to accept being exploited rather than lower their own standard. They tolerate substantial payoff risk in order to keep cooperation high, indicating that sustaining the public good (and/or adhering to a fairness norm) matters more to them than maximizing short-run earnings.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nUnknown; no chat content is provided. Their social stance must be inferred from actions only.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThey show no clear end-game unraveling in their contributions. Even with full awareness of the round horizon, they continue to contribute at or extremely close to the maximum through the final rounds. If anything, their punitive behavior against known low contributors becomes more frequent and intense near the end, especially toward repeat free-riders. This pattern suggests that horizon awareness does not reduce their willingness to cooperate, and may instead increase their willingness to enforce contribution norms via punishment when there is little time left for reputation repair or learning.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey are a selective but willing punisher, clearly using punishment as a tool to enforce contribution norms rather than at random. They repeatedly target players who contribute very little or nothing to the public fund, especially when the rest of the group is contributing high amounts. They focus strongly on specific low contributors: one player who frequently gives nothing, and another who occasionally gives nothing amid high group contributions. They do not punish moderate under-contributors consistently, but they do escalate when someone moves from contributing a little to contributing nothing, or when a habitual free-rider reappears after periods of cooperation.\n\nTheir punishment is often multi-unit and therefore costly, particularly against repeat offenders. They sometimes punish the same individual multiple times across the game, including in the final round, suggesting a desire to sanction norm violators even when there is minimal future benefit from deterrence. They do not appear to use punishment in obvious retaliation for being punished themselves; after they are targeted by others’ punishment, their own targeting pattern continues to follow others’ contribution levels rather than becoming indiscriminate. This points toward “altruistic enforcer” motives: they accept personal cost to discipline free-riders and protect cooperative norms, even when they themselves are not guaranteed a payoff advantage from doing so.\n\nThey almost never punish high contributors or consistent cooperators, even when those players engage heavily in punishment or reward toward others. This indicates attention to fairness rather than spite: punishment is reserved for those clearly taking more than their fair share from the group project.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey never use the reward mechanism, despite many opportunities and despite witnessing others occasionally use it. This holds even when some peers contribute the maximum consistently and might be “deserving” from a reciprocity standpoint. Given that reward is structurally inefficient in this game (it costs more to give than the recipient gains), their behavior suggests they evaluate reward as not worth the cost, even for norm reinforcement. Their enforcement style is thus one-sided: they rely entirely on costly punishment to shape behavior, and do not invest in positive reinforcement or gratitude signaling. Any satisfaction they derive from cooperation enforcement seems to come from sanctioning defectors, not from actively subsidizing cooperators.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey are highly attentive to others’ contribution levels and adjust their punishment choices accordingly, but they do not visibly respond to others’ punishment/reward spending or payoff levels in their own contribution decisions. They continue to cooperate even when low contributors receive large net earnings in some periods (e.g., free-riders being heavily rewarded by others), and they continue to cooperate after audiences see them incur significant punishment costs or deductions. This indicates that their own giving is not contingent on short-run payoff fairness.\n\nThey also appear largely indifferent, in strategic terms, to the internal “wars” some other players fight through extensive punishment and reward spending. They do not join massive punishment campaigns against certain targets just because those targets are already under heavy fire; instead, they only punish when the contribution behavior itself justifies it by their standard. They likewise ignore opportunities to reward those who have been heavily punished but who are cooperating, even though others sometimes do so.\n\nWhen they themselves are punished, they do not shift into retaliation or lower their contributions; they maintain high giving and do not obviously punish their likely punishers. Given that punishers are anonymous, they could have responded with general or group-directed punishment, but they refrain. This further supports a principle-based pattern: their actions toward others are keyed to observed contribution behavior, not to how kindly or harshly those others treat them in payoff terms.\n\nOverall, this player type is a “principled high contributor and punisher”: they uphold a strong internal norm of full cooperation, remain generous regardless of exploitation or end-game, and selectively use costly punishment—never reward—to sanction clear free-riders, even at substantial personal cost.", "umap_x": -0.2625766694545746, "umap_y": -1.2531414031982422, "cluster_id": 2, "cluster_size": 40, "cluster_title": "Punishment / Group / Contribution", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around punishment, group, contribution, reward, contributions."}
{"experiment": "5wPa3KXc3CN6CzKyT", "participant": "uceMGeaNKkLFikxZX", "game_finished": true, "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a strongly cooperation-oriented contributor who usually gives the full endowment to the public fund. Their default is to contribute the maximum, and they sustain this across almost all rounds, including late in the game. They occasionally reduce contributions to a medium level but never free-ride; even in their lowest-contribution choices they still give a substantial share. Their behavior suggests a fairness norm that expects others to contribute at least moderately and treats zero or very low contributions as norm violations. Contribution levels are only weakly conditional: they do not systematically track small fluctuations by others, but they do sometimes lower their own contribution when they see persistent or egregious under-contribution from some group members. Risk tolerance for exploitation appears moderate: they are willing to keep contributing fully even after being punished themselves and even when some players under-contribute, but they do not perfectly ignore exploitation and occasionally hedge by contributing less. Overall, they behave like a near-unconditional cooperator with mild conditional adjustments rather than a purely strategic best-responder.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nUnknown; no chat content is available. Their style of action implies that if they do communicate, they likely emphasize norms and expectations around high contributions and express disapproval of low contributors through behavior rather than through positive reinforcement. Confidence about any specific communication tone or responsiveness is low due to missing chat data.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThe player does not display a standard end-game collapse in cooperation. They continue to contribute fully right up to the final round. Their punishment pattern also does not soften near the end; they still invest in sanctioning severe free-riding at the very end. This indicates clear horizon awareness (the number of rounds is visible) but little adjustment of cooperative intentions as the game closes. They treat late rounds as equally appropriate for enforcing norms, suggesting either a principled adherence to fairness or a preference for consistent behavior over purely payoff-maximizing exit strategies. There is no observable attempt to exploit the final rounds by free-riding.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThis player is a selective but willing punisher, best characterized as a norm-enforcing “moralist” rather than a vengeful or purely strategic punisher. They only ever punish clear low contributors, focusing on those who contribute zero or extremely little while others are giving much more. They target the same chronic low contributor repeatedly and also sanction another player when that player contributes nothing while the rest of the group is highly cooperative. They never punish high or typical contributors and do not appear to retaliate against those who punish them; when they themselves are heavily punished, they do not respond in kind. Their punishment intensity is moderate: they spend a nontrivial but not extreme portion of their payoff to impose substantial deductions, seemingly aiming at deterrence and norm reinforcement rather than maximizing harm. Over time, they reduce their own use of punishment when group contributions become broadly high and stable, and resume or maintain punishment only when free-riding reappears in stark form. They never use punishment opportunistically to suppress competitors’ earnings; their targets are consistently those whose contributions fall far below the emergent group norm.\n\n<REWARD>\nThe player never uses the reward mechanism. This holds even when others contribute at very high levels or correct earlier low contributions. They appear unwilling to pay a personal cost to provide small material rewards, possibly because the reward technology is highly inefficient, because they prioritize punishment as the primary tool of norm enforcement, or because they believe that high contributions are baseline obligations that do not merit extra compensation. There is no evidence that they ever attempt to strategically reinforce good behavior via rewards or to express gratitude monetarily.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThis player attends closely to others’ choices and the sanctioning environment. They track who is under-contributing and respond to those players’ outcomes by imposing or withholding punishment, not by adjusting contributions symmetrically or by rewarding others. When chronic low contributors suffer heavy punishment from multiple sources, the player does not intervene to protect them or to pile on gratuitously; their own punishment towards such players is consistent but not maximal. They are not visibly influenced by others’ use of costly reward: they neither imitate rewarding behavior nor reciprocate it when they themselves are rewarded. When they are punished and lose a noticeable amount of payoff despite full cooperation, they do not decrease their contributions, shift to retaliation, or switch to free-riding. Instead, they maintain high contributions and remain focused on sanctioning clear free-riders rather than those who punished them. Overall, they interpret outcomes mainly through the lens of contribution norms: large payoffs combined with low contributions are treated as illegitimate and targeted with punishment, while variability in payoffs driven by others’ punishment/reward spending does not alter their fundamental cooperative strategy or their choice of whom to sanction.", "umap_x": -0.5481294989585876, "umap_y": -0.8776029348373413, "cluster_id": 2, "cluster_size": 40, "cluster_title": "Punishment / Group / Contribution", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around punishment, group, contribution, reward, contributions."}
{"experiment": "5wPa3KXc3CN6CzKyT", "participant": "vSjLHzkwM4ZiaM944", "game_finished": true, "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a near-unconditional full cooperator for almost the entire game. They consistently give their entire endowment to the public fund, apparently treating maximum contribution as the appropriate norm regardless of others’ average behavior. Their cooperation is highly stable, not reactive to short-term changes in group contributions, punishment patterns, or their own payoffs. The only deviation is a single late-round defection where they contribute nothing while most others still contribute substantially; this appears tied to a desire to punish a chronic low contributor without further “subsidizing” them. Outside of that exception, they prioritize social efficiency over individual earnings and tolerate free-riding while continuing to contribute. Their behavior suggests a strong fairness and contribution norm—those who give much are acceptable, those who give markedly less are norm violators—but they enforce that norm primarily with punishment/reward rather than by adjusting their own contributions. Risk tolerance for being exploited is high; they accept repeat exposure to low contributors without reducing their own giving, and only once briefly switch to non-cooperation in a context of very salient frustration with a particular target.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nUnknown; there is no chat content in the transcript. Their social style must be inferred indirectly from actions. Their pattern of selective punishment and targeted rewards suggests they implicitly try to “communicate” norms through incentives rather than words. They appear to mentally track who cooperates well, who half-heartedly contributes, and who free-rides, and use reward/punishment as their main channel of expressing approval or disapproval. They do not seem to react directly to others’ use of reward/punishment through counter-sanctions, which hints at a relatively non-confrontational or non-retaliatory communication style, focused more on enforcing contribution standards than on personal vendettas.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThe player shows clear awareness of the game horizon. For most of the game, their contribution strategy is invariant to the remaining number of rounds, but in the last few rounds their sanctioning becomes sharper and more concentrated on major defectors. Near the end, they continue to fully contribute in most rounds despite the approaching final round, which indicates a persistent cooperative norm rather than simple repeated-game strategic cooperation. However, in the penultimate phase they momentarily drop to zero contribution while others still contribute highly and invest heavily in punishing a persistent low contributor. This suggests an end-game willingness to sacrifice both their own and others’ payoffs to deliver a strong final sanction when they expect limited future interaction. They then return to full contribution in the final round but continue punishing chronic low contributors, suggesting that even at the very end they want to uphold the cooperation norm symbolically. Overall, there is no smooth cooperation decay; instead, the end game triggers one sharp deviation used to intensify norm enforcement, followed by a final-round “return” to their identity as a full cooperator who still punishes defectors.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThis player is a frequent and principled punisher. They repeatedly spend on punishment across early, middle, and late game, even when it is personally costly and not obviously profitable. Their punishment is clearly conditional on others’ contribution behavior: they target those who give much less than the group and spare those who contribute at or near full. Free riders or near-free riders are punished early and repeatedly; moderate undercontributors are also targeted, though often with single units, suggesting a graded response. They do not appear to punish high contributors or engage in antisocial punishment. Their repeated targeting of specific low contributors (e.g., individuals who oscillate between low and zero contributions) indicates they track behavioral histories and attempt to correct persistent norm violators, not just one-off deviations.\n\nThey almost never punish in response to how others spend on punishment or reward; for example, they do not appear to retaliate against those who spend heavily on punishment more generally. This implies their motive is primarily second-order norm enforcement about contributions rather than revenge or score-settling. Over time, their punishment of certain chronic undercontributors becomes more insistent, culminating in a concentrated burst of punishment toward a player who repeatedly gives little or nothing. They are willing to pay substantial costs to reduce that person’s payoff even when that player is already being heavily punished by others, which suggests that “desert” and fairness matter to them independent of marginal deterrence effects. Relative to the technological leverage of punishment in this game, they often err on the side of using at least some units when they see low contributions, showing a low threshold for sanctioning norm violations.\n\n<REWARD>\nThe player uses reward selectively, less frequently than punishment, and always to recognize above-average or consistently high contributors. When they do reward, they spread small bonuses across multiple strong contributors rather than concentrating on a single individual, indicating a desire to broadly reinforce cooperative behavior. They never reward obvious free riders or people contributing far below the group, and they do not appear to reward in response to others’ punishment/reward spending (e.g., they do not “thank” punishers or compensate victims). Reward seems to function as a positive counterpart to their punishment: it is aimed at clear cooperators, especially when contributions are high and aligned with their full-cooperation norm.\n\nThey accept the poor efficiency of the reward technology; they still spend significantly to give relatively small payoffs to others, suggesting an intrinsic preference for acknowledging good behavior rather than strictly maximizing their own earnings. Over the game, they intermittently switch between rewarding and not rewarding as the group’s cooperation and punishment environment evolves, but they never abandon reward entirely. Their reward behavior appears strategic in a social sense (reinforcing norms), not in a narrow monetary sense.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThe player pays close attention to who ends up with high or low payoffs and how these payoffs arise. They respond to others’ outcomes primarily through the lens of contribution behavior rather than via envy or profit-maximizing strategies. High payoffs that are accompanied by solid contributions draw rewards or at least no sanctions. High or protected payoffs for those who contribute very little evoke punishment, even when those targets are already incurring substantial sanctions from others. This suggests that the player cares about relative justice and not just their own payoff difference; they want chronic low contributors to end up worse off, consistent with a strong norm-enforcing disposition.\n\nThey do not systematically punish players who spend heavily on punishment, nor do they visibly protect players who are victims of substantial punishment if those victims’ contributions are low or ambiguous. In contrast, they sometimes reward or leave untouched those who cooperate steadily even if those players face outside punishment, showing that their reference point is contribution, not punishment history. Across the game, their decisions imply that they interpret others’ aggregate outcomes (contributions plus sanction flows) as feedback about who respects or violates the cooperation norm and shape their own sanctions and rewards accordingly, but they remain largely insensitive to attempts by others to manipulate the social landscape through extreme punishment spending.\n\n", "umap_x": -0.3692336678504944, "umap_y": -1.0167503356933594, "cluster_id": 2, "cluster_size": 40, "cluster_title": "Punishment / Group / Contribution", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around punishment, group, contribution, reward, contributions."}

This pattern indicates a cooperative, efficiency-oriented type who is nonetheless not rigidly altruistic and is willing to keep some margin for themselves. There is no clear conditional tit-for-tat pattern tied to any single peer’s behavior; instead they seem to adopt a “default high” cooperative rule and only adjust modestly upward or downward, perhaps in response to aggregate noise or perceived instability.

There is no chat content in the transcript, so their tone, persuasion attempts, or responsiveness via messages cannot be inferred.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThis player shows little classic end-game defection. Their contributions remain high through the final phase and do not switch to pure self-interest, despite a finite, visible horizon. They continue to give substantially to the group until the last round and do not attempt a final-round payoff grab by dropping sharply. The only visible adjustment near the very end is a move from full generosity to slightly lower-but-still-high giving, which looks more like a mild recalibration than a strategic abandonment of cooperation. This pattern is consistent with a norm-following or intrinsically cooperative frame: the player seems to treat cooperation as a stable rule, not as something to abandon once future repercussions disappear.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey never spend on punishment, even when clear low contributors and aggressive punishers are present, and even when they themselves are repeatedly targeted. This indicates a strong aversion to using costly sanctions. They do not engage in second-order punishment of free-riders, nor do they retaliate against those who appear to be driving deduction storms in later rounds. The absence of any punishment use across cooperative, mixed, and chaotic episodes suggests that this is not just a narrow cost-benefit calculation in specific instances, but a consistent disposition or strategy: they avoid harming others, even when it might be emotionally or strategically justified. They therefore do not act as an enforcer of contribution norms and are unlikely to rely on punishment as a deterrence tool in new environments.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey never spend on rewards either, despite repeated instances where others make high or even perfect contributions and where some players lavish large positive transfers on cooperators. This reveals that they are not inclined to use costly prosocial incentives as a coordination or gratitude device. They appear content to let the public good mechanism itself do the rewarding, and they separate their cooperative contribution decisions from the more targeted, interpersonal incentive stage. Combined with their lack of punishment, this suggests a “non-interventionist” stance in the secondary mechanism: they participate in the core public good but deliberately stay out of interpersonal reallocations, possibly viewing them as inefficient, noisy, or strategically opaque.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThe player is repeatedly on the receiving end of deductions and occasional small rewards, despite remaining a high contributor. They do not visibly adjust their use of punishment or reward in response; they keep ignoring both tools. Their contribution level is also surprisingly robust to being sanctioned unjustly: after being targeted, they continue to contribute substantially and do not counter-defect or attempt to recoup losses via lower giving. They also observe episodes where some players burn large amounts of coins to punish or reward others, leading to dramatic payoff differences, but they do not imitate this behavior. Overall, their reaction to others’ outcomes is muted and conservative: they register that the environment is noisy and sometimes hostile, yet they stick with a straightforward cooperative strategy and do not join the escalation. This suggests a type who is resilient to provocation, reluctant to personalize sanctions, and focused on the underlying social surplus rather than on redistributive side-games.", "umap_x": -0.38763025403022766, "umap_y": -1.1779075860977173, "cluster_id": 2, "cluster_size": 40, "cluster_title": "Punishment / Group / Contribution", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around punishment, group, contribution, reward, contributions."}
{"experiment": "62jkonBJNwxE4uxCc", "participant": "KtJ2dtbsnY8kvizpC", "game_finished": true, "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a steadfast, unconditional high contributor. They always give the maximum allowed amount, with no deviation, regardless of how others behave or how the group’s contribution level fluctuates. Their pattern does not react to visible free-riding by some group members or to periods of lower total contributions; they continue to play as a pure cooperator. They appear to prioritize the social optimum or “doing the socially right thing” over individual payoff considerations, even when it is clear that some others are exploiting the public good. There is no evidence that they use contribution as a conditional response (e.g., rewarding cooperators or punishing defectors by changing their own contribution), and no sign of strategic endgame defection. This suggests a norm-driven or principle-driven cooperative type rather than a payoff-maximizing, risk-hedging, or reciprocity-based strategist.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThey do not speak in the chat at any point. They neither attempt to coordinate, persuade, nor question others, despite active conversation among other players about free-riders, bots, and possible experimenter intentions. This silence appears stable and deliberate rather than driven by inattention, because their contribution behavior is perfectly consistent and responsive to each decision screen. They do not defend themselves, accuse others, or comment on fairness, even when norms and potential “targets” are being discussed. This indicates a low-communication, low-engagement social style: they participate fully in the economic decision but abstain from social discourse. Their personality in this setting presents as reserved or indifferent to group chatter, with unknown underlying motives (could be shyness, focus on task, or belief that chat is irrelevant; data do not distinguish). They do not use communication to signal intentions or to enforce norms.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey never spend on rewards, even though they repeatedly receive rewards from others. Their zero-reward pattern is stable across high- and low-cooperation environments and across times when many others reward versus when almost no one does. This suggests that they do not use the reward tool either as reciprocity (thanking those who reward them or who cooperate) or as strategic reinforcement of prosocial behavior. It is unknown whether this is due to (a) strict payoff maximization regarding the reward mechanism, (b) a principle against manipulating others’ incentives, or (c) simple disinterest or confusion about the mechanism. However, the consistency across many opportunities makes confusion less likely and instead points to a simple rule: contribute fully but do not pay to reward. They implicitly separate their cooperative norm (contributing) from costly social sanctioning or thanking (rewarding), and keep the latter at zero.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey visibly experience that some members contribute nothing while others give the maximum, and that at various times some players spend substantial amounts on rewards. Despite this, they do not adjust either their contribution or reward behavior. They keep contributing fully even when free-riders reliably earn more in those rounds, and they refrain from rewarding even when others spend large sums on rewards that benefit them. There is no evidence of retaliation, conditional cooperation, or gratitude expressed through the available mechanisms or through chat. They also do not join the group in norm talk or in singling out suspected free-riders or bots. In effect, they register others’ outcomes enough to make informed decisions (since they continue to choose and confirm contributions), but they choose a fixed, internally anchored strategy rather than one that reacts to these observed payoffs and costs. Their type in new PGG environments is best characterized as a silent, principled full cooperator who ignores both exploitative behavior and prosocial reward behavior when deciding how to act.", "umap_x": 1.2104709148406982, "umap_y": 1.1122928857803345, "cluster_id": 7, "cluster_size": 36, "cluster_title": "Reward / Contributions / High", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around reward, contributions, high, rewards, contribution."}
{"experiment": "62jkonBJNwxE4uxCc", "participant": "PdiRTaqEcrsP7bY4j", "game_finished": true, "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a high, mostly unconditional cooperator with one brief exploratory defection. They almost always contribute the full endowment, even when several others clearly free‑ride and when they themselves get no additional rewards. The single zero contribution appears more like a test or momentary deviation than a strategic shift; after that, they immediately return to full contributions and maintain them to the end. Their behavior suggests a strong fairness norm that values everyone going “all in,” and they do not appear to condition their own giving on others’ recent behavior in a precise tit‑for‑tat way. They tolerate persistent inequality in payoffs without retaliating through reduced contributions. Risk tolerance is moderately high: they repeatedly commit to the socially optimal but individually risky choice despite visible free‑riding and the absence of punishment.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThey adopt a light, humorous, and socially engaged tone. They participate regularly in chat, make jokes, and reference broader context (e.g., being watched by researchers, “test” framing, playful sci‑fi and tech references). They show awareness of the experimental nature of the game and openly speculate about the designers’ intentions. They engage in soft coordination by affirming when group behavior aligns with cooperation and by verbally marking targets of suspicion, but they do so playfully rather than aggressively. They are responsive to others’ observations (e.g., about contribution patterns, bots, or bugs) and integrate these into their own comments, signaling that they follow the social narrative closely. Their style is affiliative rather than confrontational: they tease suspected free‑riders, but in a joking, group‑bonding way rather than directly blaming or moralizing.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey never spend any coins on reward despite having many opportunities and seeing others reward generously. This suggests a strong reluctance to incur personal cost for positive reinforcement, even toward consistent cooperators and even late in the game when they are wealthy. Their stance appears closer to “cooperate myself but let others handle rewarding,” rather than fully strategic rewarding. They nonetheless notice and appreciate when they receive rewards, but do not reciprocate materially. The absence of any reward behavior, even when cooperation is nearly universal, indicates that they do not use rewards as a tool to shape behavior or to express gratitude; their preferred way of encouraging cooperation is through communication and consistent own contributions, not through direct incentive payments.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey are attentive to others’ contribution histories and to patterns of free‑riding versus generosity. They publicly track who they see as non‑contributors and voice suspicion about them, sometimes aligning with others’ calls to “target” low contributors if a mechanism becomes available. Their comments show that they monitor not only contributions but also the oddity of someone giving large rewards while often not contributing, which they interpret as possibly non‑human or experimenter behavior. They interpret the overall interaction as a kind of social/behavioral experiment and respond with humor rather than frustration, even when inequality is obvious. The repeated free‑riding by some players does not lead them to reduce their own contributions, but it does affect how they talk about those players: mildly adversarial in words, cooperative in actions. They show no explicit emotional reaction to others’ payoffs as such; their focus is more on contribution patterns and “who’s playing fair” than on the raw payoff distribution. Overall, they are a stable cooperator who uses social commentary and group joking to deal with exploitation rather than adjusting their material strategy.", "umap_x": 0.6876432299613953, "umap_y": 1.5452238321304321, "cluster_id": 5, "cluster_size": 37, "cluster_title": "Reward / Cooperation / Contribution", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around reward, cooperation, contribution, free, contributions."}
{"experiment": "62jkonBJNwxE4uxCc", "participant": "ScDiiFoGyLcDYrQZf", "game_finished": true, "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a calculated, profit-focused conditional cooperator who freely-rides in many rounds but is willing to contribute fully when it does not threaten their overall advantage. They alternate between contributing nothing and contributing the full endowment, never using intermediate values, suggesting they adapt to a binary design rather than fine-tuned optimization. Early on, they exploit others’ full cooperation to gain a clear payoff advantage, indicating comfort with unilateral free-riding even when publicly visible and normatively disapproved by others. Over time, they increasingly match group cooperation when most others are contributing, especially once the environment stabilizes around high contributions; this suggests they recognize that high group contributions are collectively beneficial and are willing to participate when they already hold a payoff buffer. Their pattern does not appear random: they tend to free-ride when others are highly cooperative and rewards are being used generously, and they contribute when the group is cohesive and/or after having recently rewarded others. Overall, they prioritize personal earnings but are not rigidly selfish; they mix exploitation and participation in a way that preserves a high cumulative payoff while not fully undermining the public good.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThey remain completely silent in chat throughout, despite being repeatedly discussed and even explicitly called out. They never clarify, defend, or justify their behavior, nor attempt to coordinate strategies or norms. This indicates a low-engagement, low-communication style: they do not pursue influence, reassurance, or reputation management through words. Their silence persists even when other players speculate that they may be a bot or a researcher, which they ignore. This suggests either indifference to social impressions, an instrumental focus on the monetary/game outcome over social interaction, or a preference for anonymity and nonconfrontation. Because they do not verbally coordinate, any adjustment in their contributions or rewards must be inferred as internal strategy updates rather than responses to explicit negotiation.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey are an extremely active rewarder, repeatedly spending substantial portions of their payoff to give small, dispersed rewards to many or all other active players. They tend to give rewards even in rounds where they themselves contribute nothing, which shows that their rewarding is not contingent on their own cooperative behavior. Instead, they appear to use rewards as a tool to stabilize or encourage others’ cooperation: rewards are typically directed widely across the group, often favoring participants who contribute, and rarely if ever self-serving in a narrow sense. This pattern fits a “strategic rewarder–free-rider” hybrid: they invest in others’ satisfaction and cooperative inclination while continuing to maintain a personal contribution schedule that yields them high net payoffs. They do not use reward in a selective, reputation-building manner (e.g., favoring allies or punishing defectors indirectly); instead, their pattern looks like broad positive reinforcement of the group’s participation, even when they personally deviate. This suggests they accept significant personal cost to sustain a cooperative climate from which they can sometimes free-ride. Their willingness to spend repeatedly on rewards, despite never receiving corresponding rewards of similar magnitude, indicates they are not simply reciprocating; they appear comfortable acting as a unilateral reward provider to shape group behavior.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey closely track others’ behavior at the outcome level and adjust their actions accordingly, but entirely through contribution/reward choices rather than through talk. When others are consistently contributing, they are willing to join full cooperation at times, and they substantially reward those who do so, supporting a belief that high group contributions improve everyone’s earnings and are worth reinforcing. When some others defect or contribute less, they still tend to reward broadly, suggesting they prefer maintaining group cohesion over punishing or excluding low contributors. They show no direct hostility toward those who free-ride on the public good; instead of withdrawing rewards from suspected defectors, they generally keep them within the reward net. They do not react visibly when other players complain about “greedy” or “suspect” participants or when they themselves are labeled as under-contributing. This indicates a tolerance for being seen as exploitative and a focus on the aggregate payoff environment rather than on interpersonal approval. Overall, they treat others’ high contributions as something to be incentivized and sustained with rewards, while others’ criticism or speculation about their motives has no observable effect on their behavior.", "umap_x": 1.154839038848877, "umap_y": 0.4050891697406769, "cluster_id": 7, "cluster_size": 36, "cluster_title": "Reward / Contributions / High", "cluster_intro": "This cluster groups personas with related strategy patterns around reward, contributions, high, rewards, contribution."}
