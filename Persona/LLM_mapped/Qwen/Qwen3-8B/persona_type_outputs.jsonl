The player consistently contributes a large portion of their endowment, indicating a preference for collective benefit over individual gain. They appear risk-averse, maintaining a relatively constant contribution level despite the presence of punishment and reward mechanisms. There is no clear evidence of conditional cooperation based on others' contributions, suggesting a principled rather than opportunistic approach.\\n\\n<COMMUNICATION>\\nCommunication is minimal and non-confrontational. The player rarely engages in chat, and when they do, it is brief and neutral. They do not attempt explicit coordination or persuasion, nor do they respond to others' messages. This suggests a preference for action over dialogue, possibly due to a belief that cooperation can be achieved through consistent behavior rather than verbal negotiation.\\n\\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\\nAs the game progresses, the player maintains a stable contribution level, showing no significant end-game decay or escalation. They remain aware of the remaining rounds and adjust their behavior slightly in response to the changing horizon, but the overall pattern is steady. This indicates a forward-looking, horizon-aware strategy that prioritizes long-term group outcomes over short-term gains.\\n\\n<PUNISHMENT>\\nThe player is willing to punish, but selectively. They impose deductions in response to low contributions, indicating a deterrence motive rather than pure retaliation. Punishment is not used frequently, suggesting a cost-sensitive approach. The player does not target specific individuals repeatedly, implying a focus on behavior rather than personal vendettas. There is no evidence of escalating punishment over time.\\n\\n<REWARD>\\nRewarding behavior is rare and appears to be used sparingly. When rewards are granted, they are directed at players who contribute moderately, suggesting an attempt to reinforce positive behavior. The player does not use rewards as a primary tool, indicating a preference for punishment as a corrective mechanism. Rewards are not tied to extreme generosity, suggesting a strategic rather than purely altruistic motive.\\n\\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\\nThe player reacts to others' outcomes by adjusting their own contributions and punishment decisions. They observe that some players contribute little and respond with targeted punishment, while others contribute more and receive no reward. This indicates a sensitivity to group norms and a desire to maintain a cooperative equilibrium. The player does not engage in public criticism or praise, instead relying on private sanctions to influence behavior.\"},{\"id\":\"type_2\",\"text\":\"<CONTRIBUTION>\\nContribution tendency is moderate and somewhat volatile. The player alternates between high and low contributions, suggesting a conditional strategy that responds to others' behavior. They appear willing to sacrifice some payoff to support the group when others contribute generously, but they also free-ride when others are generous or when they perceive low overall contributions. This indicates a mix of fairness norms and opportunistic tendencies.\\n\\n<COMMUNICATION>\\nCommunication is active and cooperative. The player frequently engages in chat, using it to coordinate with others and express willingness to cooperate. They attempt persuasion by explicitly stating their intention to contribute and by encouraging others to do the same. They are responsive to others' messages, adjusting their behavior in response to both positive and negative signals. This suggests a socially oriented, norm-conforming personality.\\n\\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\\nAs the game nears its end, the player shows a slight increase in contribution, indicating a recognition of the final round and a desire to maximize group payoff. They also become more willing to punish in the last few rounds, suggesting a shift toward enforcing norms rather than pure cooperation. This indicates horizon awareness and a strategic adjustment to the end-game context.\\n\\n<PUNISHMENT>\\nThe player is willing to punish, but their use of punishment is selective and appears to be aimed at low contributors rather than free-riders. They impose deductions in response to low contributions, indicating a deterrence motive. However, they do not escalate punishment over time, and they sometimes refrain from punishing even when others contribute little, suggesting a cost-sensitive and somewhat forgiving approach. There is no clear evidence of retaliation against specific individuals.\\n\\n<REWARD>\\nRewarding behavior is rare and appears to be used sparingly. When rewards are granted, they are directed at players who contribute moderately, suggesting an attempt to reinforce positive behavior. The player does not use rewards as a primary tool, indicating a preference for punishment as a corrective mechanism.

Their contributions are stable across rounds, suggesting a commitment to the group rather than a reactive or opportunistic strategy. They appear to prioritize fairness and reciprocity, as they maintain high contributions even when others' behavior is mixed. They are willing to bear some risk by contributing heavily, which implies a moderate to high tolerance for uncertainty in the group's future behavior.\\n\\n<COMMUNICATION>\\nThis player is highly engaged and communicative, using chat to express both positive and negative reactions to others' actions. They are assertive in their tone, often directly addressing others' contributions and outcomes. They attempt to coordinate and encourage cooperation, sometimes framing their messages as advice or reminders. They are responsive to others' behavior, adjusting their communication style based on whether others are contributing or free-riding. They are not shy about expressing frustration when others act selfishly, but they also acknowledge and appreciate cooperative behavior.\\n\\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\\nAs the game progresses, this player shows a slight decrease in contribution levels, which may indicate a growing awareness of the finite horizon and a shift toward more self-interested behavior. However, they still maintain a relatively high contribution level, suggesting that they do not completely abandon cooperation even in the end game. They remain aware of the remaining rounds and adjust their strategy accordingly, balancing between maintaining group welfare and protecting their own payoff.\\n\\n<REWARD>\\nThis player is willing to use the reward mechanism to reinforce positive behavior, indicating a strategic understanding of how rewards can shape group dynamics. They are selective in their use of rewards, often reserving them for players who contribute consistently or who they perceive as cooperative. They do not appear to reward indiscriminately, suggesting that they are trying to encourage specific cooperative patterns rather than simply rewarding everyone. They also seem to use rewards as a form of social signaling, reinforcing norms of reciprocity and fairness.\\n\\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\\nThis player reacts strongly to others' outcomes, both positive and negative. When others contribute a lot, they acknowledge and appreciate this, sometimes expressing gratitude or praise. When others free-ride or contribute little, they express disappointment or frustration, indicating that they are sensitive to inequity and reciprocity. They are also attentive to the costs and rewards that others incur, suggesting that they are trying to understand the trade-offs others are making. They do not appear to engage in punishment, but they do use rewards strategically to influence behavior.\"},{\"id\":\"type_2\",\"text\":\"<CONTRIBUTION>\\nThis player is a conditional cooperator who adjusts their contributions based on the group's overall behavior. They start with a moderate contribution and gradually increase it as the game progresses, indicating a willingness to invest more when they perceive others as contributing. Their contributions are relatively stable once they reach a higher level, suggesting a preference for maintaining a cooperative stance rather than fluctuating based on short-term incentives. They are willing to bear some risk by contributing more than the minimum, which implies a moderate tolerance for uncertainty in the group's future behavior.\\n\\n<COMMUNICATION>\\nThis player is generally cooperative and supportive in their communication, using chat to encourage others and express appreciation for contributions. They are responsive to others' actions, often acknowledging positive behavior and sometimes offering advice or encouragement. Their tone is positive and constructive, with a focus on maintaining group harmony.

They remain aware of the remaining rounds and adjust their strategy to maintain a cooperative profile, even as the immediate incentive to free-ride increases. This suggests a long-term orientation toward group welfare rather than short-term self-interest.\\n\\n<REWARD>\\nThis player is willing to use the reward mechanism to reinforce cooperative behavior, but they do so selectively. They appear to reward players who contribute consistently or who they perceive as cooperative, using rewards as a way to encourage and maintain positive interactions.

Their contributions are stable across rounds, suggesting a commitment to the group rather than a reactive or opportunistic strategy. They appear to prioritize fairness and reciprocity, as they maintain high contributions even when others' behavior is mixed. They are willing to bear some risk by contributing heavily, which implies a moderate to high tolerance for uncertainty in the group's future behavior.\\n\\n<COMMUNICATION>\\nThis player is highly engaged and communicative, using chat to express both positive and negative reactions to others' actions. They are assertive in their tone, often directly addressing others' contributions and outcomes. They attempt to coordinate and encourage cooperation, sometimes framing their messages as advice or reminders. They are responsive to others' behavior, adjusting their communication style based on whether others are contributing or free-riding. They are not shy about expressing frustration when others act selfishly, but they also acknowledge and appreciate cooperative behavior.\\n\\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\\nAs the game progresses, this player shows a slight decrease in contribution levels, which may indicate a growing awareness of the finite horizon and a shift toward more self-interested behavior.

They also seem to use rewards as a form of social signaling, reinforcing norms of reciprocity and fairness.\\n\\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\\nThis player reacts strongly to others' outcomes, both positive and negative. When others contribute a lot, they acknowledge and appreciate this, sometimes expressing gratitude or praise. When others free-ride or contribute little, they express disappointment or frustration, indicating that they are sensitive to inequity and reciprocity.

They are willing to bear some risk by contributing even when others are free-riding, indicating a moderate to high tolerance for risk in the context of group cooperation.\\n\\n<COMMUNICATION>\\nThis player is highly communicative and expressive, using chat to both coordinate and persuade others. They frequently engage in positive reinforcement, encouraging cooperation and expressing appreciation for others' contributions. Their tone is warm and supportive, aiming to build a cooperative atmosphere.

They are selective in their punishment, targeting those who contribute little or nothing while maintaining a relatively high level of cooperation themselves. Their punishment is not purely retaliatory; they seem to use it as a deterrent rather than a purely vengeful response.

However, they do not punish everyone who deviates, which implies some tolerance for moderate defection and a focus on strategic deterrence.\\n\\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\\nWhen this player is punished, they respond with a mix of compliance and strategic adjustment. They do not immediately retaliate, which suggests a preference for forgiveness and a desire to avoid escalating conflict. Instead, they appear to internalize the punishment and adjust their behavior in subsequent rounds, increasing their contributions to signal a commitment to cooperation. They also use communication to explain their actions and justify their continued cooperation, indicating a desire to maintain social harmony and rebuild trust with the group.\\n\\n<REWARD>\\nThis player is willing to reward high contributors, reinforcing cooperative behavior. They use rewards strategically, targeting those who consistently contribute a large share of their endowment. Their rewards are not random; they appear to be based on observable patterns of behavior rather than arbitrary favoritism.

They acknowledge the reward and express appreciation, which reinforces the positive social signal. They also appear to reciprocate by maintaining or increasing their contributions, aligning their behavior with the rewarder's incentives. This suggests a strong norm of reciprocity and a willingness to engage in mutual benefit. They do not retaliate against the rewarder, indicating a preference for positive reinforcement and a desire to sustain cooperative relationships.\\n\\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\\nThis player is attentive to others' outcomes and adjusts their behavior accordingly. They observe who contributes more and who contributes less, and they use this information to guide their own contributions and punishment/reward decisions. They are sensitive to the costs and benefits others experience, which suggests they are aware of the trade-offs involved in cooperation and punishment.

They do not reward everyone equally, indicating a selective and strategic approach to reinforcement.\\n\\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\\nWhen this player is rewarded, they respond with gratitude and increased cooperation. They acknowledge the reward and express appreciation, which reinforces the positive social signal. They also appear to reciprocate by maintaining or increasing their contributions, aligning their behavior with the rewarder's incentives. This suggests a strong norm of reciprocity and a willingness to engage in mutual benefit. They do not retaliate against the rewarder, indicating a preference for positive reinforcement and a desire to sustain cooperative relationships.\\n\\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\\nThis player is attentive to others' outcomes and adjusts their behavior accordingly. They observe who contributes more and who contributes less, and they use this information to guide their own contributions and punishment/reward decisions.

This indicates a strong reciprocal norm and a tendency to form or reinforce alliances with cooperative partners. They are identifiable as a rewarder to others, and their behavior suggests that they value and respond to recognition and positive reinforcement. They do not engage in retaliatory behavior against rewarders; instead, they reinforce the positive dynamic by continuing to contribute and by rewarding others in turn, which supports a cooperative and trusting group environment.\\n\\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\\nReactions to others' payoff outcomes are primarily normative and cooperative. When others contribute more than the minimum, the player is positively influenced and tends to match or exceed those contributions, indicating a desire to align with high contributors. When others contribute less, the player is more likely to reduce their own contributions, signaling disapproval of free-riding behavior. They are attentive to the costs and benefits others incur, and they adjust their behavior in response to both high and low contributions. They do not engage in punishment, so their response to low contributors is primarily through reduced cooperation rather than direct sanctions. Overall, they prioritize group efficiency and fairness, adjusting their own contributions to reflect their assessment of the group's cooperative level.\"},{\"id\":\"type_6\",\"text\":\"<CONTRIBUTION>\\nContribution tendency is high, with a strong preference for contributing the maximum amount. The player appears to be an unconditional cooperator, maintaining high contributions regardless of others' behavior, indicating a strong fairness norm and a willingness to bear personal costs for the group's benefit. They do not show volatility in contributions; even when others contribute less, they continue to contribute the maximum, suggesting a principled stance rather than a reactive one. Risk tolerance is low in the sense that they prioritize group payoff over individual payoff, accepting lower personal payoffs to ensure higher group returns. Overall, they are a pure altruistic cooperator, focused on maximizing the group's total payoff rather than their own individual gain.\\n\\n<COMMUNICATION>\\nCommunication is cooperative and normative, with a clear intent to encourage high contributions and maintain group cohesion. The tone is positive and supportive, often framing contributions as a shared responsibility and a moral obligation. They engage in coordination attempts by explicitly calling for maximum contributions and by acknowledging others' efforts. They are responsive to others' messages, adjusting their own behavior in response to both positive and negative feedback. They avoid confrontational language and instead use persuasion and appeals to fairness. Engagement style is active and constructive, with a clear intent to guide the group toward a fully cooperative equilibrium.\\n\\n<REWARD>\\nWillingness to reward is moderate but strategic. The player occasionally uses the reward mechanism to reinforce cooperative behavior, particularly when they observe others contributing at or above the group average. Rewards are used to signal appreciation and to encourage continued high contributions, indicating a desire to maintain or enhance the group's overall payoff. They do not reward every instance of cooperation, suggesting a selective reinforcement strategy rather than indiscriminate generosity. The player also appears to be aware of the cost of rewarding, balancing the benefit to the group against the personal cost, and is willing to incur this cost when it aligns with their cooperative goals.\\n\\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\\nWhen rewarded, the player responds with gratitude and reciprocation, often increasing their own contributions in subsequent rounds to align with the rewarder's behavior.

They appear to prioritize group welfare over individual gain, indicating a strong fairness norm and a willingness to bear personal cost for collective benefit. Their contribution is stable and not conditional on others' behavior, suggesting a principled rather than opportunistic approach. They seem to tolerate some free-riding without retaliating, which may reflect a belief in the possibility of future cooperation or a low sensitivity to short-term defection.\\n\\n<COMMUNICATION>\\nThey engage in communication that is generally positive and encouraging, aiming to reinforce cooperation and maintain group harmony. Their tone is supportive and non-confrontational, with a focus on mutual benefit and shared goals. They do not appear to use communication for strategic manipulation or punishment threats, instead emphasizing collective effort and fairness. They respond to others' contributions with appreciation and encouragement, indicating a responsive and socially attuned style.\\n\\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\\nAs the game approaches its end, this player maintains their cooperative strategy without significant change. They do not appear to engage in end-game defection or escalation, suggesting a stable, long-term cooperative orientation rather than a last-minute opportunistic shift. Their awareness of the finite horizon does not lead to a breakdown in cooperation, indicating a belief in the value of sustained cooperation even when future interactions are limited.\\n\\n<PUNISHMENT>\\nThis player is reluctant to punish, even when others contribute less than the maximum. They do not impose penalties on free-riders, which may reflect a preference for forgiveness, a desire to avoid conflict, or a belief that cooperation can be maintained through positive reinforcement rather than punishment. They do not use punishment as a deterrent or retaliatory tool, suggesting a more tolerant and trusting disposition.\\n\\n<REWARD>\\nThey are willing to reward others who contribute highly, using the reward mechanism to reinforce cooperative behavior. Their rewards are targeted at high contributors, indicating a strategic intent to encourage and sustain high contributions. They do not reward low contributors, which suggests a selective and conditional reward strategy based on observable prosocial behavior. Their use of rewards appears aimed at maintaining group cohesion and encouraging continued cooperation rather than at signaling gratitude alone.\"},{\"id\":\"type_2\",\"text\":\"<CONTRIBUTION>\\nThis player is a conditional cooperator who adjusts their contributions based on the group's overall behavior. They tend to contribute more when others are also contributing generously, and they reduce or stop contributing when they perceive that others are free-riding. This suggests a sensitivity to the social context and a desire to maintain a fair balance between personal cost and group benefit. They are willing to bear some personal cost to support the group, but they are not a pure altruist; they appear to monitor the group and adjust their own behavior accordingly.\\n\\n<COMMUNICATION>\\nTheir communication is strategic and somewhat confrontational. They use chat to express dissatisfaction with low contributors and to encourage higher contributions, indicating a desire to influence group behavior. They are responsive to others' contributions and do not shy away from calling out free-riders, which suggests a normative stance that cooperation is expected and that deviations from this norm are worth addressing. Their tone is firm but not overly aggressive, and they occasionally offer positive reinforcement to those who contribute well, indicating a mix of corrective and supportive communication.\\n\\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\\nAs the game nears its end, this player becomes more cautious and less willing to contribute at the maximum level. This suggests a horizon-aware strategy: they are more willing to take risks and invest in the group when future interactions are uncertain. They appear to prioritize short-term gains and self-preservation in the final round, indicating a shift from long-term cooperation to a more self-interested stance. However, they do not completely defect; they still contribute a moderate amount, showing some residual concern for group welfare even in the end game.\\n\\n<PUNISHMENT>\\nThis player is willing to punish free-riders, especially when they perceive that others are not contributing their fair share. They use punishment as a deterrent rather than as a purely retaliatory tool, aiming to maintain group cooperation and fairness. They are selective in their punishment, targeting those who contribute very little while ignoring moderate or high contributors. This suggests a belief that punishment should be reserved for clear violations of the cooperative norm rather than used as a general threat. They do not engage in excessive punishment, indicating a balance between enforcing norms and avoiding unnecessary conflict.\\n\\n<REWARD>\\nThey are willing to reward high contributors, using the reward mechanism to reinforce cooperative behavior. Their rewards are targeted at those who consistently contribute at or near the maximum level, indicating a desire to encourage and sustain high contributions. They do not reward low contributors, which suggests that they view rewards as a way to reinforce the cooperative norm rather than as a general incentive. Their use of rewards appears strategic, aimed at maintaining group cohesion and encouraging continued cooperation, rather than at signaling gratitude alone.\"},{\"id\":\"type_3\",\"text\":\"<CONTRIBUTION>\\nThis player is a free-rider who consistently contributes the minimum amount in each round. They appear to prioritize personal gain over group welfare, indicating a strong self-interested orientation. Their contribution is stable and not conditional on others' behavior, suggesting that they do not adjust their strategy based on the group's actions. They are willing to take advantage of others' contributions without reciprocating, which reflects a low level of fairness concern and a high tolerance for exploitation. They do not show any signs of increasing contributions in response to others' generosity, indicating a lack of reciprocity or conditional cooperation.\\n\\n<COMMUNICATION>\\nTheir communication is minimal and non-confrontational. They do not engage in explicit coordination attempts or persuasion, and they do not respond to others' contributions or to calls for cooperation. Their tone is neutral and does not include expressions of gratitude, frustration, or encouragement. They appear to avoid direct engagement with the group, which may reflect a desire to minimize social interaction or a lack of interest in influencing others. They do not use chat to signal their own strategy or to justify their low contributions, suggesting that they are not motivated to explain or defend their behavior.\\n\\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\\nAs the game approaches its end, this player continues their low-contribution strategy without any noticeable change. They do not escalate cooperation or attempt to compensate for earlier free-riding, indicating that they do not adjust their behavior based on the remaining rounds. Their horizon awareness does not lead them to increase contributions; instead, they maintain their self-interested pattern, suggesting that they do not value future interactions enough to change their strategy. They do not show any signs of last-minute cooperation or attempts to improve the group's outcome.\\n\\n<PUNISHMENT>\\nThis player is unwilling to punish others, even when they observe that some players contribute more than the minimum. They do not use the punishment mechanism at all, which suggests a low willingness to enforce norms or deter free-riding. They do not appear to be motivated by a desire to maintain fairness or to protect the group from exploitation. Their lack of punishment may reflect a belief that others should bear the cost of maintaining cooperation, or it may simply reflect a preference for avoiding the personal cost of punishment. They do not engage in retaliatory punishment, indicating that they do not use punishment as a tool for revenge or deterrence.\\n\\n<REWARD>\\nThey are unwilling to reward others, even when they see high contributors. They do not use the reward mechanism at all, which suggests that they do not see a benefit in reinforcing cooperative behavior through positive incentives. Their lack of reward may reflect a general indifference to social norms or a belief that rewards are unnecessary in a cooperative environment.

They frequently express encouragement and appreciation for cooperative behavior, which suggests a desire to reinforce pro-social norms and build a positive group atmosphere. They also use criticism and warnings when others defect, indicating a normative stance that cooperation is expected and that defection is socially unacceptable.

They do not engage in random or tit-for-tat punishment; instead, they seem to use punishment as a tool to maintain group cooperation, rather than as a purely retaliatory response. They are not overly aggressive in punishment, which suggests a desire to avoid escalating conflict and to maintain a cooperative group environment.\\n\\n<REWARD>\\nThis player is willing to reward cooperative behavior, using rewards to reinforce positive contributions. They do not reward every act of cooperation, indicating that they are selective in their use of rewards rather than indiscriminately rewarding everyone. They appear to use rewards strategically to encourage continued cooperation, rather than as a simple expression of gratitude. They do not use rewards as a substitute for punishment, suggesting that they view rewards and punishment as complementary tools for shaping group behavior. They are responsive to others' contributions, rewarding those who contribute more, which indicates a belief that higher contributions deserve recognition and reinforcement.\"},{\"id\":\"type_12\",\"text\":\"<CONTRIBUTION>\\nThis player is a conditional cooperator who contributes a moderate amount of their endowment. Their contributions are relatively stable over time, indicating a consistent cooperative stance rather than a highly volatile or opportunistic strategy. They appear to be sensitive to the behavior of others, as they sometimes reduce contributions when others defect, suggesting that they adjust their behavior in response to the group's overall level of cooperation. They do not fully free-ride, even when others defect, indicating a preference for maintaining some level of cooperation rather than exploiting the group. They seem to balance self-interest with a concern for group welfare, as they contribute enough to benefit the group but not so much that they appear overly altruistic. They are not risk-averse, as they continue to contribute even when others defect, showing a willingness to bear some risk of being exploited.\\n\\n<COMMUNICATION>\\nThis player is generally positive and supportive in communication, using encouraging and appreciative language to reinforce cooperation. They frequently acknowledge others' contributions and express gratitude, which suggests a desire to build a cooperative and friendly group atmosphere. They also use warnings and reminders about the importance of cooperation, indicating that they are normative and concerned with maintaining group standards. They are responsive to others' messages, engaging in dialogue and adjusting their tone based on the group's behavior. They do not engage in aggressive or confrontational communication, instead favoring persuasion and appeals to shared goals. They sometimes use humor or light-hearted comments, which may serve to reduce tension and maintain a positive tone.\\n\\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\\nAs the game progresses, this player maintains a relatively stable level of cooperation, suggesting that they do not experience a strong end-game effect that leads to defection. They do not significantly increase or decrease contributions in the final rounds, indicating that they either do not anticipate the end of the game or are motivated by long-term group outcomes rather than short-term gains. They continue to contribute moderately even when others defect, showing that they do not escalate cooperation at the end but also do not fully free-ride. They appear to be aware of the remaining rounds, as they sometimes reference the number of rounds left, but they do not use this awareness to dramatically change their strategy. Overall, they maintain a consistent cooperative stance throughout the game.\\n\\n<PUNISHMENT>\\nThis player is willing to punish defectors, but they are selective and restrained in their use of punishment. They do not punish every instance of defection, suggesting that they are not purely retaliatory but rather use punishment strategically to deter free-riding. They appear to target persistent or repeated defection rather than isolated incidents, indicating a belief that punishment should be reserved for those who consistently violate cooperative norms. They do not engage in random or tit-for-tat punishment; instead, they seem to use punishment as a tool to maintain group cooperation, rather than as a purely retaliatory response. They are not overly aggressive in punishment, which suggests a desire to avoid escalating conflict and to maintain a cooperative group environment.\\n\\n<REWARD>\\nThis player is willing to reward cooperative behavior, using rewards to reinforce positive contributions.

Reward is available: it costs 4 coins to grant 5.0 coins of reward (tech 1.25). Players cannot see how many rounds remain. Players can see each other's end-of-round outcomes, including payoffs, punishment costs and deductions, reward costs and grants. Punishers are not identifiable.

There is no clear evidence of conditional cooperation; they do not appear to adjust contributions based on others' behavior.

The player occasionally imposes punishment, but not frequently, suggesting a cautious approach to sanctioning. Punishment is used primarily in response to low contributions by others, indicating a deterrence motive rather than retaliation. They do not punish high contributors, implying a focus on correcting free-riding rather than punishing cooperators. The player appears to balance the cost of punishment against the potential benefit of maintaining group cooperation, and they do not engage in indiscriminate punishment.\\n\\n<REWARD>\\nWillingness to reward is low and appears to be absent. There is no evidence of the player ever using the reward mechanism, suggesting either a lack of incentive to reward or a belief that rewards are unnecessary in this environment. The player does not seem to use rewards to reinforce cooperative behavior or to signal gratitude, indicating a preference for direct contribution over indirect incentives.\\n\\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\\nThe player reacts to others' outcomes primarily through contributions and selective punishment. When others contribute little, they respond by increasing their own contribution and, when appropriate, by imposing punishment. When others contribute more, they do not adjust their own contribution or use rewards, suggesting that they do not feel a need to reciprocate with rewards.

They do not condition contributions on others' actions, indicating a principled rather than opportunistic stance. They tolerate moderate defection without significant reduction in their own contributions, suggesting a forgiving or tolerant attitude toward free-riders.

Overall, they embody a 'generous cooperator' type, focused on maintaining group cohesion and fairness rather than maximizing personal payoff.\\n\\n<COMMUNICATION> They engage in positive, encouraging, and normative communication, often framing cooperation as a shared goal and emphasizing fairness and mutual benefit. They use language that appeals to collective responsibility and moral obligation, such as 'we all have to contribute' or 'it's not fair if only some people give.' They are responsive to others' contributions, acknowledging when others contribute and sometimes expressing gratitude or approval. They avoid direct confrontation or blame, instead using indirect persuasion and appeals to shared values. They are not overly verbose but are consistent in their messaging, reinforcing cooperative norms throughout the game. They do not engage in strategic or manipulative communication; their tone is sincere and cooperative.\\n\\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME> As the game progresses, they maintain a stable, high level of contribution without significant decay or escalation. They do not appear to be strongly influenced by the end of the game in terms of reducing contributions, suggesting that they value long-term group outcomes over short-term gains. They do not show a clear 'end-game effect' such as free-riding or increased defection; instead, they continue to act in a cooperative and principled manner even as the horizon shortens.

They do not seem to internalize the punishment as a personal attack, and they do not use it as a justification for further defection. Their response is consistent with a 'forgiving cooperator' type: they tolerate punishment from others and do not let it undermine their cooperative stance. They may implicitly understand that punishment is a tool for maintaining group norms, and they accept that some members will use it, but they do not reciprocate in kind.

Contributions are multiplied by 11.5 (MPCR 0.61). Chat is disabled. Punishment is not available. Reward is not available. Players cannot see how many rounds remain. Players can see each other's end-of-round outcomes, including payoffs. Punishers are not identifiable. Rewarders are not identifiable.\n\nREQUIRED_HEADERS:\n<CONTRIBUTION>\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\n\nHeader expectations (include but not limited to):\n- <CONTRIBUTION>: general contribution tendency, stability vs volatility, conditionality, fairness norms, risk tolerance.\n- <RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>: reactions to others' payoff outcomes, including costs spent and deducted/granted via punishment/reward.\n\nTask: generate N distinct player 'types' for this PGG, including but not limited to incentives, strategies, beliefs, and personality. Ground every claim in plausible observed behavior for this environment, but DO NOT cite specific rounds, quotes, or numeric evidence. The generated types are intended to serve as prompts defining player types in new PGG environments. Use present tense throughout. Avoid redundancy; do not repeat the same trait or rationale across sections. Each type must be distinct from the others.\nOutput format: JSON only. The JSON must have a top-level key 'types' with a list of N objects. Each object must have keys 'id' and 'text'.

When others' payoffs are low, they do not engage in any observable punishment or reward, as punishment and reward mechanisms are not available. They do not appear to use others' outcomes to signal or enforce norms, and they do not seem to adjust their behavior in response to others' outcomes in a way that would be detectable through observable actions. Their reactions are thus primarily internal and not expressed through any available game mechanisms.\"}]}"}

Contributions are multiplied by 11.5 (MPCR 0.61). Chat is disabled. Punishment is available: it costs 2 coins to impose 3.0 coins of deduction (tech 1.5). Reward is not available. Players cannot see how many rounds remain. Players can see each other's end-of-round outcomes, including payoffs, punishment costs and deductions. Punishers are not identifiable. Rewarders are not identifiable.\n\nREQUIRED_HEADERS:\n<CONTRIBUTION>\n<PUNISHMENT>\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\n\nHeader expectations (include but not limited to):\n- <CONTRIBUTION>: general contribution tendency, stability vs volatility, conditionality, fairness norms, risk tolerance.\n- <PUNISHMENT>: willingness to punish, triggers, selectivity, deterrence vs retaliation motives.\n- <RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>: reactions to others' payoff outcomes, including costs spent and deducted/granted via punishment/reward.\n\nTask: generate N distinct player 'types' for this PGG, including but not limited to incentives, strategies, beliefs, and personality. Ground every claim in plausible observed behavior for this environment, but DO NOT cite specific rounds, quotes, or numeric evidence. The generated types are intended to serve as prompts defining player types in new PGG environments. Use present tense throughout. Avoid redundancy; do not repeat the same trait or rationale across sections. Each type must be distinct from the others.\nOutput format: JSON only. The JSON must have a top-level key 'types' with a list of N objects. Each object must have keys 'id' and 'text'.

When others are contributing, the player is willing to contribute more, indicating a positive response to cooperative behavior. When others are not contributing, the player is willing to reduce their own contributions, suggesting a negative response to free-riding. The player is attentive to the payoffs of others and the costs they incur, but does not consistently use this information to punish. Instead, the player appears to focus on their own payoff and the overall contribution level, rather than on specific instances of punishment or reward.

The player does not consistently contribute the maximum amount, indicating a willingness to free-ride when others are also contributing. There is no clear fairness norm driving contributions; instead, the player appears to be opportunistic, adjusting contributions based on the perceived behavior of others. The player is willing to contribute more when others are contributing, but also willing to reduce contributions when others are not contributing, suggesting a conditional strategy. Risk tolerance is low, as the player sometimes contributes less than the maximum, possibly to avoid the risk of being exploited by free-riders. Overall, the player behaves as a conditional, opportunistic contributor who balances cooperation with self-interest.\\n\\n<PUNISHMENT>\\nWillingness to punish is low. The player rarely imposes punishment, even when others are clearly free-riding. This suggests a reluctance to bear the cost of punishment, even when it could deter free-riding. The player does not appear to use punishment as a deterrent; instead, the player seems to avoid punishment altogether, possibly due to a low willingness to incur personal costs.
