Here are 15 clusters of behavioral codes in the provided list. A behavioral code is a piece
of natural language that describes motivations behind strategic behaviors. Please summarize these
behavioral code clusters into extended titles.

CRITICAL REQUIREMENT: Each title MUST be between 8-15 words. Count carefully.

The summarized cluster titles should be:
(1) 8-15 words in length (strictly enforced)
(2) understandable and descriptive
(3) semantically relevant to the behavioral codes inside the clusters
(4) well covering the whole cluster
(5) distinguishable from other clusters
(6) generalizable - avoid information specific to this game scenario

Examples of good extended titles:
- "Conditional cooperators who match group contributions and punish free-riders consistently"
- "Strategic defectors who reduce cooperation when others contribute less to maximize payoff"
- "Unconditional high contributors who maintain full cooperation despite others' free-riding behavior"

Before output, review each title and count the words to ensure 8-15 word requirement is met.
Please output the cluster names in lines, followed by the summarized titles (e.g., "cluster 00-496: ...").
