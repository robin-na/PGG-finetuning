        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is an unstable, opportunistic free-rider with intermittent cooperation. They alternate between full contribution and full defection rather than choosing intermediate levels (which are not available here), and they do not settle into a consistent cooperative or non-cooperative regime.\n\nThey sometimes contribute fully even when others’ average contributions are relatively low, and sometimes free-ride when others are contributing a lot. This indicates weak conditional cooperation: they do not reliably match the group’s behavior, and their own pattern shows no clear upward or downward trend; instead it is volatile and context-insensitive.\n\nThey tolerate substantial inequality in their favor, repeatedly taking high private payoffs while others contribute more. They also occasionally accept very poor personal payoffs when choosing to contribute and punish heavily, suggesting that immediate monetary maximization is not their sole priority.\n\nFairness norms are weak or inconsistent. They show no clear pattern of “if most others contribute, I will too” or “if most defect, I will defect.” Their contribution choices do not consistently reward cooperators or punish defectors through contribution behavior itself.\n\nRisk tolerance appears moderate to high: they are willing to expose themselves to negative or very low round payoffs (especially in combination with heavy punishment) without an observable adaptive correction toward safer, lower-variance strategies.\n\nOverall, they act as a noisy, self-regarding player who occasionally experiments with cooperation but does not anchor on a stable pro-social or purely selfish strategy.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThis player is an unusually heavy and sometimes extreme punisher, with a pattern consistent with antisocial or spiteful punishment rather than norm-enforcing punishment.\n\nThey frequently spend large amounts on punishment, sometimes to the point of driving their own payoff into strongly negative territory. This shows that they are willing to sacrifice considerable personal income purely to reduce others’ payoffs. Such willingness is hard to reconcile with purely instrumental, payoff-maximizing motives; it is more consistent with emotional or expressive motives (e.g., spite, frustration) or with a distorted notion of “justice” that does not track contributions.\n\nTheir targeting is not aligned with standard reciprocal fairness norms. They do not focus their punishment selectively on low contributors or consistent free-riders. In several instances, they punish players who are contributing fully or more than they are. This lack of alignment with contribution levels indicates that punishment is not primarily used to enforce cooperation norms.\n\nThey also do not display a clear deterrence strategy: there is no observable tightening or relaxing of punishment in line with changes in others’ behavior, nor a consistent focus on repeat low contributors. Instead, the pattern looks erratic and high-intensity, with large punishment bursts directed at specific individuals at different times.\n\nSelectivity is low: when they do decide to punish, they sometimes punish multiple players and at high intensity, rather than carefully choosing minimal-cost interventions. Given the cost-benefit ratio of punishment, their choices often reduce their own payoff without producing obvious strategic benefits.\n\nTaken together, their punishment profile suggests a “spiteful / antisocial punisher” type: willing to incur costs to harm others, not reliably linked to contribution norms, and with little evidence of strategic calibration.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nThis player receives punishment on multiple occasions from various others. Their behavioral response does not indicate compliance or accommodation: after being punished, they do not reliably shift toward the punisher’s apparent norm (for example, they do not consistently move from free-riding to contributing, nor from heavy punishment to restraint).\n\nThere is also no clear pattern of targeted retaliation against identifiable punishers. Although punishers are identifiable, the player’s punishment behavior is too broad and erratic to cleanly infer tit-for-tat responses. Sometimes they later punish players who had previously punished them, but they also punish players who did not punish them and fail to punish some past punishers. Because of this inconsistency, any retaliatory motive is at best low-confidence and mixed with other motives.\n\nThey show no visible “forgiveness” dynamic: punishment from others does not lead them to stop punishing those individuals, nor to adopt more cooperative contributions toward them. Instead, their own punishment and contribution patterns continue in a similarly volatile manner regardless of who has sanctioned them.\n\nOverall, they appear relatively insensitive to being punished in terms of strategic adjustment. They neither consistently appease punishers with cooperative behavior nor reliably escalate against them; they continue following their own idiosyncratic pattern.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThis player observes detailed end-of-round outcomes, including others’ payoffs, punishment expenditures, and received deductions, yet their subsequent behavior does not seem systematically guided by these outcomes.\n\nThey do not clearly reward players who sacrifice payoff to enforce cooperation, nor do they consistently ally with, imitate, or avoid heavy punishers. Similarly, they do not preferentially protect high contributors from punishment; they repeatedly allow or participate in environments where cooperators are heavily punished without adjusting their own contribution or punishment strategy to stabilize the group.\n\nThey appear largely unconcerned with the efficiency of group outcomes. They sometimes choose actions (especially heavy punishment combined with contribution) that drive total welfare down and harm themselves, even when others are already incurring large costs. There is no sign that they shift toward more restrained behavior when they see others generating very low or negative payoffs through aggressive punishment, nor that they exploit this chaos in a reliably payoff-maximizing way.\n\nTheir reaction to others’ extreme punishments is thus best characterized as indifferent or opportunistic rather than coordinated or norm-driven. They do not emulate high-earning strategies consistently, nor do they react to others’ misfortunes with protection or restraint. If anything, they sometimes contribute nothing and avoid punishment, letting others bear the cost of chaotic sanctioning while they collect high free-rider payoffs.\n\nIn summary, this player processes others’ outcomes in a way that does not translate into stable reciprocity, coalition-building, or efficiency-seeking. Their type is a volatile, opportunistic free-rider with a strong antisocial punishment streak, low responsiveness to sanctions, and minimal regard for group welfare or coherent norm enforcement."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a strongly cooperative, norm-focused contributor who usually gives the full endowment to the public fund. Their default is to maintain very high contributions even as others occasionally lower theirs. They only reduce their own contribution a few times, and those reductions are modest relative to full free-riding, suggesting discomfort with deviating too far from a fairness norm rather than a shift to pure self-interest.\n\nTheir cooperation is conditionally tied to perceived group norms rather than to short-term payoff maximization: they continue to contribute fully even when average contributions dip and when they personally suffer substantial punishment. They do not appear to condition contributions strongly on having received rewards or punishments; contribution levels are remarkably stable despite large shocks. This points to a principled, rule-based cooperation style rather than responsive tit-for-tat.\n\nThey show mild willingness to shade contributions downward when group averages and some individual contributions fall, but they never exploit very low-contributing peers to take large private gains. Risk tolerance appears moderate: they accept repeated exposure to potential punishment rather than reshaping their contribution behavior to avoid being targeted, implying either confidence that their high contributions are justified or relative indifference to strategic image management via contribution choices alone.\n\nFairness norms are strict and demanding: they seem to view full or near-full contribution as the proper standard for others, and they keep adhering to that themselves even when others deviate. They appear more willing to use the punishment mechanism to enforce norms than to use their own contributions as leverage.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nAwareness of the finite horizon does not produce a classic end-game unraveling in this player. They maintain full contributions through the final rounds, including the last one, showing no systematic cooperation decay. Instead of cutting contributions as the end approaches, they escalate enforcement via punishment. Near the end, they dramatically increase the intensity of sanctions on certain targets while still contributing fully.\n\nThis pattern suggests that they treat the final rounds as an opportunity to “settle accounts” or reinforce norms rather than to exploit others. They do not appear to adopt a backward-induction logic that would lead to selfish behavior as the game ends. If anything, they become more aggressive in disciplining those they see as repeated norm violators, using the end game to deliver large, possibly symbolic punishments. Overall, horizon awareness changes their punishment strategy more than their contribution level.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThe player is highly willing to incur substantial personal costs to punish others, especially repeat or extreme under-contributors relative to a high-contribution norm. They frequently target specific individuals who persistently contribute less than what the player seems to regard as acceptable. Targets are not random: they focus on those who deviate downward from an implicit full-contribution standard and who do so repeatedly over time.\n\nThey distinguish between moderate and severe norm violations. When another player contributes somewhat below the apparent norm, they often apply mild, repeated punishment, suggesting an attempt at calibrated deterrence. When a peer contributes very little or zero, especially if this happens multiple times, the player escalates to very large punishment expenditures. This escalation shows a strong “strong reciprocator” or altruistic-punisher tendency: they are willing to sacrifice significant payoff to impose very large costs on defectors.\n\nTheir punishment is primarily norm-enforcing rather than payoff-optimizing. They continue to punish even when the marginal effectiveness of punishment is uncertain and when punishment is extremely expensive for them. They also maintain high contributions while punishing, which indicates that the motive is not simply to reduce defectors’ relative advantage but to enforce a cooperative standard.\n\nSelectivity is clear: they usually ignore small, one-off deviations and instead concentrate on a few players whose contributions repeatedly fall short or who oscillate between compliance and mild defection. This suggests they track histories and are sensitive to patterns over time. There are a few instances where they punish a player who has not clearly defected recently, indicating either low tolerance for any earlier deviation, a delayed response to past rounds, or possible confusion about recent contribution histories; confidence in this interpretation is low.\n\nThey do not appear to punish for personal retaliation against those who punish them: when they themselves are targeted, there is no clear, immediate counter-punishment against the likely punisher. Their punishment behavior therefore looks more like impersonal norm enforcement than vendetta.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nWhen the player is punished, they do not obviously retaliate through counter-punishment, nor do they significantly reduce their own contributions in response. Their behavior after being punished stays highly cooperative and norm-enforcing, and they continue to direct sanctions at third-party under-contributors rather than at whoever targeted them.\n\nBecause punishers are identifiable, the absence of clear counter-punishment suggests that they either: (a) interpret punishment of themselves as a possible mistake or as noise; (b) prioritize group-level norm enforcement over personal revenge; or (c) do not track or respond to individual-level hostility in a tit-for-tat manner. They also do not show evidence of “compliance” in the sense of changing their strategy to align with a punisher’s apparent preferences; instead they persist with their own high-contribution, high-punishment strategy.\n\nOverall, they appear relatively forgiving or at least non-retaliatory toward punishers, and they show a strong commitment to their own normative rule-set despite receiving negative feedback. Precise beliefs about why they were punished are unknown.\n\n<REWARD>\nThe player shows very low usage of the reward mechanism. They reward a high contributor once early in the game but then almost never spend on rewards again, despite frequent observation of others who also cooperate at high levels. They do not systematically reward consistent high contributors or those who increase their contributions after punishment episodes. Rewarding behavior is therefore rare, unsustained, and not clearly part of a stable strategy.\n\nGiven that rewarding is institutionally inefficient (costly to the rewarder and relatively weak in effect), their strong preference for punishment over reward suggests they see negative sanctions as the primary tool for shaping behavior, rather than positive reinforcement. They prioritize punishing defectors over supporting cooperators, even when the group is already relatively cooperative. This implies a “stick over carrot” enforcement style, with rewards, when used, serving at most as occasional, perhaps exploratory, signals rather than a core component of their strategy.\n\nTheir single clear reward instance targets a high-contributing peer, suggesting they conceptually link reward to exceptional cooperation, but the fact that they do not repeat this pattern later indicates they either deem it too costly or too ineffective, or they focus so heavily on defectors that they choose not to allocate resources to rewarding.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nWhen the player is rewarded, they maintain or resume high contributions, but since high contributions are already their default, it is unclear whether the reward causally affects their behavior. There is no discernible attempt to reciprocate directly to the rewarder via counter-reward, nor do they appear to form a special “alliance” or favor network in response.\n\nThey also do not lower punishment of under-contributors after being rewarded; their norm-enforcement style persists unchanged, and they continue to sanction defectors aggressively. This suggests that, while they may appreciate being recognized (unknown), they do not update their broader enforcement or contribution strategies in a visible way because of rewards. Reciprocity toward rewarders is either absent or too subtle to detect in this data.\n\nOverall, the player behaves as a principled, high-contribution enforcer type: they anchor on a strict cooperation norm, maintain it across the entire game, and rely heavily on costly punishment—rather than reward, retaliation, or end-game defection—to manage the social environment."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThe player is a strict, unconditional full contributor. They always allocate their entire endowment to the public fund in every round, with no visible sensitivity to others’ average contributions, to fluctuations in cooperation, or to their own realized payoffs. They behave as if full contribution is a fixed rule or moral standard, not a strategic choice. They do not shift contributions downward in response to repeated free-riding by specific players, nor upward (which is impossible here) to respond to high cooperation; instead, they hold a stable, maximal-cooperation line throughout.\n\nThey appear unconcerned with short-run monetary return from the contribution stage itself. Despite seeing the MPCR and the opportunity to gain more by cutting back when others under-contribute, they never exploit that option. This suggests either a strong fairness/cooperation norm that overrides payoff maximization, or a view of the contribution decision as separate from the payoff calculus—possibly because they intend to correct unfairness via punishment rather than via their own contribution choice.\n\nTheir risk tolerance in contribution is high: they fully cooperate even when others’ behavior is unstable and when they have already been “burned” in payoff terms by doing so. They do not hedge or partially reduce contributions to insure against low group contributions. Conditional cooperation, if present, does not show up in the contribution level; instead, their conditionality manifests almost entirely in their use of punishment and occasional reward.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nAwareness of the game horizon does not lead them to reduce contributions; they continue full cooperation through the final round. There is no standard end-game decay in the contribution stage.\n\nIn the sanctioning stage, their approach in late rounds remains intense and norm-focused rather than exploitative. They continue to spend substantial amounts on punishing perceived defectors even when there is no future round in which deterrence could pay off. They also keep targeting repeat low contributors consistently to the very end. This willingness to incur large, non-recoverable costs at the horizon strongly suggests that they value enforcing norms or expressing disapproval more than they value maximizing cumulative payoff in the final rounds.\n\nThey do not appear to “cash in” their position as a high contributor by relaxing norms or free-riding once the end is near. Instead, they maintain the same pattern: maximal cooperation plus heavy, targeted sanctioning. This indicates a stable preference profile rather than a forward-looking, purely strategic adjustment to the approaching end.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThe player is a highly punitive, norm-enforcing type, willing to spend very large portions of their payoff to punish what they interpret as low or inconsistent cooperation. They use punishment frequently, in most rounds, and sometimes at very high intensity. The pattern of targets and magnitudes shows several distinct features:\n\n- Primary targets are chronic or salient under-contributors. One particular peer who repeatedly contributes zero or very low amounts is punished heavily and persistently across many rounds. Another peer who oscillates between moderate and very low contribution is also punished repeatedly, with especially large punishment in rounds where that peer contributes far below the group.\n- Occasional under-contributors or those sharply below the emerging high-cooperation norm (for example, contributing noticeably less than the majority but not necessarily zero) also receive punishment, though generally at more moderate levels.\n- The player sometimes extends punishment to multiple low contributors in the same round when the overall group cooperation drops, directing sanctions across several peers who are below what looks like their internal standard.\n\nThe punishment does not appear to be retaliatory in response to being directly harmed by identifiable individuals, because punishers are anonymous and the player is never directly targeted in a way that could be clearly traced to particular peers. Instead, their pattern is consistent with second-order norm enforcement: they punish deviations from a high-contribution norm regardless of personal retaliation opportunities.\n\nThey regularly punish at levels that seriously reduce their own payoff for that round, clearly sacrificing income to impose large deductions on defectors. They sometimes do this even when others are also punishing the same targets, which indicates they are not merely “filling a gap” but are independently motivated to ensure a strong negative consequence for low contribution.\n\nTheir punishment is selective rather than random. They rarely, if ever, punish high contributors. When a previously low contributor later matches group norms more closely, the player sometimes reduces or suspends punishment, but if they regress, the player quickly resumes punishing, often strongly. This quasi-contingent pattern fits a type who aims to deter low cooperation and reinforce a target contribution level.\n\nBecause the punishment technology is favorable (high impact per unit), their behavior also fits “altruistic punisher” or “moralist” types from experimental literature: they personally incur substantial costs to enforce pro-social norms that benefit the group, even when anonymity prevents any reputational return and even at the end of the game when deterrence value is minimal.\n\n<REWARD>\nThe player uses rewards sparingly, but in a systematic way. Compared to the frequency and magnitude of punishment, reward is infrequent and modest. When reward occurs, it follows two main patterns:\n\n- Occasional positive reinforcement of previously low or questionable contributors who have clearly shifted to higher contributions, especially one peer who was a major defector earlier but later contributes more. The player twice provides small rewards to this peer in rounds where that peer’s contribution level is high or has improved, suggesting an attempt to encourage and stabilize cooperative behavior rather than simply destroy their payoff.\n- Occasional small rewards to consistently high contributors or to several strong cooperators at once in a round where overall contributions are high. In one instance, the player disperses small rewards across several high contributors simultaneously, which looks like a group-wide “thank you” to those adhering to the cooperative norm.\n\nThey never reward under-contributors. Reward is strictly conditional on above-average or improving behavior. Given that the reward mechanism is “inefficient” (it costs more than it transfers), their willingness to use it at all indicates that they care about signaling approval and trying to shape future behavior, even at a cost. However, because they use punishment far more often and more heavily than reward, their social control strategy is predominantly negative reinforcement with only occasional positive reinforcement.\n\nThe asymmetry suggests they see punishment as the primary tool for norm enforcement, with reward as a secondary, supportive tool used to bolster allies or to encourage turnarounds from prior defectors. They are not a “warm glow” rewarder; reward is purposeful and targeted, not generous or frequent.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThe player pays close attention to others’ contributions and realized payoffs and adjusts sanctioning patterns accordingly, but without changing their own contribution level. Their decisions in the punishment/reward stage respond in nuanced ways to the observed outcome structure:\n\n- They focus on players whose contributions leave those players with especially high payoffs relative to others because they free-ride on the group effort. When such players end up with high payoffs after contributing little or nothing, the player often responds by imposing heavy punishments, shrinking that payoff advantage. This shows sensitivity to distributive fairness, not just to contribution levels in isolation.\n- They sometimes allow a previously heavily punished defector to earn higher payoffs in rounds where that player improves their contribution, supporting the interpretation that the target is behavior correction, not flat hostility. Concurrent small rewards to that player in high-contribution rounds reinforces this.\n- When the group overall is cooperating strongly, the player often scales back punishment intensity and may not punish at all, or only lightly sanction marginal under-contributors. Their sanctions escalate during periods when group contributions or the average outcome drop due to a few under-contributors, suggesting they track how individual actions affect collective outcomes.\n- They show some willingness to punish moderate under-contributors even when those players are not extreme free-riders, which implies a relatively strict fairness standard: being meaningfully below a de facto norm (rather than only being at zero) can still trigger sanctions. However, the strongest punishments are consistently directed at those whose behavior most clearly undermines group payoffs.\n- They do not visibly reward players who spend heavily on punishment; if they are tracking others’ sanctioning behavior, it does not translate into overt support. Their main signals are tied to contribution and resulting payoffs, not to others’ enforcement choices.\n\nOverall, the player reads the outcome screens as a map of who is helping or hurting the group’s welfare and uses that information to calibrate social control: strong punishment to compress unfairly high free-rider payoffs, reduced or suspended punishment when former defectors contribute more, and occasional rewards to acknowledge and reinforce high-cooperation outcomes. They prioritize enforcing an equitable, high-contribution environment over maximizing their own monetary gain, even when outcome information makes clear that this stance is costly."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a conditional, profit-focused free-rider with intermittent cooperative “bursts.” They treat contribution as a tool rather than a norm. Across the game, they spend a meaningful but minority share of their rounds contributing fully, alternating between full contribution and full defection rather than mixing intermediate amounts (here, a binary choice).\n\nTheir baseline preference is to keep their endowment and live off others’ contributions. When others’ cooperation remains reasonably high without their help, they comfortably defect and accept the group benefit. They do not systematically match others’ behavior: they sometimes contribute fully in environments where free-riding would be clearly more profitable, and sometimes defect in moderately cooperative environments. This suggests they are not following a simple “contribute if enough others do” rule; instead, they appear to explore and periodically test how much cooperation they can induce or sustain, then revert to self-interest.\n\nThey do not display a rigid fairness norm. They are willing to contribute fully even when several peers free-ride, and also willing to free-ride when many peers contribute. This indicates they do not insist on contribution reciprocity before they contribute, nor do they insist on “no one should gain more than me” as a stable rule. Their behavior is better described as opportunistic and adaptive: they are sensitive to the payoff structure and willing to accept payoff inequality if it advantages them.\n\nRisk tolerance appears moderate. They sometimes choose the payoff-dominated cooperative action in environments where cooperation is fragile, which is risky if others defect, yet they never push this to an extreme sustained costly-cooperator pattern. They are not an unconditional cooperator or unconditional defector; instead, they oscillate, suggesting active learning and occasional risk-taking within an overall payoff-oriented frame.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThe player shows awareness of the horizon and gradually shifts toward more consistent free-riding as the game progresses, but does not switch to pure defection. In the final stretch, contributions become rarer and are interspersed with defection even when cooperation by others is still present. The last round itself is played as a free-rider, consistent with standard end-game unraveling logic.\n\nHowever, they do not exhibit a sharp, one-time end-game collapse. Rather, they move in and out of cooperative choices in late rounds, including at least one late cooperative burst despite the short remaining horizon. This suggests they understand that the game is finite and lean more toward self-interest near the end, but they also keep open the possibility of maintaining or exploiting a cooperative environment even late if it seems profitable or strategically interesting.\n\nThere is no clear evidence they are trying to build a reputation for future interactions beyond this game; with punishers being identifiable but no future interaction guaranteed after the final round, they do not make extra cooperative “gestures” at the end. Overall, they show partial end-game decay of cooperation, but not a strict backward-induction style collapse.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThis player is willing to punish and at times punishes quite heavily relative to their own payoff, but only in a subset of cooperative rounds. They never punish when they themselves defect; all observed punishment occurs when they are cooperating. This is consistent with a norm-enforcing or frustration-driven pattern: they are more likely to punish when they perceive themselves as “doing their part” and others not following suit.\n\nTheir punishment is not continuous or automatic. They sometimes cooperate in the presence of clear free-riders and do not punish at all, and at other times, in similarly mixed environments, they invest substantial resources into punishment. This inconsistency suggests that punishment is not governed by a strict threshold rule (e.g., “punish all defectors”); instead, it may be driven by situational emotion, salience of low contributors, or occasional attempts to reset group norms.\n\nPunishment episodes are sizable relative to their own income in those rounds, indicating they are at least temporarily willing to trade off personal payoff to sanction others. Because we do not observe the distribution of their punishment across specific peers, their selectivity toward particular individuals is unknown. However, the fact that they never punish while defecting themselves argues against “pure spite” or random aggression; they appear to reserve costly sanctions for situations in which they see themselves as justified enforcers rather than simultaneous free-riders.\n\nGiven that punishment is identifiable, they must anticipate possible retaliation, yet they still engage in it on multiple occasions. This implies either a taste for norm-enforcement or a belief that the deterrence/teaching effect outweighs the risk of being punished back. Whether their punishment actually changes others’ contributions is unknown.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nThe player is punished multiple times across the game, including in some rounds where they cooperate and some where they defect. Their response to being punished does not show clear compliance or clear retaliation.\n\nThey do not reliably increase contributions after being punished; in some cases, they subsequently defect, and in others they later cooperate again under different conditions. Thus, punishment does not lock them into cooperation. At the same time, they do not exhibit obvious counter-punishment patterns: they never punish in rounds where they are defecting, and they do not increase their use of punishment immediately after receiving deductions in a way that would clearly signal revenge. Because the identity of their punishers is not provided in the transcript, whether they specifically target those individuals is unknown and confidence in any retaliation inference is low.\n\nMore broadly, the player appears relatively thick-skinned regarding punishment. They continue to free-ride in later rounds despite having been sanctioned earlier, indicating they are not easily cowed into permanent cooperative compliance. Nor do they abandon cooperation entirely after being punished while cooperating; they still choose full contribution in later rounds. This suggests a pragmatic stance: punishment is treated as one data point in a noisy environment rather than a binding signal to change strategy.\n\nOverall, their response to punishers mixes partial disregard (they keep defecting when profitable) with occasional cooperative choices that are not tightly coupled to prior sanctions. They neither strongly appease nor systematically retaliate; instead, they maintain their opportunistic, mixed strategy largely independent of who has punished them before."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a conditional, oscillating contributor who mixes full cooperation with full free-riding rather than using intermediate levels. They alternate between contributing everything and nothing, and this pattern persists across the game rather than converging to a stable single mode. They are willing to contribute fully even when the group average is low, suggesting either an experimental or hopeful stance toward cooperation, but they are also comfortable exploiting situations where many others contribute while they do not. Their behavior shows no simple “tit-for-tat” rule; instead, they shift modes repeatedly even when the surrounding contribution pattern looks similar across episodes. They appear sensitive to payoff incentives: when non-contribution yields much higher payoffs, they are willing to free-ride, and when the environment is noisy or low-contributing, they sometimes still invest fully, perhaps to test whether cooperation can be sustained or to hedge between moral and monetary motives. Fairness norms are mixed: they sometimes act like a high contributor in a low-contributing group (accepting disadvantage), and at other times they act like a pure free-rider in a high-contributing environment (accepting advantage), so any stable equity preference is unknown. Risk tolerance is moderate to high: they repeatedly choose the dominated cooperative action in an environment where others often contribute little, but they also repeatedly take the safe selfish option when that is clearly profitable.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThere is no clear last-round “grab everything” pivot, because they already alternate between full giving and full keeping earlier in the game. They continue to use the same binary pattern of full contribution or none in the final phase, with no obvious monotonic decay of cooperation. They remain willing to fully cooperate in late rounds even after experiencing punishment as a free-rider, and they also still free-ride in some late rounds, so horizon effects on their behavior are muted or masked by their pre-existing oscillation. They seem aware of the game length (by design), but there is no sharp strategic shift tied to the approaching end; instead, they keep experimenting with both cooperative and selfish actions until the very last round. Their forward-looking reasoning style and beliefs about end-game unraveling are therefore unknown or at best low-confidence: behavior is consistent with a player who either does not fully apply backward induction or chooses to ignore it.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey never use the punishment mechanism at any point, despite repeated exposure to low contributors and despite themselves being punished multiple times. They thus appear highly reluctant to spend resources on sanctioning, whether for deterrence, norm enforcement, or retaliation. This is not due to lack of opportunity: they encounter clear defections and also face situations where others punish them, yet still refrain from punishing. This suggests either that they view punishment as too costly, ineffective, or not worth the effort, or that they place little value on enforcing cooperative norms relative to preserving their own payoff. Their motives—whether purely self-interested cost avoidance, aversion to hurting others, or skepticism about punishment’s effectiveness—are unknown, but their revealed strategy is consistent: ignore the sanctioning tool and adjust only their own contribution decisions.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nWhen punished, they do not retaliate; they consistently continue to spend nothing on punishment after being targeted. Their later actions mix cooperation and free-riding, so it is unclear whether they interpret punishment as a normative signal or merely as noise. Sometimes after being punished as a free-rider they later choose to contribute fully; at other times they resume or maintain free-riding, so there is no clear compliance pattern strictly tied to sanctions. They also never appear to single out any identifiable punisher for counter-punishment (or any punishment at all), indicating a non-confrontational stance and a high degree of forgiveness or indifference toward being sanctioned. Whether this reflects genuine tolerance, strategic avoidance of costly feuds, or simple inertia is unknown, but their type is best characterized as “non-retaliatory and sanction-insensitive.”"

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a stable, unconditional high contributor. They always contribute their full endowment, never deviating even when others free ride or partially defect. Their cooperation does not appear contingent on others’ behavior: they continue to contribute fully when some players give nothing, and also when everyone cooperates. They show no visible attempt to fine-tune contributions in response to individual defectors, instead treating contribution as a fixed norm. This suggests a strong intrinsic or norm-based preference for full cooperation rather than payoff-maximizing calculus. Risk tolerance appears high regarding potential exploitation: they persist with full contributions despite repeated evidence that at least one player is free riding and sometimes being rewarded overall. Fairness norms are present but are not expressed through adjusting their own contribution level; instead, fairness concerns show up in their initial punishment choice (see below) rather than in withholding contributions.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThe player never sends any chat messages. They neither initiate coordination nor respond verbally to others’ attempts at persuasion, humor, or social bonding. They are completely silent despite an active, social, and sometimes playful group chat environment. This is consistent with a highly task-focused or low-engagement communication style. They may be strategically “quiet cooperative”: participating through actions only, letting contribution and sanctioning speak for itself. There is no evidence of explicit norm signaling, emotional expression, or alliance-building through chat. Their non-participation in jokes and meta-discussion suggests either disinterest, deliberate neutrality, or a preference to avoid social influence or conflict in communication channels. Overall, they are behaviorally engaged but socially silent.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThe player’s cooperative strategy shows no end-game decay. They maintain full contributions through the final rounds, even when it is common-knowledge that the game is about to end. They do not appear to shift into selfish extraction near the end, and they also do not suddenly intensify use of punishment or reward as the horizon approaches. Their pattern of not using sanctions after the first period continues unchanged into the last period. This indicates that their cooperation is not driven primarily by long-term reciprocity or future-oriented incentives; instead, they behave as if full contribution is the appropriate action regardless of remaining rounds. Awareness of the horizon is given in the interface, but there is no behavioral sign that they strategically respond to it.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey punish only once and very heavily, targeting a player who contributed fully but was already being massively punished by others. They spend a substantial amount of their own payoff to further increase that player’s deductions. After this, they never punish again, even though several players later contribute nothing in multiple rounds. This single, early, high-intensity punishment is not obviously efficiency-oriented: the target is not a low contributor in that round, and the marginal deterrent value of further punishment is arguably low given the already extreme level imposed by others. The behavior fits a “bandwagon” or “pile-on” pattern: joining a collective punishment episode rather than independently evaluating contribution behavior that round. There is no evidence of targeted, proportional sanctioning tied strictly to current free riding; instead, the one observed punishment is extreme, socially aligned with others’ hostility to the same player, and then discontinued entirely. After this event, they seem to refrain from all further punitive action, even when future behavior (e.g., zero contributions by several players) would provide clear justifications under standard conditional-cooperation norms. Their punishment style is thus: highly willing to spend a lot in an initial social-punishment cascade, but not systematically enforcing norms thereafter. Motivation is ambiguous; it could be driven by early affect/identity cues from chat (others labeling someone negatively) rather than strictly by current contribution levels. Confidence on the exact motive is low.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nThey are never punished in the transcript. Consequently, their response to being punished is unknown. There is no evidence on whether they would retaliate, comply by changing contributions, or ignore sanctions if they occurred.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey never allocate rewards to anyone, despite many players contributing fully and some others using reward as positive reinforcement. They forgo low-cost opportunities to strengthen cooperation or reciprocate kindness through the reward channel, even when they themselves receive rewards. This consistent non-use of rewards suggests they either do not value the reward mechanism, prefer to conserve coins once the initial punishment burst is over, or treat contributions as self-sufficient signals that do not require extra reinforcement. There is no selective rewarding of high contributors, no alliance-like reward patterns, and no final-round “thank you” rewarding. The absence of any reward behavior contrasts with their early willingness to spend heavily on punishment, pointing toward a sanctioning style that is skewed (when active) toward negative rather than positive incentives.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThey receive small rewards in at least some rounds from several others, but they never reciprocate via rewards. They also do not shift their sanction behavior in favor of those who rewarded them, nor do they start rewarding cooperators more generally. Their contribution behavior remains unchanged (always full), and their punishment/reward behavior remains minimal after the first round. This indicates that they do not use the reward channel for reciprocity or alliance building, at least within the observed game. Their response to being rewarded is essentially behavioral inertia: they keep cooperating but do not “pay back” through the same mechanism. Whether they feel gratitude privately is unknown; observable reciprocity in rewards is absent.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey see detailed information about others’ payoffs, punishment, and reward flows. Their one major behavioral response to others’ outcomes is joining an early, extreme collective punishment episode against a single player who ends with a large negative payoff due to group sanctions. They contribute to that outcome by adding significant punishment of their own. After that, they do not visibly react to later variations in others’ outcomes: they do not step in to punish later free riders or to support cooperators with rewards, even when others clearly spend on such actions. They also do not alter their own contributions in response to any pattern of outcomes; they keep contributing fully regardless of who is being rewarded or punished and how payoffs are distributed. This suggests that they attend to others’ outcomes enough to join a salient early punishment cascade but then settle into a “cooperate and ignore” stance where payoff heterogeneity and sanction patterns no longer drive their behavior. Their sensitivity to social information seems front-loaded and not dynamically updated across later rounds, or at least does not manifest in further strategic changes.\n\n"

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a stable, unconditional high contributor. They always contribute the full endowment, never deviating even when some others contribute nothing or when free-riding is repeatedly visible. Their behavior aligns with a strong efficiency and cooperation norm: they appear to prioritize maximizing the group return over exploiting others. They show no evidence of conditional cooperation (they do not scale contributions down in response to defectors, nor up relative to others); instead they follow a simple “always all-in” rule. They seem comfortable bearing the risk of being exploited by low contributors and do not attempt to hedge against defection. Fairness concerns, if present, do not translate into adjusting contributions; they rely on other mechanisms (chiefly social norms and possibly punishment by others) to handle unfairness rather than altering their own cooperative stance.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nTheir communication is sparse, light, and affiliative rather than strategic. They greet others implicitly by joining in with the group’s “all in” norm and later explicitly endorse that norm with a brief statement supporting full contributions every time. They also participate in the playful “we are robots” banter with a humorous remark, signaling sociability and a desire to fit into the group mood rather than to lead or criticize. They do not directly confront low contributors or direct others to punish or reward; instead they echo the cooperative consensus that has already formed. They do not initiate substantive coordination about punishment or rewards, and they avoid moralistic or aggressive language. Overall, they engage enough to be seen as part of the cooperative in-group, but they do not attempt to shape group strategy in a forceful or detailed way.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThey show no end-game decay in cooperation. Their contribution level remains at the maximum right through the final round, even as the horizon becomes short and others continue to free-ride intermittently. They do not switch to opportunistic behavior despite having no future rounds in which to rebuild reputation or benefit from reciprocity. There is no evidence that they try to exploit last-round anonymity or to recoup earlier losses. This suggests either a rule-based or principled commitment to cooperation that is insensitive to the finite horizon, or at least a choice not to condition on it in practice. Their use of punishment and rewards does not intensify or strategically change at the end; after an early punishment they remain inactive in the sanctioning stage through the remainder of the game, including in the final round.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey punish exactly once, targeting a player who contributes fully in that period and has not clearly deviated in that round. The amount is minimal in the context of the game and is extremely small relative to the much larger punishment this target receives from others. The trigger for this punishment is ambiguous: it does not clearly correspond to immediate free-riding or to a contemporaneous breach of a cooperation norm. This makes the motive uncertain: it could be a mistaken click, a playful or bandwagon response to emerging hostility toward that player, or a weak expression of disapproval for prior noncooperative behavior. After this single act, they refrain from using punishment altogether, even when standard free-riding targets reappear and other players continue to punish them. They never engage in retaliatory punishment; they themselves are never punished, so their tolerance for personal provocation is unknown. Overall, they are best described as a very low-intensity, non-escalating punisher whose willingness to spend on punishment is limited and not clearly strategic.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nThey are never punished by any other player in the observed game, so their direct response to being punished is unknown. There is no evidence of preemptive appeasement or of retaliatory tendencies because they do not face any deductions. Their steady high contributions and non-use of late punishment suggest they are not trying to signal toughness or a readiness to retaliate, but this is inference with low confidence because no direct provocation occurs.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey never spend any resources on rewards. Even when others cooperate fully and some players reward them or other cooperators, they provide no positive reinforcement through the costly reward mechanism. This could reflect a preference to conserve payoff, skepticism about the efficacy of rewards, cognitive load/neglect of the reward option, or a belief that cooperation should be its own norm without needing side payments. Given that their contributions remain maximally cooperative, their lack of rewarding is not driven by selfish exploitation of others’ efforts, but rather by an apparent choice to rely on contribution behavior (and possibly group punishment) as the main cooperative device rather than spending additional coins on positive incentives.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThey receive a small reward from another player once. After that, they do not reciprocate with rewards to that player or to anyone else in subsequent rounds, nor do they change their contribution pattern (which was already fully cooperative). Their polite and humorous chat style suggests they are not hostile to the rewarder, but behaviorally they show no observable payoff-based reciprocity in the reward stage. They also do not publicly acknowledge or comment on having been rewarded, so any private feeling of gratitude is unobserved. In terms of observable strategy, they treat being rewarded as non-diagnostic: it does not alter their sanctioning decisions or their cooperative rule.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey appear relatively indifferent, behaviorally, to the detailed payoff and punishment/reward distributions of others. They see several cycles where specific low contributors are heavily punished by many players, and where some cooperators reward each other, yet they almost never join in sanctioning and never adjust their own contribution level. They do not speak up in chat to endorse or condemn the severity of punishment or the generosity of rewards, focusing instead on general cooperation slogans and light banter. They show no sign of targeting high earners, low earners, or heavy punishers/rewarders with any systematic pattern. The one early punishment they impose does not clearly track contemporaneous deviations, and they do not follow up on that target later even when that player’s outcomes remain salient. Overall, they attend enough to know that “all in” is good for the group and to participate in group identity talk, but they do not appear to engage in fine-grained tracking or management of others’ outcomes."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player fits a “strategic free-rider with intermittent reciprocity” type. They understand that the group return on contributions is high, and they are clearly *willing* to contribute fully, but only in selected moments and not as a stable norm.\n\nTheir contributions are highly volatile rather than consistent. They alternate between:\n- full contributions,\n- complete free-riding,\n- and occasional intermediate amounts.\n\nThey reliably contribute more when there is a current or recent norm of high contributions from others, and they frequently drop to zero when others are also contributing substantially. This pattern suggests conditional cooperation in *timing* (joining or sustaining cooperative phases) mixed with opportunistic exploitation once a cooperative environment is in place.\n\nThey do not display a simple “tit-for-tat” response to any single individual; instead, their behavior appears keyed to the *overall* contribution climate. They sometimes rejoin high cooperation even after having just exploited others, indicating they value group efficiency or fairness at least intermittently, but they are willing to accept being the main beneficiary of the public good when they see that others continue to contribute.\n\nThere is no evidence they are strongly fairness-driven in a strict, consistent sense; they tolerate repeatedly earning more than cooperative peers. At the same time, they are not a pure low-contributor type: they repeatedly take on personally costly, high contributions even when free-riding is available. This points to mixed motives: some concern for group welfare or norm-following, combined with strong payoff-seeking.\n\nRisk tolerance appears moderate: they are willing to be the high contributor even when some group members are clearly free-riding, which risks ending up exploited, but they also periodically hedge by keeping all their own endowment. The pattern looks more like strategic cycling than random noise.\n\nOverall, they are best modeled as a sophisticated conditional cooperator who opportunistically times free-riding rather than adhering to a principled cooperative rule.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nTheir communication is sparse, direct, and cooperative at the outset. They immediately endorse a full-contribution plan proposed by another player and do so without hedging or negotiation. This shows readiness to coordinate around an efficient, pro-social norm when prompted by others, but they do not take a leadership role in proposing norms themselves.\n\nAfter that brief agreement, they remain silent for the rest of the game. They do not defend, justify, or explain their later free-riding, nor do they confront others about low contributions. This suggests a low-engagement or low-disclosure style: they prefer to adapt silently rather than manage social impressions or argue about fairness.\n\nThey are clearly reading the chat (since they respond once early), but there is no evidence they try to persuade, shame, or rally people in later phases. Socially, they come across as understated and pragmatic rather than expressive. Their willingness to initially endorse “everyone contributes everything” alongside later quiet free-riding indicates they do not strongly internalize the social commitments expressed in chat, or they are comfortable deviating without explanation once conditions change.\n\nIn terms of tone, their single message is neutral and cooperative. There is no observable hostility, sarcasm, or moralizing; beyond the initial assent to a cooperative norm, their communication gives little signal about their personality or emotional state. Motivation and reasoning must be inferred primarily from their contribution behavior rather than their words.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThey show awareness of the finite horizon in a behavioral sense: near the end, they do not shift into a pure “endgame free-ride everything” strategy. Instead, they continue to use mixed contributions, including both low and high amounts, right up to the final decision.\n\nIn the closing phase, they at times free-ride while many others contribute heavily, and at other times they themselves contribute fully when others also do so. This indicates that their behavior is not driven solely by backwards induction logic or simple endgame unraveling. They do not display a clear monotonic decay of cooperation toward the end; if anything, they sustain or even revive high contributions in the last decision.\n\nThis pattern suggests:\n- They may not be strategically optimizing specifically for the very last round.\n- They may still care about maintaining or re-establishing a cooperative environment even when no future interaction is left.\n- Alternatively, they may simply be following the same conditional/mixed rule throughout, without giving special weight to the horizon.\n\nBecause they do not comment on the number of rounds or on upcoming termination, their explicit beliefs about the end-game are unknown. Behaviorally, though, they are not a classic “end-game defector”: they continue to cooperate substantially in the final decisions despite knowing the game is about to end.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey appear to closely observe others’ contributions and resulting payoffs, but they never verbalize any reaction to individual outcomes. They neither praise high contributors nor complain about free-riders. There is no direct social sanctioning or reward through words, and no mechanism exists in this game for monetary punishment or reward, so all their responses must be inferred from their own subsequent contribution choices.\n\nBehaviorally, they are comfortable allowing others to earn less while they profit from free-riding. When many others contribute high amounts and accept lower private payoffs, they do not move immediately to “correct” this inequality; instead, they often maintain or adopt zero contributions and enjoy the payoff advantage. This tolerance for asymmetric outcomes suggests that envy or guilt, if present, are not strong enough to override their opportunistic play.\n\nHowever, they also sometimes take on the role of high contributor when others are also investing heavily, even though they have previously seen that such generosity can lead to them earning less than free-riders. This indicates that they are not purely outcome-maximizing in a myopic sense; they are willing to join the cooperative set even after having observed its vulnerability to exploitation. They may believe that re-creating or sustaining a high-contribution environment is still worthwhile for overall group returns, or they may place some intrinsic value on “doing their part” under the right conditions.\n\nThere is no sign that they adjust contributions in a targeted way in response to any particular player’s payoff; their responses track the *aggregate* pattern of contributions and payoffs rather than focusing on specific individuals. Emotional reactions such as resentment, sympathy, or moral approval are not expressed in chat, so their inner attitudes toward others’ outcomes remain unknown. The safest inference is that they primarily treat others’ outcomes as information about how cooperative the environment is and whether it is currently profitable or safe for them to either contribute or free-ride."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a flexible, opportunistic contributor who frequently alternates between full contribution and full free-riding. They do not lock into a stable pattern: they sometimes join high-contribution environments and sometimes defect even when others contribute heavily. Their decisions are not purely selfish; they occasionally contribute when many others defect and also defect when others cooperate, suggesting that matching or fairness is not their primary rule. Instead, they appear to treat contribution as one tool among several for influencing group dynamics, not as a moral commitment.\n\nThey show no simple conditional rule like “I contribute if most others do” or “I contribute if I was punished.” They contribute in both cooperative and defect-heavy contexts, and they also free-ride in both. This indicates low adherence to a straightforward fairness norm such as strict conditional cooperation. Risk tolerance for social sanctions is moderate: they continue to alternate between contributing and defecting even when they are repeatedly punished, implying they accept or discount the risk of further sanctions rather than strictly complying.\n\nOverall, their contribution behavior fits an “experimenting enforcer” type: they treat their own contribution as secondary to their influence via punishment and reward, and they are willing to bear being seen as a defector at times.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nAwareness of the finite horizon does not lead to a simple end-game collapse or pure exploitation. In the final segment of the game they still mix contributions and defections and continue to use both costly punishment and reward, including in the very last round. They do not switch to purely selfish play or stop investing in social control when no future rounds remain, indicating that immediate material payoff is not their sole driver.\n\nThere is no visible trend toward systematically increasing or decreasing cooperation as the end approaches; instead, their pattern of alternating between contribution and free-riding persists. The continued willingness to spend on sanctions in the final rounds suggests they value expressing norms or “finishing the game right” over maximizing final-round income. This points to a stable preference for norm enforcement and signaling, rather than a strategy tightly optimized to the horizon.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThis player is a very heavy and frequent user of punishment. They impose sanctions in most rounds where the mechanism is available and often spend substantial amounts to do so. Their punishment is not narrowly focused on classic free-riders; they sometimes punish high contributors and sometimes punish defectors, and they target both frequent cooperators and frequent low contributors. This indicates that their criteria for punishment go beyond simple “punish non-contributors.”\n\nTheir targeting suggests several intertwined motives:\n\n- **Norm enforcement with a personal twist:** They regularly punish clear non-contributors who benefit from others’ cooperation, which is consistent with enforcing a contribution norm. At the same time, they also punish some cooperators and some players who appear neutral, which implies their norm is idiosyncratic, possibly based on a richer mental record of who has been “good” or “bad” earlier, including past punishment or reward decisions.\n\n- **Retaliation and score-settling:** They are themselves punished by multiple others, yet they persist in sanctioning those same players or their perceived allies. Because punishers are identifiable, the repetition of punishment against certain names, including some who have already been punished heavily by others, points to retaliatory or vindictive elements rather than purely forward-looking deterrence.\n\n- **Willingness to bear large costs:** They repeatedly spend on punishment even when it significantly reduces their own payoff in that round, and they do not stop doing so after experiencing large deductions from others. This shows a strong willingness to incur personal cost to impose harm, consistent with strong negative reciprocity and/or spite toward perceived norm violators.\n\nSelectivity is present but loose: they do not punish everyone, and they frequently pick out specific subsets of players each round. The pattern suggests they track reputations and use punishment both as a tool to express disapproval and as a way to “balance accounts,” rather than following a simple mechanical rule based only on current-round contributions.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nWhen punished, this player does not show clear compliance by aligning their behavior with punishers’ apparent preferences. Instead, they continue to alternate between contribution and free-riding and to use heavy punishment themselves. There is no consistent move toward safer, more conformist behavior after being targeted. This indicates low responsiveness to punishment as a deterrent and low deference to others’ attempts at control.\n\nThey also do not clearly stop punishing those who punish them; some of their punishment choices are consistent with retaliating against players who had previously imposed costs on them, but the mapping is not one-to-one and cannot be asserted with high confidence. Overall, however, their persistent and sometimes escalating sanctioning despite being hit themselves suggests they are not easily cowed and may even regard being punished as part of a conflict they are willing to continue.\n\nForgiveness versus grudges remains ambiguous. Because they both punish and reward many of the same players across time, it is unclear whether they actively forgive past punishers or simply follow a complex internal ledger that sometimes results in positive and sometimes in negative actions toward the same counterpart. Confidence in attributing a stable forgiving or unforgiving stance is low; the safest description is that they are not punishment-averse and do not visibly “back down” in response to being sanctioned.\n\n<REWARD>\nThis player is also a frequent and substantial user of reward, although less single-mindedly than punishment. They spend notable amounts to reward others across many rounds. Their rewards are directed both to high contributors and to some low contributors, and sometimes to players who are themselves frequent punishers or rewarders. This shows that their rewards are not purely based on current-round contribution levels.\n\nThe pattern suggests multiple motives:\n\n- **Positive reinforcement of perceived allies or behaviors:** They often reward players who appear cooperative or who may have treated them well (e.g., by rewarding them or refraining from punishing them). This points to conditional kindness: they use rewards to encourage or maintain alliances and to reinforce behaviors they like.\n\n- **Balancing and signaling:** They sometimes reward players who are simultaneously being heavily punished by others, and they occasionally reward players they themselves have punished in other rounds. This indicates that they use reward to fine-tune their stance toward individuals, signaling nuance (“I disapprove of some things, but I still credit you for others”) rather than treating punishment and reward as mutually exclusive.\n\n- **Low efficiency concern:** Given that here reward has much weaker leverage than punishment, a payoff-maximizer would use punishment for deterrence and rarely reward. This player nevertheless invests substantially in rewards, suggesting that they are motivated by expressive or relational concerns (gratitude, alliance-building, or fairness adjustments) more than by strict cost-benefit efficiency.\n\nOverall, their reward behavior is generous but strategic: they seem to maintain a mental map of who is “on their side” or promoting the kind of group they prefer and use rewards to support those players, even when the mechanism is relatively weak.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nWhen rewarded, this player does not exhibit a simple, consistent reciprocity rule, but there are hints of gratitude or alliance-building. They often reward players who themselves are active in the reward system, and they include frequent rewarders among their positive targets in later decisions. However, the evidence is not strong enough to claim a strict “I reward those who reward me” strategy; many of their reward and punishment choices do not map cleanly onto who has helped or hurt them most recently.\n\nThey do not clearly shift their contribution behavior upward in response to being rewarded, nor do they consistently protect rewarders from future punishment. This suggests that, while they may feel and express some gratitude, their internal ledger blends many factors (contribution history, punishment history, others’ treatment by the group) rather than simple direct reciprocity. Their response to being rewarded is therefore best described as partially reciprocal and relational, but noisy: they are open to alliances, yet they do not subordinate their broader norm-enforcement agenda to any one relationship.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThis player appears highly attentive to others’ contributions, payoffs, and sanctioning patterns. They adjust their punishment and reward targets in ways that reflect an active reading of who is currently being hurt, who is benefiting, and who is spending on sanctions. They sometimes support players who are otherwise being heavily punished by others, and they sometimes pile additional punishment onto players already under group pressure. This indicates that they track not only raw contributions but also social standing and recent treatment.\n\nThey often reward players whose outcomes suggest cooperation or costly generosity and punish those whose outcomes suggest repeated free-riding or aggressive sanctioning. However, because they sometimes sanction cooperators and reward low contributors, they are evidently using a more complex evaluation than “cooperation good, defection bad.” They may weigh perceived fairness across multiple rounds, viewing certain highly successful players as deserving of correction if their success is seen as coming at the group’s expense or through overuse of punishment.\n\nOverall, their reaction to others’ outcomes is that of an active, opinionated social accountant: they use the detailed feedback on contributions, sanctions, and payoffs to maintain a mental reputation system and to continually adjust who they punish or reward. They accept substantial personal cost to act on these judgments, prioritizing the expression and enforcement of their idiosyncratic norms over maximizing their own monetary outcome."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a high, near-unconditional cooperator. They almost always contribute the full endowment despite many free riders being present and despite frequent personal punishment. Defection is extremely rare and appears only in two isolated rounds, not as part of a trend. Their cooperation is only weakly conditional on others’ behavior: they continue to contribute when low contributors and zero contributors persist in the group, and when they themselves are targeted. They seem to follow a strong norm that “one should cooperate with the group” even when it is not payoff-maximizing. They tolerate substantial exploitation and do not attempt to protect themselves by systematically reducing contributions when others free ride. This pattern suggests a fairness or efficiency norm that prioritizes the public good over short-run personal gain, combined with high risk tolerance regarding being the “sucker” who contributes when others do not. They do not appear to be experimenting with contributions; their behavior is stable and rule-like rather than exploratory.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThe player remains cooperative through the final round. There is no clear contribution decay as the horizon approaches; instead, they continue to provide full contributions even when many others visibly defect late in the game and when they receive strong end-game punishment for defecting once. Their rare defections do not cluster strictly at the end; the last round returns to full cooperation. On the sanctioning side, they continue to use punishment and reward mechanisms late into the game, including targeted punishment in the final round, indicating they remain engaged in norm enforcement rather than “cashing out” or ceasing to invest in costly social control. This suggests they either discount the end-game structure or deliberately ignore backward-induction logic in favor of maintaining norms until the very end.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThe player is a frequent and targeted punisher. They consistently punish a persistent low contributor (PINGUIN) across many rounds, even when that player is heavily punished by others, indicating a strong anti-free-rider stance rather than a one-off reaction. They also punish another low-contributing player (CROCODILE) on selected occasions, particularly when that player combines low contributions with complex punishment/reward behavior toward others. Their punishment of high free riders is more systematic than their punishment of medium contributors; they do not punish cooperators, and they almost never punish ambiguous or borderline cases. This selectivity points to norm-enforcement and deterrence motives: they target those who repeatedly contribute nothing while benefiting from the group. They are willing to absorb sizable personal costs to continue this punishment stream, showing low sensitivity to the personal cost effectiveness of punishment and high commitment to enforcing a cooperative standard. In one notable exception, they punish a previously cooperative player (SLOTH) in the final round after that player has been zero-contributing intermittently and also engaging in heavy sanctioning. This end-game punishment appears consistent with punishing defectors rather than random retaliation: they do not appear to use punishment against those who punished them, and there is no clear pattern of counter-punishment toward their own punishers. Overall, they use punishment as a consistent, morally driven tool against chronic free riders, not as an emotional response to being targeted.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nThey are repeatedly punished by several others, including for both cooperative and defective rounds, and sometimes quite harshly. Their behavioral response is strikingly non-retaliatory: they never clearly punish someone simply because that party punished them earlier, and they do not switch to targeting those who sanction them. Instead, they keep punishing the same norm-violating free riders and keep cooperating in contributions. There is no strong evidence that punishment toward them causes sustained contribution reductions; they defect once after having been a persistent cooperator, are heavily punished, and then return to high contributions. When they are punished in rounds where they cooperate, they neither respond with counter-punishment nor with social withdrawal (e.g., serial defection). This indicates high forgiveness or at least a strong separation in their mind between “who punished me” and “who is violating the contribution norm.” They appear to interpret punishment directed at themselves as part of the general noisy sanctioning environment rather than as a signal to change targets or form vendettas. Compliance-wise, they do not clearly adjust their target selection in favor of their punishers or away from them; they stay focused on chronic low contributors.\n\n<REWARD>\nThe player is a regular and selective rewarder, but much less intense in rewarding than in punishing. They spend on rewards for clear high contributors and for especially prosocial players, often reinforcing those who repeatedly contribute fully and sometimes also engage in prosocial sanctioning. Reward targets include consistently cooperative players and those who have rewarded or supported cooperation in others, indicating a mix of gratitude and reinforcement motives. They almost never reward low contributors, and when a previous free rider begins contributing or stops misbehaving, the player sometimes withholds further punishment but does not immediately move into rewarding them; their rewards are more clearly tied to ongoing, visible cooperation than to one-off improvements. They accept the poor cost-effectiveness of the reward technology and still use it, suggesting a preference for norm reinforcement and positive signaling over simple earnings maximization. Over time, they refine reward targets somewhat, tending to reward a small subset of the most dependable cooperators rather than distributing rewards widely.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThey receive rewards in various rounds from multiple others, yet their reward behavior does not obviously track who has previously rewarded them. They do not build explicit bilateral “alliances” of mutual rewarding; instead, they reward based on perceived overall contribution and cooperativeness. There is no clear tit-for-tat reciprocation of reward to any specific individual that can be tied to a prior incoming reward from that same individual. This suggests that gratitude, while possibly present, is filtered through their underlying norm-based criteria: they appear to value sustained cooperative conduct more than personal kindness toward themselves. Being rewarded does not shift their punishment targets away from free riders nor does it induce them to preferentially protect or defend their rewarders; their sanctioning decisions remain focused on contribution behavior. Overall, their response to being rewarded is to maintain their cooperative and norm-enforcing strategy rather than to shift into alliance-based reciprocity.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey pay close attention to who is contributing and who is not, and they appear to track how others use the punishment and reward mechanisms. Their persistent focus on the same chronic free rider shows that they extrapolate from repeated low contributions to a stable “type” and act accordingly. They seem unperturbed by others’ high payoffs when those payoffs come from cooperation; they even reinforce such players with rewards. Conversely, when free riders maintain relatively high payoffs despite frequent punishment, the player continues to sanction them rather than disengaging, suggesting they are monitoring outcomes and concluding that more enforcement is warranted. They do not appear jealous of high-earning cooperators; instead, they treat them as partners in maintaining a cooperative environment. When observing complex sanctioning by others (for example, other players heavily punishing multiple targets), they do not automatically join those sanctioning campaigns; their response remains anchored in observed contribution patterns rather than in how much someone is spending on punishment or reward. In late game, when others escalate punishment intensity and some players incur severe losses through sanctioning, this player does not mirror that escalation; they keep costs moderate and targets stable. This restraint supports a personality profile of a principled norm enforcer who is attentive to patterns in others’ behavior but resists being drawn into cycles of escalating hostility."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a primarily cooperative, mildly opportunistic contributor who generally follows the group norm of full contribution but occasionally free-rides when it seems unlikely to be noticed or sanctioned.\n\nThey overwhelmingly choose the maximal contribution option and maintain this across most of the game, even when others sometimes deviate. This suggests they accept the cooperative norm and are comfortable giving up the private endowment when they expect the group to do the same. Their contributions do not collapse over time; they repeatedly return to full contribution after deviations by others, so they do not display strong conditional cooperation in the sense of punishing defectors by systematically lowering their own contributions.\n\nAt a few points they contribute nothing despite high or near-unanimous contributions from others. These choices are infrequent and not followed by any explanation in chat, but they coincide with periods when overall cooperation is already strong and when the player is not being singled out in discussion. This pattern is consistent with occasional strategic free-riding: taking advantage of others’ contributions once a high-cooperation norm is established, while relying on the fact that no explicit sanction or tracking mechanism exists.\n\nThey do not verbally advocate for any contribution rule, do not try to enforce fairness norms, and do not publicly criticize low contributors. Their behavior suggests they internally value the higher payoffs from mutual cooperation but are also attentive to personal payoff maximization and willing to defect quietly when the social or reputational cost appears low. Risk tolerance appears moderate: they are willing to continue contributing even when some others defect, implying they are not highly loss-averse about “wasted” contributions, yet they also hedge with a few free-riding moves rather than naively contributing every time.\n\nOverall, their strategy is: “Contribute fully by default to preserve the cooperative environment and enjoy large group returns, but occasionally exploit the public good in a low-visibility way for extra personal gain,” without openly challenging or reinforcing norms in communication.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThis player’s communication is minimal, polite, and socially oriented rather than strategic. They offer a brief greeting at the start, explicitly state that they are a human participant when prompted, and later answer a casual, off-topic question about having eaten. They do not initiate discussions about strategy, incentives, or fairness, nor do they join others in trying to coordinate on contribution rules.\n\nThey never pressure others to contribute, never complain about low contributors, and never praise or thank high contributors. This indicates an avoidance of leadership or enforcement roles and a preference for blending into the group. They respond when directly or implicitly invited into simple social exchanges but otherwise remain quiet, suggesting a low-visibility, low-conflict engagement style.\n\nTheir tone is neutral to friendly, with no sarcasm, insults, or strong emotional expression. They show no evidence of trying to manipulate others’ beliefs about the game or the payoff structure, and they refrain from participating in the more intense norm-enforcement or joking that others engage in. Communication appears to serve identity confirmation and light social presence rather than coordination or persuasion.\n\nIn sum, they engage enough to appear cooperative and “present,” but they strategically stay out of any debates or norm-setting conversations, keeping a low profile that matches their mostly cooperative but occasionally opportunistic contribution behavior."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThe player is a strongly cooperative high contributor who typically gives the maximum possible amount. Their default is to contribute fully to the public fund, with only a few modest deviations where they retain a small portion. Contribution levels are very stable across the game, showing a clear internal norm of “I should cooperate,” rather than opportunistic switching.\n\nThey do sometimes shave off a few coins while the rest of the group is mixed between high and low contributions, indicating they are not an unconditional altruist: they are willing to take slightly more for themselves when the environment looks less cooperative. However, these adjustments are small relative to what standard self-interest would suggest, especially given the marginal per-coin return is well below one (the environment is socially efficient to contribute but individually costly). This pattern points to a fairness- or norm-driven cooperator who prioritizes group welfare and consistency over immediate material payoff.\n\nThey appear tolerant of free-riding and do not heavily condition their behavior on others’ short-run defection. Even when others give much less and earn more, they maintain high contributions rather than withdrawing cooperation. This suggests a “principled cooperator” type who values sticking to a cooperative standard even when exploited, with moderate but not extreme sensitivity to group behavior.\n\nRisk tolerance is high in the social sense: they repeatedly expose themselves to being exploited by low contributors in order to sustain public-good production. They do not experiment broadly with contribution levels or attempt profit-maximizing deviations; instead, they keep a simple, pro-social rule and follow it.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThe player does not speak in the observable chat at all, despite multiple conversational threads and coordination attempts by others. Their communication style is therefore silent and nonverbal; they “speak” only through their contributions. They neither propose strategies nor respond explicitly to calls for cooperation, jokes, or blame assignment.\n\nBy not joining discussions about who is cooperative or selfish, they avoid direct conflict and reputational negotiation. This non-engagement can indicate shyness, preference for low social involvement, or a deliberate choice to stay out of social dynamics and let actions convey intent. It also means they do not try to persuade others or sanction them verbally; they appear to accept the group state as given rather than trying to manage it.\n\nOverall, their social style is passive and cooperative: they contribute in a way that supports group welfare but do not try to coordinate norms or call out defectors.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThe player shows no classic “end-game defection” pattern. As the game approaches its final rounds, they continue to contribute at or near their previous high levels, including in the very last round. There is no evidence that they exploit knowledge of the horizon to grab a final-round windfall.\n\nTheir mild mid- and late-game deviations from full contribution do not escalate toward the end; instead, they end on a fully cooperative note, even when others are not uniformly doing so. This suggests that they either do not place much weight on backward induction or consciously reject the logic of “last-round selfishness” in favor of consistency with their cooperative norm.\n\nThey therefore fit an “end-game stable cooperator” profile: they maintain their cooperative identity and behavior regardless of remaining rounds, rather than strategically unwinding cooperation as the horizon approaches.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThe player repeatedly observes situations where less cooperative players earn higher payoffs than they do, yet they do not visibly retaliate or reduce contributions sharply in response. When others’ free-riding is especially prominent, they sometimes slightly reduce their own contribution but remain strongly pro-social. There is no shift toward full self-interest despite clear evidence that defectors are better off in many periods.\n\nThey do not comment in chat about unfairness, selfishness, or “wolves,” even when others openly discuss these themes. This suggests emotional restraint at least at the level of observable behavior: they may notice the payoff asymmetries, but they do not turn that into visible indignation, blame, or norm-enforcement attempts.\n\nOverall, the player appears tolerant of being exploited in payoff terms and does not condition harshly on others’ outcomes. They update only marginally—adjusting contributions slightly when the environment looks more selfish—but their core cooperative rule remains in place, even after clear evidence that others can and do profit from lower contributions."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player fits a “robust high contributor” type with mild conditional adjustment. They strongly favor cooperation over individual profit, repeatedly choosing contributions near or at the maximum even when the return from the public fund is lower than the private return. Their giving pattern is generally stable and high rather than erratic. After seeing clear evidence of others free-riding, they slightly lower their contribution once but quickly revert to full cooperation, suggesting that fairness concerns and efficiency motives exist but are overridden by a strong internal norm to contribute. They appear willing to incur substantial personal payoff losses relative to free-riders, indicating low aversion to being exploited and relatively low risk aversion about ending up with a below-average payoff. Their strategy suggests a preference for the socially efficient outcome and internalized cooperation norms over strict payoff maximization.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThe player shows no classic “end-game defection” pattern. Even as the game progresses and horizon effects should encourage self-interest, they do not switch into a low-contribution, last-round exploitation mode. Instead, they maintain or return to very high contributions at the end, despite clear evidence that high giving is not reciprocated by all others. This indicates that their cooperative stance is not contingent on future reciprocity or repeated-interaction incentives; they appear to cooperate as a standing principle rather than as a forward-looking strategic investment. Their awareness of the final round does not substantially erode their willingness to contribute, implying that their behavior is guided more by stable norms or identity (“I am the kind of player who contributes”) than by backward induction or end-game logic.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThe player observes pronounced free-riding by some others and corresponding payoff advantages for those low contributors, yet continues to contribute at a high level. They do make a modest downward adjustment after seeing clear one-sided exploitation, which indicates they notice and care about others’ behavior to some degree, but they stop well short of matching selfish play. Even when others’ higher payoffs make their own relative disadvantage salient, they do not retaliate or attempt to equalize outcomes through strategic withholding. In an environment without punishment or reward tools, they respond more by reaffirming their cooperative norm than by trying to discipline or mirror others’ strategies. Overall, they appear tolerant of inequality and exploitation, prioritizing their own commitment to cooperation over reactive responses to others’ payoffs."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a stable, moderate contributor who anchors on a fixed middle value and does not adjust to the group. Their contributions sit well below the group’s initial cooperative norm yet above the clear free-riders, suggesting a “hedging” strategy: they avoid the extremes of full cooperation and full defection. They show no responsiveness to changes in others’ behavior or to shifts in the group’s average contribution; their chosen level remains constant despite large variation around them. This indicates low conditionality and a weak or absent reciprocity norm: they do not reward high contribution by increasing their own, nor do they punish low contribution by decreasing it. They appear to prioritize a balance between earning individually and not looking like the worst cooperator, rather than maximizing collective welfare. Their behavior is consistent with a payoff-focused, individually rational type that is willing to free-ride partially while maintaining a moderate cooperative “signal.” Risk tolerance appears limited: instead of experimenting with higher or lower contributions as the game unfolds, they stick to a safe, pre-chosen rule.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nAwareness of the finite horizon does not alter this player’s behavior. There is no visible end-game defection spike or cooperative “last stand”; the contribution rule they use remains unchanged through the final period. This suggests they either do not strategically reason about backward induction or, if they do, they still prefer a fixed, rule-based contribution over opportunistic last-round exploitation. They treat each round similarly, indicating low sensitivity to the number of remaining rounds and little interest in timing their cooperation or defection.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThis player observes that some peers consistently contribute much more and earn less, while others contribute much less and earn more, yet they do not adjust in response to these outcome patterns. They neither move toward the high-contribution norm of the more cooperative players nor toward the lower-contribution strategy that yields higher payoffs for free-riders. This suggests limited social comparison and weak payoff-driven learning within the short game. They do not appear motivated to match others’ payoffs, correct perceived unfairness, or retaliate against low contributors through their own behavior. Their stance toward inequality is behaviorally neutral: they tolerate both others’ disadvantage (high contributors earning less) and others’ advantage (low contributors earning more) without changing their own strategy. Emotional reactions and underlying beliefs about fairness or trust are unknown; only a behavioral pattern of persistence and low reactivity to others’ outcomes is evident."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a high, almost unconditional cooperator during most of the game. They consistently give the maximum possible amount whenever they contribute, and they do so regardless of whether others are fully cooperating or partially defecting. They do not appear to condition their contribution on previous free-riding by others; they continue to contribute fully even when some group members give nothing. There is one clear, deliberate deviation: they exploit the final round by contributing nothing while everyone else contributes the maximum. Earlier, there is at least one instance where others notice they “almost” missed the full-group contribution, suggesting a brief timing/attention issue rather than a strategic defection, as their recorded contribution that round is still maximal. Overall, their pattern fits a “cooperate throughout, defect at the very end” strategy: they prioritize group efficiency for most of the horizon, then take a pure payoff-maximizing action when reputation and future reciprocity no longer matter. They show no visible concern about intra-group fairness beyond their own consistent cooperation; they tolerate others’ temporary confusion or low contributions without retaliating via their own contributions.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThey communicate very little and almost never initiate coordination. Their only notable chat is a short, playful response when another player calls out that they nearly ruined perfect group coordination, and they respond with a light-hearted, self-aware remark. They neither explain strategy nor correct others’ misunderstandings, leaving that role to more vocal players. Their tone is humorous and relaxed rather than defensive or apologetic, even when others teasingly monitor their behavior. This suggests they are socially attuned enough to engage in banter but prefer low verbal engagement and do not take a leadership or persuasion role. They do not use chat to threaten, shame, or pressure defectors, and they do not explicitly justify their final-round defection. Overall, their style is minimally talkative, socially easygoing, and non-confrontational.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThey demonstrate clear horizon awareness. When other players explicitly note that only a small number of rounds remain, this player continues to contribute fully through the penultimate round, maintaining cooperation while mutual benefit is still meaningful. In the very last round, however, they abruptly switch from full contribution to complete free-riding while everyone else still contributes maximally. They do not alter their reward behavior at the end (they never reward at any time), but they do change their contribution strategy exactly when future repercussions are impossible. This pattern indicates an end-game defection consistent with standard backward-induction logic in public goods games: they are willing to behave cooperatively across repeated interactions but revert to purely self-interested behavior when the game cannot continue and when social sanctions (formal or informal) no longer matter.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey never spend any resources on rewarding others, despite being repeatedly rewarded themselves. This holds in high-cooperation phases and in mixed phases with partial defection by others. Their behavior suggests that they do not treat the reward mechanism as a useful strategic tool for sustaining cooperation, nor as an avenue for expressing gratitude. They appear content to free-ride on others’ willingness to fund positive incentives: they benefit from a cooperative environment and occasional rewards without making any direct material investment in reinforcing it. Whether this is driven by indifference to the reward mechanism, a deliberate payoff-maximizing choice, or simple inertia is unknown, but functionally they behave as a non-rewarder throughout.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThey receive small amounts of reward across many rounds from multiple others, including during early mixed-cooperation phases and during stable full cooperation. There is no evidence that they respond to specific rewarders in any targeted way: they do not start rewarding anyone in return, nor do they publicly thank or acknowledge generosity in chat. Their contributions remain consistently high regardless of whether they are rewarded or not, so their cooperative behavior does not appear to be reinforced or altered by receiving rewards. They neither build visible “alliances” through reciprocal rewarding nor differentiate between generous rewarders and non-rewarders in their own actions. The best description is that they are reward-insensitive in behavior: they accept rewards passively but do not modify strategy in response.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey observe others’ outcomes—including extreme generosity in some players’ reward spending and occasional free-riding in contributions—but show no explicit, strategic response. They do not punish free-riders through lower contributions or reduced cooperation; instead, they maintain full contributions even after seeing that some players keep all their endowments. They also do not “reward the rewarders” despite seeing some players spend substantial amounts boosting others’ payoffs. Their only social reaction visible in the transcript is a playful message after being called out for almost undermining collective success; they respond with humor rather than with concern over relative payoffs or reputational damage. There are no signs of envy or resentment toward those who earn higher payoffs by defecting, nor of moralistic reactions to over-generous or under-generous strategies by others. Overall, they appear behaviorally tolerant and unreactive: others’ payoff patterns, reward expenditures, and contribution deviations do not visibly change their own choices, aside from their own planned final-round defection."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a generally high, near-fully cooperative contributor once they understand the game mechanics. They start by following the initial coordination call to contribute fully, then briefly defect once while expressing confusion and frustration about the interface/rules rather than strategic intent to free-ride. After that, they consistently contribute the maximum, including in the final rounds, with no visible decline at the end of the game. Their cooperation appears conditionally motivated by group norms and clarity rather than by calculating short-term advantage. They show no evidence of exploiting others when some players defect; instead, they continue to contribute fully even when a subset free-rides. They appear risk-accepting regarding trusting the group: they keep contributing even after seeing that non-contributors earn higher payoffs in some rounds, suggesting a preference for norm adherence and group success over payoff maximization.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThey communicate sparsely but in a friendly, affiliative tone. Early on, they openly admit not understanding the rules and ask whether they have contributed, signaling low familiarity with the mechanics and a willingness to be transparent rather than to hide confusion. They respond to coordination efforts with brief agreement and later participate in light social banter (country/region sharing, “international” comments), indicating an interest in group bonding once the cooperation norm is stable. Their style is reactive rather than leading: they do not initiate coordination strategies, instruct others, or confront defectors; instead, they align themselves with the dominant cooperative narrative and contribute to positive group atmosphere. When the interface feels confusing or outcomes are surprising, they express this as “mental” rather than as accusation, so their engagement is non-confrontational and socially smooth.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThey show strong horizon-insensitive cooperation. Even when the remaining number of rounds becomes explicit and others mention the approaching end, they keep contributing the full amount with no sign of end-game unraveling. They do not reduce contributions in the last round despite at least one visible defector, suggesting that their behavior is guided more by norm consistency and possibly experiment-compliance than by backward induction. There is no evidence that they become more self-focused or more opportunistic as the game closes; instead, their pattern remains stable and cooperative.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey never spend their own coins to reward others, despite repeated opportunities and despite many others using the reward mechanism extensively. This suggests they place a higher value on retaining their own payoff than on actively reinforcing others’ cooperation via costly signals. Their willingness to contribute but not to reward implies a distinction in their mind between “doing their part” (contributing) and “using extra resources to influence outcomes” (rewarding), with the latter apparently not part of their strategy. There is no sign that they strategically reward to shape others’ behavior or reciprocate; their approach to rewards is purely passive. Motivation for non-rewarding is unclear (could be payoff-maximizing, could be uncertainty about how/why to use rewards, or a belief that cooperation is already stable and does not need reinforcement), but their consistent zero spending suggests a stable trait rather than momentary oversight.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThey receive small positive rewards in many rounds, but there is no observable change in their own rewarding behavior in response; they continue to spend nothing on rewards throughout. This indicates that they do not practice direct reciprocity through the reward channel: being rewarded does not trigger them to reward back. Their cooperative contributions also do not change as a function of being rewarded versus not rewarded; they continue contributing maximally once they have grasped the mechanics, regardless of reward inflows. This pattern portrays them as appreciative in behavior (they stay cooperative) but not reciprocally active through the same mechanism. They do not explicitly thank rewarders in chat or single them out, suggesting either that they are not attending closely to the detailed reward structure, that they see rewards as secondary, or that they prefer to keep chat light and non-instrumental.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey show limited explicit concern with the detailed payoff and reward patterns of others. Early on, when contributions and outcomes are confusing, they voice confusion about the system and their own actions rather than about fairness or others’ gains. They do not call out defectors or free-riders by name, do not criticize those who earn more by contributing less, and do not comment on heavy rewarders or their lower resulting payoffs. Their chat focuses on understanding the rules and on mild social commentary rather than on outcome monitoring. This suggests they track the broad cooperative norm (everyone should contribute fully) but do not invest cognitive or emotional effort into policing or analyzing individuals’ payoff trajectories. Their response to others’ outcomes is therefore tolerant, low-conflict, and relatively non-strategic, consistent with a “quiet cooperator” who cares more about doing the normatively right thing and enjoying the group context than about optimizing or enforcing payoff fairness."

They begin by free-riding when others are coordinating toward full contributions, but explicitly state confusion about whether they have contributed, suggesting the initial non-cooperation is at least partly due to misunderstanding rather than a clear exploitative intent. After receiving explanations from others, they settle into a stable pattern of full contributions for the majority of the game, even when some others sometimes defect and even in the final round. They do not appear to condition their own contributions strongly on others’ most recent behavior: they keep contributing fully through mid- and late game, including when some players free-ride and when end-game temptations are present. They seem willing to sacrifice individual payoff for group efficiency once the norm is clear, and they remain cooperative even when marginal incentives in the very last round would favor defection. Their behavior is more consistent with a “confused early learner who becomes a norm-following cooperator” than with a calculating conditional cooperator or persistent free-rider.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nTheir communication is sparse, reactive, and mostly informational. They respond to others rather than initiating coordination. Early on, they openly admit confusion about whether they have contributed, and later reiterate that they find the situation confusing, which indicates low strategic sophistication or comfort with the interface and rules. They follow others’ guidance on how to play rather than pushing their own interpretation or norms. They also join light social talk (e.g., sharing country) when that emerges, showing willingness to engage socially but not to drive the conversation. Their tone is neutral to mildly affiliative; there is no evidence of criticism, blame, or attempts to pressure free-riders. Overall, they are a low-talk participant who is honest about not understanding, receptive to group guidance, and not confrontational.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThey are explicitly informed how many rounds remain via the interface, and other players mention the approaching end, but there is no observable shift toward selfishness on their part near the end. They continue to contribute fully in the last rounds, including the final one, even as at least one other player defects in the very last round. Their reward spending does not show a dramatic strategic escalation or shutdown either; it remains low and similar in pattern to their earlier behavior. This suggests they either do not apply backward induction or do not prioritize it over maintaining the established cooperative norm. They appear to treat late rounds much like earlier ones, indicating a stable cooperative disposition that is not strongly sensitive to the finite horizon.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey are generally reluctant to spend on rewards. Across the game they spend only small amounts on rewarding others, and in many rounds they give no rewards at all, even when almost everyone is cooperating at maximum. When they do reward, it is modest and spread, which fits a limited, possibly symbolic use of reward rather than a strong strategic investment to shape behavior. Given that others are already near-universally cooperative and there is no punishment, they may see little need to spend to enforce norms. They are also a frequent recipient of small rewards from others, but they do not respond by matching that generosity on a large scale. Their reward behavior looks more like “occasional thanks or conformity to a minimal norm of acknowledging cooperators” than a deliberate tool for incentivizing group behavior.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThey repeatedly receive small, positive rewards from others, including in early rounds when their own contribution pattern is not perfectly cooperative. There is no clear pattern of targeted reciprocity: they do not shift into heavy rewarding of those who reward them, and they do not significantly increase their reward spending in response to being favored. Their small reward outlays appear weakly related, at best, to whether they themselves were rewarded; the behavior is more consistent with a generally low propensity to reward combined with occasional gestures rather than forming alliances or tit-for-tat reciprocity. If anything, they accept rewards passively and continue their own low-reward, high-contribution strategy without strong adjustment to who has supported them.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey pay attention enough to notice their own status and express confusion about whether they have contributed, implying some monitoring of outcomes, but they do not comment on others’ payoffs, reward costs, or apparent exploitation. They do not publicly criticize free-riders, praise generous rewarders, or otherwise react in chat to the visible heterogeneity in others’ costs and gains. Even when one player spends extremely heavily on rewards and others remark on this, they remain silent about it. Their behavior suggests a focus on their own understanding and participation rather than on judging or steering the group based on observed outcomes. They adapt their own contributions toward the cooperative norm but do not visibly use outcome information to sanction, reward selectively, or express moral approval/disapproval. Overall, they behave as a quiet norm follower: they internalize the cooperative pattern once they comprehend it, but they leave others’ outcome disparities largely uncommented and unaddressed.\n\n"

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThe player fits a “conditional, profit‑sensitive cooperator” type with substantial within-game variability. They often choose the socially efficient contribution (putting in their full endowment) but also occasionally free‑ride completely or give moderate amounts. Their pattern is not monotonic over time; instead of a steady decline, they oscillate between high and zero contributions. This suggests they pay attention to others’ behavior and their own payoffs and are willing both to support and to exploit the group depending on context.\n\nThey clearly understand the incentives: they repeatedly choose the individually dominant free‑riding option in some rounds and the fully cooperative option in others, which is consistent with deliberate, not random, choice. They are willing to incur substantial personal cost to boost the public fund in many rounds, indicating at least a partial internalization of cooperative norms or a desire for group success, but they do not follow a strict fairness rule (they sometimes take much more than they give relative to others).\n\nTheir conditionality appears asymmetric: they do not systematically “punish” low contributions by consistently dropping to zero afterward, nor do they rigidly match others’ levels; instead they sometimes cooperate strongly even when others are mixed, and sometimes free‑ride even when others are contributing a lot. This suggests a mix of opportunism and periodic recommitment to cooperation rather than a clean reciprocity rule like “match the group average.” Risk tolerance toward “wasted” cooperation is moderate: they are willing to contribute fully even when there is clear evidence of repeated free‑riding by others, but not in every such situation.\n\nOverall, the contribution profile is: often high, sometimes zero, occasionally intermediate, with choices that appear purposeful and payoff-aware rather than random or purely altruistic.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThe player speaks very little and uses a brief, cooperative tone. At the outset they explicitly endorse a proposal for full cooperation. This aligns with a willingness to coordinate and appear prosocial in front of the group. After that, they do not initiate further strategic discussion or challenge others’ behavior. They do not confront low contributors, call out “wolves,” or respond to the mild social commentary in the chat. This indicates a low-engagement, non-confrontational communication style.\n\nThey show no evidence of trying to persuade defectors back into cooperation, and they do not publicly justify their own shifts between high and zero contributions. There is no visible attempt to signal conditionality or to threaten future behavior through words. Instead, they let their actions speak for themselves. Their social style in chat is “quiet supporter”: they initially express agreement with cooperative norms, then withdraw from discussion and focus on play rather than conversation.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThe player shows no classic “end‑game collapse” pattern. In the final segment of the game, they repeatedly choose the fully cooperative contribution, including in the very last decision. This suggests that awareness of the approaching end does not push them toward pure short‑term self-interest. Instead, they either remain aligned with cooperative norms or find it instrumentally appealing to continue contributing even when there are few or no future rounds for reciprocity.\n\nBecause their contributions fluctuate earlier and then stabilize at high levels near the end, they might be using a simple heuristic like “finish strong/cooperative,” or they might be indifferent to the finite horizon implications. There is no visible attempt to “cash out” by defecting in the last round once future retaliation is impossible.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThe player observes detailed feedback about others’ contributions and payoffs and clearly adapts somewhat, but their reactions are mixed. They do not comment on others’ earnings in chat, do not shame low contributors, and do not explicitly praise high contributors. They also do not systematically align their contributions with any one subgroup of players. Instead, they sometimes exploit high-contributing groups by free‑riding and sometimes join them with full cooperation.\n\nTheir alternation between free-riding and contributing suggests they are sensitive to the payoff consequences of others’ behavior: when others are generous, free‑riding is very profitable, and they occasionally take that option; when they value group returns or perhaps reputation or self-image more, they revert to full contributions. However, there is no clear evidence that specific payoff patterns or specific individuals’ outcomes drive these changes; the mapping from observed outcomes to their behavior is noisy. Their response to others’ outcomes can be summarized as “quietly opportunistic but periodically prosocial,” without explicit social enforcement via communication."

Contributions span the entire range from zero to the full endowment, with many intermediate values and no simple linear trend. The player is clearly sensitive to context, but their rule is not a simple “match others” or “always cooperate/defect” pattern.\n\nThey sometimes fully exploit cooperative environments by contributing nothing while many others contribute a lot, securing very high payoffs. At other times, in similarly cooperative environments, they contribute the full endowment or nearly all of it. This indicates that payoff-maximization is salient but not the only driver; they are willing to incur substantial personal cost to contribute when they choose to, even when others’ cooperation is already high.\n\nThey does not adhere to a strong fairness norm like equalizing contributions. They often take advantage of high contributors without compensating later in a systematic way. Yet they also voluntarily join cooperative surges with large contributions, which suggests a situational willingness to support group efficiency rather than a pure selfish type.\n\nConditionality is present but noisy. The player seems more willing to contribute high amounts when others are visibly cooperating; however, the same cooperative environment sometimes elicits zero contributions from them. This inconsistency suggests exploration, opportunism, or mood-based decision-making rather than a rigid reciprocity rule.\n\nRisk tolerance appears moderate to high in social terms: the player is willing to contribute fully even when some others are clearly defecting, accepting the risk of being exploited. At the same time, they also take opportunistic low-risk free-rider positions when cooperation is robust, indicating comfort with both cooperative and exploitative strategies.\n\nOverall, the contribution profile fits a “flexible opportunistic cooperator”: someone who understands the gains from public contributions and takes part in them, but is also willing to defect when it looks especially rewarding or when they feel like it, without strong evidence of guilt or strict norm-following.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThe player remains completely silent in the chat throughout the game. They neither initiate nor respond to any messages, including direct or indirect normative appeals and coordination attempts from others. This indicates a low-engagement or deliberately observant communication style.\n\nThey do not attempt to persuade, negotiate, or justify their contribution choices, even when their actions diverge starkly from cooperative suggestions in the chat. This suggests they either do not prioritize maintaining a positive social image in this setting or they assume anonymity makes such concerns irrelevant.\n\nThe lack of reactive chat, even when others discuss “wolves,” zeros, and selfishness, implies that the player either does not feel compelled to defend or explain themselves, or prefers to keep their intentions opaque. Their style is non-confrontational by omission: they neither criticize others nor praise them.\n\nFrom this transcript alone, it is unknown whether their silence reflects shyness, strategic opacity, disinterest in social interaction, or simple focus on payoffs. What is clear is that they do not use communication as a tool for coordination or norm-enforcement.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThe player shows no clear collapse of cooperation in the final rounds; instead, they maintain or increase high contributions near the end. Their last few decisions include multiple very high contributions, including near or at the maximum, despite the known finite horizon and the absence of future punishment or reward.\n\nThis pattern suggests that they does not follow the canonical backward-induction logic that would dictate more defection near the end. Instead, they either treat end-game rounds similarly to mid-game ones or even lean into cooperation when the end approaches.\n\nThere is no visible attempt to “cash out” by sharply lowering contributions in the final opportunities. This indicates either a preference for maintaining or signaling a cooperative stance through the end, a stable internal preference for contributing when in that mindset, or a lack of strong horizon-based planning.\n\nOverall, the player’s end-game response is to continue a mixed but often generous strategy, rather than to exploit the final rounds.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThe player observes detailed feedback on others’ contributions and payoffs every round, but does not verbally comment on them. Behaviorally, they sometimes exploit others’ high contributions by choosing zero and earning high payoffs while others earn less, and at other times they accept lower payoffs by contributing heavily alongside cooperators.\n\nThere is no evidence that they directly reward or punish others, and in this setting no formal reward or punishment mechanism exists. Their indirect “punishment” or “reward” via contributions is inconsistent: they does not systematically increase contributions to help previously exploited players, nor do they consistently reduce contributions in response to any specific individual’s behavior.\n\nThe player tolerates being exploited as well: they sometimes contribute heavily while some peers free-ride and reap higher payoffs. They do not visibly retaliate in a targeted way against these apparent free-riders; subsequent choices alternate between high and low contributions without a clear link to specific others’ payoffs.\n\nTheir reaction to group-level outcomes seems more aggregate and opportunistic than personalized. They appear comfortable in environments where some get much more or less than others, without trying to correct or stabilize those disparities. Emotionally or normatively, their stance toward others’ outcomes is unknown; behaviorally, they accept both being exploited and exploiting others as part of the game, without explicit complaint or compensation."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a generally high contributor with moderate downward flexibility. Their typical choice is to give a substantial portion of their endowment, often above the group average, but they do not rigidly stick to full cooperation. They alternate between full and partial contributions rather than drifting into persistent free-riding. When group contributions fall, they reduce their own giving somewhat but maintain clearly cooperative levels instead of retaliating to the minimum. When the group appears more cooperative, they respond by sustaining or increasing their own contributions rather than exploiting. They show some concern for personal payoff, as seen in occasional lower contributions, but overall prioritize group efficiency and fairness. Their pattern suggests conditional cooperation with a relatively high personal standard and moderate risk tolerance for being exploited: they are willing to keep giving even when others free-ride, but they do not maximize personal income by systematically under-contributing.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThis player is mostly quiet and observant, engaging minimally in chat. They do not initiate coordination early, nor do they try to organize or enforce group norms during the main part of the game. They show no evidence of confronting specific individuals, persuading them, or joining ongoing joking/teasing dynamics. Their sole explicit statement is a brief self-reflective comment near the end, where they characterize the group (or possibly themselves) as “selfish,” indicating that they are monitoring the social environment and have a moral or evaluative lens on cooperation. The tone of that remark is resigned rather than aggressive; it does not attempt to shame or rally others, just to acknowledge the situation. Overall, they lean toward low-visibility, low-conflict participation: they cooperate behaviorally but do not try to lead, argue, or negotiate.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nAwareness of the finite horizon does not push this player into a clear cooperative collapse. In late rounds, their contributions fluctuate but remain mostly high, including fully cooperative decisions very near the end. They do briefly lower their contribution just before the final round, which increases their own payoff substantially, suggesting some strategic attention to personal earnings as the game concludes. However, they then immediately return to full contribution in the final round even though the game is about to end and others’ behavior offers an opportunity to free-ride. This combination indicates mixed motives: they balance payoff maximization with a persistent cooperative norm, and they are not purely backward-inducting. The self-referential comment about selfishness appears in the final round and coincides with them choosing to contribute fully, which implies that, despite recognizing or anticipating selfish behavior around them (or in themselves earlier), they end the game reaffirming a cooperative identity. Overall, their end-game strategy shows only mild decay and some internal tension between norm-following and self-interest.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThis player is clearly attentive to the broader outcome structure but does not react in a strongly punitive or vengeful way. When others earn more through low contributions, they do not sharply retaliate by dropping to minimal contributions. Instead, they adjust moderately, staying within a cooperative range. They also do not engage in chat to call out specific high-earning free-riders, even when payoff differences are salient. Their later behavior suggests that seeing others benefit from selfishness does not fully erode their willingness to contribute; they sometimes even increase contributions after such patterns. Their one explicit evaluative comment about selfishness indicates they interpret outcome patterns through a fairness lens, but they internalize this mostly as observation rather than as a trigger for active sanctioning. In sum, they are a tolerant, mildly conditional cooperator: sensitive to inequity and exploitation, but reluctant to escalate or withdraw cooperation solely in response to others’ advantageous outcomes."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a strict, unconditional full contributor. They always give the entire endowment to the public fund and never deviate, even as others fluctuate and as their own relative payoff is persistently lower than that of several group members. There is no evidence of conditional cooperation; their behavior does not adjust upward or downward in response to higher or lower average contributions, nor to changes in who is contributing more or less. They appear to hold a strong internal norm that “the right thing” is to fully contribute regardless of what others do, and they tolerate being exploited by lower contributors without reacting in their own contribution choice. Risk tolerance is high in the sense that they persist with full cooperation despite clear information that others free-ride and that this leaves them earning less than others. Fairness norms seem to be internally driven rather than reciprocal: they behave fairly (by contributing fully) but do not condition on whether the environment is fair to them.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey never use punishment at all, despite repeated and salient opportunities and despite the presence of clear low contributors and a powerful, high-leverage punishment technology. They also see other players frequently using punishment (in particular against a chronically low-contributing target), yet they neither join in nor imitate this behavior. This suggests a very high threshold for punishing; either they avoid harming others on principle, or they reject the cost of sanctioning as an acceptable tool, even when it would be efficient or group-beneficial. There is no sign of retaliatory punishment, as they are never punished themselves and never punish in return. There is also no sign of using punishment strategically for deterrence or norm enforcement; they do not appear to try to shape others’ contributions through negative incentives. Overall, they present as a non-punisher with strong reluctance to impose costs on others, even on clear free riders.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nUnknown. They are never the target of punishment, so there is no evidence of how they respond when punished or how they treat identifiable punishers afterward. Their tendencies toward unconditional cooperation and non-punishment suggest, with low confidence, that they would be unlikely to retaliate and might either ignore punishment or possibly interpret it as information rather than a provocation, but this is speculative.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey never use rewards, despite the mechanism being clearly explained and despite visible examples of others using positive rewards. They do not reward either high contributors who match their own behavior or players who reward them. This indicates that they do not engage in explicit positive reinforcement, alliance signaling, or gratitude expression through the reward tool. Given that they already cooperate maximally without conditioning on others, they may see rewarding as unnecessary, too costly, or outside their preferred way of interacting. Their cooperativeness is “silent”: they help the group through contributions but do not invest extra resources to shape or encourage others’ behavior via rewards.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThey receive rewards several times from specific co-players, but they never reciprocate with rewards of their own and they do not alter their contribution behavior, which is already at the maximum. There is no observable attempt to form a mutual-reward alliance or to differentially favor those who reward them versus those who do not. Their gratitude, if present, is not expressed through the available mechanisms. This suggests a style where they maintain their own cooperative standard independently of social approval or side payments, and do not translate being rewarded into explicit reciprocity via the reward tool. Whether they feel gratitude internally is unknown; behaviorally, they remain unchanged and non-reciprocal with respect to rewards.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey repeatedly observe that some players contribute less while earning higher payoffs and sometimes also face heavy punishment from others. Despite this clear evidence of free-riding, payoff inequality, and active sanctioning norms in the group, they neither adjust their own contributions nor participate in enforcement. They tolerate being a consistent net contributor who often earns less than others without any visible attempt to protect themselves or to pressure laggards. They similarly observe positive rewards flowing among others (and to themselves at times) without changing their behavior. Overall, they appear largely indifferent, in terms of strategic adjustment, to others’ payoffs, to how much others spend on punishment or reward, and to who is targeted. Their primary reference point seems to be their own internal rule to fully cooperate, not the evolving distribution of costs and benefits in the group."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a stable, unconditional high contributor. They consistently give their full endowment to the public good in every situation, regardless of others’ behavior, punishment patterns, or proximity to the final round. They appear to follow a strong internal norm that “full contribution is the right thing,” rather than conditioning on others’ average. They do not shade contributions downward even when some group members persistently free-ride or reduce their giving. This suggests a preference for efficient group outcomes and a willingness to bear personal risk that others may not reciprocate. There is no evidence of strategic under-contribution or profit-maximizing adjustment; their cooperative stance is fixed and robust across the game.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThe player shows no end-game decay in cooperation. Their contribution remains maximal through the last round, even as some others reduce their contributions and the remaining horizon shrinks to zero. This indicates that they either (a) do not prioritize final-round monetary payoff maximization, or (b) value consistency with their cooperative norm and/or enforcement motives more than short-term gain. In the final round, they escalate punitive enforcement against low contributors rather than relaxing effort, which is consistent with a desire to end the game affirming norms rather than exploiting the final move. They appear fully aware of the horizon (interface displays remaining rounds), but their behavior suggests horizon awareness does not alter their cooperative or enforcement strategy.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThe player is willing to incur substantial personal costs to punish low contributors, especially clear free-riders and persistent under-contributors. Their punishment is selective: they target those who contribute markedly less than the rest of the group, not high contributors. They do not punish indiscriminately; they ignore cooperators and focus on those whose behavior repeatedly violates the apparent contribution norm. Punishment intensity escalates over time against repeat low contributors, particularly in the final rounds, indicating a norm-enforcement or “teaching a lesson” motive rather than a one-off emotional reaction. They are willing to spend enough to drive punished players’ payoffs extremely low, even negative, which is inconsistent with pure payoff maximization and more consistent with strong negative reciprocity or altruistic punishment. There is no evidence that they punish for personal retaliation (they are never punished), so the motive appears to be deterrence, expression of disapproval, or retributive justice against free-riding rather than self-defense.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nThe player is not punished by others during the observed game, so their direct response to being punished is unknown. Because they are consistently a top contributor and a punisher rather than a target, we see no evidence of how they would react to identifiable punishment. Their likely willingness to maintain high contributions in the face of others’ negative actions is suggested by their overall rigidity, but this is speculative and therefore low confidence.\n\n<REWARD>\nThe player never uses the reward option, despite having many opportunities to do so and being surrounded by several consistently high contributors. This suggests either that they view costly reward as inefficient (since the technology is payoff-destroying) or that their social preference is primarily punitive rather than prosocial-reciprocal. Their behavior fits a “carrot-averse, stick-accepting” pattern: they are willing to pay to reduce free-riders’ outcomes but are not willing to pay, at a loss, to increase cooperators’ payoffs. This may reflect a norm that good behavior is expected and does not merit extra compensation, while bad behavior deserves sanction. It may also reflect attention focus: they appear to key on deviations below the norm, not above it.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThe player is never rewarded by others, so there is no direct evidence on how they respond to being rewarded or to identifiable rewarders. Their cooperative behavior is already maximal and stable, so any additional reinforcement, if it occurred, might not change their actions. Their reaction style (gratitude, alliance formation, increased leniency) is unknown.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThe player appears to track others’ contribution levels and how heavily they are already being sanctioned. They do not automatically “pile on” every low contributor each round; instead, they sometimes refrain from punishing when others are already heavily sanctioning, and at other times they join in or escalate punishment when under-contribution persists. They never direct sanctions or rewards toward high contributors, suggesting a clear internal mapping between observed contributions and deserved outcomes. Their later strong sanctions suggest that they infer persistent under-contributors are intentionally exploiting the group, and they become more willing to impose very harsh monetary consequences on them over time. They do not respond visibly to how much others punish or reward beyond aligning their own pattern with the contribution behavior of targets; there is no evidence of meta-punishment (punishing punishers) or conflict with other enforcers. Overall, they use others’ outcomes primarily as information about who is free-riding and how effective sanctions have been, and then adjust punishment intensity upward against recalcitrant low contributors while leaving cooperators untouched."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThe player is a “principled high contributor with mild downward adjustment.” They generally favor contributing the full endowment to the public good and show a strong cooperative baseline. Across the game, their chosen contributions are consistently at or near the maximum, with only modest reductions at times rather than large deviations. This indicates a stable cooperative disposition rather than opportunistic free-riding.\n\nTheir behavior suggests a fairness norm that prioritizes strong group provision even when others contribute somewhat less. They do not appear to condition their own contribution tightly on any single peer’s low contribution; instead, they maintain high contributions even in the presence of repeated under-contributors. The small downward adjustments hint at some sensitivity to emerging free-riding or declining averages, but these adjustments are tentative and limited rather than a decisive shift toward defection.\n\nRisk tolerance appears moderate: the player repeatedly chooses the payoff-dominated but socially beneficial option of high contribution, despite the possibility of others exploiting this. They continue to take on the risk of being a “sucker” even after being personally punished and after observing variability and some persistent low contributors in the group. This pattern aligns with a player who values cooperative norms, possibly expects that relatively high cooperation is sustainable, and is willing to incur personal cost to support that outcome.\n\nThey do not show strong end-game unraveling: contributions remain high through the final rounds, with no clear collapse into self-interested taking. Given that round length is unknown to them, their strategy looks like a stationary or slowly adapting cooperative rule rather than a countdown-based plan.\n\nOverall, the player behaves like a conditional cooperator with a high intrinsic contribution target and only weak negative reciprocity expressed through contribution changes. They appear willing to “do their part” for the group even when some others do not fully match their level.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThe player never uses the punishment option at any point, despite repeated opportunities and the presence of clear low contributors and instances where they themselves are punished. This reveals several features of their punishment preferences.\n\nFirst, their baseline willingness to punish is effectively zero under the given conditions. They refrain from sanctioning both clear free-riders and more moderate under-contributors, even when the punishment technology is relatively efficient. This makes it unlikely that they are a strong norm enforcer or altruistic punisher in this environment.\n\nSecond, they do not retaliate when they are personally targeted by punishment, including in a situation where they receive substantial deductions while having behaved cooperatively. Their subsequent decisions show no evidence of revenge, escalation, or even symbolic punishment in response. This strongly suggests low retaliatory motivation and a high tolerance for being treated unfairly without striking back.\n\nThird, their abstention from punishment is consistent across early, mid, and late stages of the game. This stability implies a general strategy or principle—such as avoiding costly negative actions, rejecting the role of “enforcer,” or prioritizing personal earnings and cooperation over conflict—rather than moment-specific hesitation.\n\nTheir behavior does not allow precise inference about whether this abstention is driven by a cost-benefit calculation (e.g., viewing punishment as too expensive), moral aversion to harming others, pessimism about punishment’s effectiveness, or uncertainty about who is responsible for prior sanctions. The lack of any experimentation with punishment means underlying beliefs about deterrence are unknown. What can be said with confidence is that, in this setting, the player adopts a non-punitive, non-retaliatory stance even while cooperating at a high level."

Once they reach full contribution, they maintain it without experimenting or scaling back, even when others’ contributions are uneven and some group members persistently give little or nothing. They appear to hold a strong internal norm that the appropriate action is to contribute the maximum, independent of short‑term personal payoff.\n\nTheir behavior suggests they prioritize an efficiency/fairness ideal of full cooperation over narrow self-interest. They do not try to fine‑tune contributions to match the group average or to “teach” others via conditional contributions (e.g., they do not visibly reduce contribution in response to free riding). This indicates low strategic risk‑taking and a preference for a simple, principled rule (“always give everything”) rather than contingent strategies.\n\nThey seem tolerant of payoff risk: they forgo the individually optimal selfish strategy (keeping most or all of their endowment) without evidence that others will reciprocate fully, and they continue this long after it is clear that some players chronically undercontribute. This pattern is consistent with either (a) strong prosocial preferences or (b) a belief that stable, high cooperation is attainable and worth pursuing even when others deviate.\n\nBecause they never switch away from full contribution once they reach it, their adaptability in contribution decisions is low; they update via punishment rather than via changing their own contribution. Any belief updating about others’ types or about the game seems to show up in who they punish, not in how much they give.\n\nOverall, they function as a reliable, high‑commitment cooperator who treats contribution as a moral or rule‑based obligation, not a negotiable response to the group.\n\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThis player is a “norm-enforcing, selectively punitive cooperator” who uses punishment regularly but not indiscriminately. They are clearly willing to pay a nontrivial personal cost to sanction others. However, they do not punish every time deviations exist, and they do not escalate into broad, unfocused punishment; their use of sanctions appears targeted and context‑sensitive.\n\nTheir punishments are most consistent with enforcing a contribution norm rather than personal retaliation. They themselves are always at the cooperative extreme, yet they only sometimes punish low contributors, and they do not respond in kind when they are personally targeted by punishment while contributing maximally. After being punished, they neither reduce contributions nor counter‑punish; instead, they simply stop using the punishment option for a time. This is more compatible with withdrawing from costly enforcement than with a vengeful style.\n\nThey appear particularly sensitive to conspicuous free riding or repeated low contributions by specific others, especially when those low contributions stand out against a generally cooperative environment. When the group overall is contributing very highly, they show less need to sanction. This suggests a threshold rule: they punish when norm violations are salient or when certain players seem to persist in low contributions despite a cooperative majority.\n\nThey do not seem motivated by spite or payoff maximization through punishment. The cumulative pattern shows that sanctions are a net cost to them that they nevertheless accept, which aligns with a deterrence/discipline motive: they are willing to sacrifice private payoff to uphold what they perceive as the appropriate contribution standard for the group. At the same time, they are not a “punishment fanatic”: they sometimes refrain from punishing even in the presence of obvious low contributors, suggesting an internal trade‑off between norm enforcement and conserving resources.\n\nIn new environments, this type is expected to:\n- Contribute at or near the maximum from the outset.\n- Use punishment as a tool to police undercontribution, especially when deviations are stark or repeated.\n- Avoid retaliatory punishment even when personally targeted.\n- Disengage from punishing (rather than from cooperating) if punishment seems costly or ineffective, while maintaining high contributions throughout."

They always allocate their entire endowment to the public fund, with no adjustments in response to changes in group behavior, personal losses, or observed free-riding. Their cooperation is extremely stable and not contingent on others’ contributions, even when they are relatively high compared to several peers and even after being targeted by punishment. This suggests a strong internal norm to “do the maximum cooperative thing” rather than a payoff-maximizing strategy.\n\nThey appear to prioritize group efficiency over personal earnings: contributing fully is individually costly in this parameter setting, but they never deviate. There is no evidence that they attempt to optimize against the marginal per-capita return; instead, they seem to act as if contributing fully is the “right” baseline, independent of whether it strictly increases their own payoff.\n\nThey tolerate substantial heterogeneity and persistent under-contribution by some others without reducing their own contribution. This indicates a fairness norm focused on their own behavior (“I should contribute fully”) rather than reciprocity-based fairness (“I match what others do”). Their risk tolerance with respect to exploitation by free-riders is high: they repeatedly expose themselves to the risk of earning less relative to low contributors but persist in full cooperation.\n\nBecause they never change their contribution level, their learning and adaptation on the contribution dimension are either absent or extremely limited; if beliefs about others’ cooperativeness update, those belief changes do not translate into behavioral adjustment in contributions. Overall, they behave as a principled, high-commitment cooperator whose cooperative identity dominates short-run monetary incentives.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThis player is generally non-punitive but not categorically opposed to punishment. Across most opportunities, they abstain from punishing despite the presence of clear free-riders and low contributors. This pattern suggests that punishment is not their default tool for enforcing norms; they likely accept some level of exploitation without intervening.\n\nThey do, however, punish on one occasion. That punishment occurs in a context where their own contribution remains maximal and several others contribute substantially less. Because the target of their punishment is unobservable here, their exact trigger is uncertain. The most plausible interpretation is that they occasionally engage in selective, norm-enforcing punishment toward conspicuous under-contributors rather than retaliating against those who punished them earlier or punishing moderate deviations. The fact that they previously suffered substantial deductions yet did not respond with immediate or repeated punishment makes a pure retaliation motive less likely, though not fully excludable.\n\nTheir one act of punishment is limited in scale relative to what would be possible, suggesting they do not pursue aggressive, repeated sanctioning to reshape group behavior; instead, they behave more like a reluctant norm enforcer who is willing to spend a small amount to sanction behavior they perceive as especially unfair or harmful to cooperation.\n\nThey never escalate into a sustained punishment campaign, even though free-riding persists and they themselves are never seen as a low contributor. This implies that deterrence is at best a weak or secondary motive for them; they are not systematically trying to engineer higher group contributions via targeted sanctions. Overall, they present as a principled cooperator with a strong bias against using punishment, who only occasionally and modestly deploys it, likely in response to perceived severe norm violations rather than as an ongoing strategic instrument."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a strict, unwavering full cooperator. They always contribute their entire endowment, with no experimentation or decay, regardless of others’ behavior, the punishment environment, or the approaching end of the game. Their cooperation is unconditional rather than tit‑for‑tat: they continue to fully contribute even when low contributors persist and even when they themselves incur large costs from punishing or rewarding. This suggests they treat full contribution as a normative rule (“the right thing to do”), not a fragile strategy contingent on others. They appear risk‑tolerant about potentially being exploited by low contributors, prioritizing group efficiency or fairness norms over own short‑term payoff. There is no evidence that they adjust contributions based on earnings, punishment they give, or patterns of others’ cooperation; their contribution behavior is highly stable and rigid.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThere is no end‑game decay in cooperation: they maintain full contributions through the final round. However, their use of sanctioning shifts somewhat: they employ both punishment and reward in earlier and mid stages, and remain willing to use costly punishment up to the last round. This indicates horizon awareness does not lead them to “cash out” or relax norms; if anything, they uphold contribution standards to the very end. Their normative stance on contribution appears time‑invariant. Whether they consciously anticipate that future interactions are limited is unknown, but their behavior is consistent with a player who values norm enforcement independently of future strategic gain.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey are willing to incur substantial personal costs to punish, but they do so selectively, triggered mainly by marked deviations from what looks like their internal cooperation standard. Targets are typically very low contributors compared to the group, and they focus especially on extreme or repeated low contributors. They occasionally expand punishment to moderate under‑contributors when their deviation is large relative to a highly cooperative environment. They never punish high contributors or evident cooperators.\n\nThey sometimes coordinate their punishment with what others seem to be doing (e.g., joining collective sanctions on chronic low contributors), which suggests a belief that punishment is appropriate for norm violators and perhaps more effective when multiple players participate. They sometimes allocate multiple punishment units across several low contributors in a single decision, indicating they are motivated by enforcing a general cooperation norm rather than a single, personalized grudge.\n\nTheir punishment pattern appears primarily deterrence‑ or norm‑driven (altruistic punishment) rather than retaliatory: they are not being personally targeted by others, yet they pay large amounts to reduce defectors’ payoffs. They do not use punishment against players who punish others, or against high contributors who might threaten their relative payoff, which suggests low competitiveness and low spite. When a player contributes nothing while others remain highly cooperative, they react with clear punitive action, even in the final round, consistent with a strong intolerance of blatant free‑riding.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nThey are never punished in this game, so their behavioral response to being punished is unknown. There is no evidence of retaliatory tendencies toward punishers, nor of compliance after being sanctioned, because they do not experience sanctions. Given their unwavering cooperation across all rounds, they already comply with a strict norm of contribution, so any hypothetical punishment would be norm‑incongruent and their reaction is uncertain.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey use rewards fairly often and in a pattern that is clearly contingent on others’ cooperation levels. They reserve rewards for consistently high contributors or those who match or exceed the group norm, and they never reward clear under‑contributors. They frequently direct rewards to the same cooperative individuals across multiple opportunities, indicating an attempt to reinforce and encourage a stable coalition of high contributors. They sometimes use reward alone, and sometimes mix it with punishment in the same decision, suggesting they view reward and punishment as complementary tools: reward to support cooperators, punishment to correct defectors.\n\nThey are willing to sacrifice substantial own earnings to provide these rewards, even when the reward technology is merely break‑even (no social multiplier). This implies they are not using reward purely as an instrumental payoff‑maximizing tool but as a normative or relational signal—supporting “good citizens” of the group. Their reward allocation seems strategic in a social sense (reinforcing desirable behavior and perhaps fostering allegiance), but not narrowly self‑interested in terms of immediate income.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThey receive occasional rewards from others, but their own behavior (full contributions plus targeted reward and punishment) does not appear to change in direct response. They do not explicitly reciprocate rewards in a one‑to‑one fashion; rather, they continue to reward high contributors in general, some of whom also reward them and some of whom do not. This suggests they operate on a rule like “reward good cooperators” rather than “reward my rewarders.” They do not form a visible exclusive alliance with any single rewarder; instead, their reward behavior remains principled and pattern‑based.\n\nTheir continued generosity toward certain high contributors, even without direct reciprocation from those specific players in some periods, hints at a stable cooperative orientation rather than purely dyadic reciprocity. That said, because they are themselves often in the set of top cooperators, they may expect that maintaining a cooperative core will in aggregate benefit them, but this expectation is inferred with low confidence.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey pay close attention to others’ contributions and to the sanctioning environment, and they condition their punishments and rewards on those outcomes. When they see low contributors being sanctioned by others, they often join in or maintain pressure on those same players, consistent with endorsing a shared norm of high contribution. When they see very high contributors, they tend to reward them, even if those players already have strong payoffs, indicating they care more about reinforcing behavior than equalizing incomes.\n\nThey do not appear concerned with strict payoff equality. They do not punish successful high earners who contribute fully, nor do they reward low earners whose low income stems from having been punished for free‑riding. Their reactions are aligned with contribution behavior, not with final payoff levels per se. They seem comfortable allowing punished defectors to end up very poor if that reflects their prior under‑contribution.\n\nThey are willing to incur large costs in rounds where their own payoff becomes very low relative to others due to heavy use of punishment and reward. This shows they tolerate short‑term personal loss when using sanctions to influence group behavior. There is no sign that they later “compensate” themselves by defecting or by exploiting unpunished others; they continue to contribute fully and to sanction according to their norm. Overall, they behave as a principled, strong‑norm altruistic cooperator: they track others’ actions closely, respond sharply to norm violations, reinforce high cooperation, and accept personal cost to maintain a high‑contribution environment."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a stable, unconditional high contributor. They always give the full endowment, with no variation, regardless of others’ behavior, fluctuations in group contributions, or aggressive punishment dynamics in the group. They do not appear to condition their contributions on others’ past choices, on being rewarded, or on the presence of chronic low contributors. This indicates a strong internal cooperation norm that does not update with experience, rather than a calculated best response to the environment. They tolerate being among the highest contributors without attempting to free-ride or “balance” fairness ex post. Risk tolerance is high in the sense of consistently foregoing safe private payoffs to fund the public good, even when others free-ride or when payoff volatility (from punishment) is high. Their fairness norm is contribution-focused: they keep their own behavior cooperative but do not actively enforce equal contributions on others.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThere is no end-game decay in cooperation: the player maintains full contributions through to the final round, including when at least one peer sharply reduces contribution at the very end. They do not appear to switch to selfish play even when the horizon is very short and reputational or future-return motives are minimized. Their strategy is time-invariant; either they do not put weight on backward induction logic, or they prioritize a fixed cooperative principle over payoff-maximizing end-game adjustment. They also do not ramp up or change use of reward or punishment as the end approaches; sanction behavior stays minimal and sporadic, suggesting limited strategic horizon-based planning overall.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThe player never uses punishment, despite multiple opportunities and clear evidence of persistent low contributors and disruptive actors. They refrain from punishing both clear under-contributors and potential norm violators, even when punishment by others is frequent and severe. This indicates a strong reluctance to engage in costly harm, even when it could be economically effective and socially supported. Their motive structure appears non-retaliatory and non-deterrent: they do not use punishment to discipline, to even scores, or to respond to personal disadvantage. This is consistent with a prosocial but non-enforcing “cooperative pacifist” type: willing to contribute heavily to the common good but unwilling to incur costs to inflict losses on others, regardless of group norms or efficiency arguments.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nThe player is never punished in this game; thus there is no direct evidence of how they respond to identifiable punishers. Their standing as a consistent full contributor makes them an unlikely target for norm-enforcing punishment, and indeed no one directs punishment at them. As a result, their tendencies regarding forgiveness, retaliation, or conforming in response to being punished are unknown. Given their general avoidance of punishment toward others, a cautious inference (low confidence) is that they may be disinclined to retaliate even if punished, but this is not behaviorally tested here.\n\n<REWARD>\nThe player uses reward sparingly but deliberately. They reward only a few times across the game and always choose clear high contributors or especially cooperative peers. They never reward low or erratic contributors, even when those players are heavily targeted by others. Reward choices suggest an attempt to positively reinforce strong cooperation, possibly to acknowledge consistent contributors or to encourage an emerging cooperative cluster. However, they do not escalate into systematic “bonus” payments or broad mutual-reward cycles; they remain highly selective and low-intensity in reward use. This pattern is consistent with a frugal prosocial type: willing to spend a little to reinforce good behavior but not to run an expensive reward regime. There is no sign they use reward tactically to buy allies or to offset others’ punishment; the targets are already prosocial by contribution behavior.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThe player receives rewards from others on several occasions and continues to contribute fully before and after being rewarded. They do not appear to change their sanction behavior—neither to reciprocally reward their benefactors nor to form a visible “reward club.” They also do not start punishing on behalf of those who reward them. Their contribution pattern is already maximally cooperative, so there is no upward shift to observe; the main effect is that their behavior remains unchanged. This suggests that their cooperation is driven more by internal norms or stable preferences than by direct reciprocity to specific rewarders. Any reciprocity or alliance-building motive, if present, is subtle or overshadowed by their fixed strategy; explicit reciprocal reward to particular individuals is not clearly expressed.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThe player shows awareness of others’ outcomes (since they see all payoffs and sanction flows) but does not visibly react in their own strategy. They observe repeated, sometimes harsh punishment patterns, including concentrated punishment of certain low contributors and extensive sanction spending by some high contributors. Despite this, they neither join in punishment nor adjust contributions in response to changing payoff landscapes, inequities, or the emergence of punitive “enforcers.” Likewise, when some peers suffer large net losses or negative payoffs from being heavily punished, the player does not step in to counterbalance with rewards. Their behavior indicates a separation between their own prosocial norm (always contribute fully, occasionally reward cooperative peers) and the broader payoff dynamics. They seem indifferent, in strategic terms, to others’ exact payoffs, focusing instead on sustaining their own cooperative pattern and occasionally signaling approval of high contributors, without engaging in payoff-level correction or coalition behavior. Overall, they are a principled, non-interventionist cooperator who watches but does not strategically exploit or repair the sanction structure around them."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a consistently above-average cooperator who mixes moderate and high contributions with occasional small downward adjustments. They rarely free-ride and never choose the minimum; their typical choice lies somewhat above the group mean. They appear guided by a fairness norm that expects roughly mid-to-high contributions from everyone and treats very low contributors as norm violators. Their contribution level is relatively stable over time, with minor fluctuations that do not show sharp decay, even after being targeted by punishment. They do not strongly condition their contributions on short-term personal payoff changes; instead, they maintain a cooperative baseline and tweak around it. Risk tolerance appears moderate: they are willing to fully cooperate at times even after being punished, suggesting they accept short-term vulnerability to sustain the public good, but they also occasionally lower their contribution, indicating some sensitivity to being exploited.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThey show no substantial end-game collapse in contributions. Even in the final rounds, they maintain moderate contributions rather than dropping to zero or to clear free-riding levels. They continue to use punishment actively in the final round, including toward a sudden low contributor, indicating that they remain norm-enforcing rather than switching to purely self-maximizing play. Horizon awareness is present in that their pattern of targeting appears refined and consistent by the late game, but they do not relax their standards or “cash out” in contribution or in sanctioning. This suggests a type that treats norm enforcement and cooperation as intrinsic or habit-like, not something to abandon once future interaction is limited.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey are a heavy and systematic punisher who focuses almost exclusively on low contributors and clear deviations from their internal standard. They use punishment frequently and at nontrivial personal cost, often targeting the same low-contribution individuals across multiple rounds. They also punish occasional moderate deviations when these are notably below the emerging group norm or below what they themselves give. High contributors are never punished by them, and they do not appear to use punishment competitively or retaliatorily; their targets are consistently those who contribute clearly less than the majority. This pattern aligns with strong altruistic norm enforcement: they bear significant costs to reduce the payoffs of under-contributors and to signal a minimum acceptable cooperation level. They do not appear to use punishment strategically to influence rewards or to form coalitions; it is primarily corrective and deterrent, aimed at enforcing a fairness norm on contributions.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nWhen they are punished, they show no evidence of retaliation, even when the punishment costs them and the punisher is identifiable. Their subsequent behavior does not include counter-punishing those who punished them, nor do they reduce their contributions in a clear act of defiance. Instead, they either maintain or even raise their contribution levels afterward. This indicates a forgiving or at least non-retaliatory disposition: they do not use sanctioning to fight back or engage in vendettas. There is also no clear sign that they strategically appease punishers by altering whom they sanction; their punishment focus remains on low contributors. Overall, they treat being punished as separate from their own norm-enforcing agenda, and they continue to apply their standards regardless of who targeted them.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey effectively never reward, despite many opportunities and despite the presence of numerous consistently high contributors. This is not due to lack of information but appears to be a principled or preference-based choice. Given that the reward mechanism is relatively inefficient compared to punishment, one plausible interpretation is that they prioritize cost-effective norm enforcement and view punishment as the primary tool, while considering rewards as unnecessary or wasteful. They do not appear to use rewards strategically to build alliances or reinforce high cooperation; instead, they rely solely on punishment to shape behavior. This marks them as a “pure sanctioning” type: they are willing to pay to reduce defectors’ payoffs, but not to subsidize cooperators.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThey are occasionally rewarded by others but never visibly change their subsequent behavior to favor those rewarders, either through reciprocal rewards or through selective leniency in punishment. There is no sign that they respond to being rewarded with alliance-building or gratitude-based reciprocity. Their contribution levels remain within their usual band and their punishment targets continue to be determined by contribution levels rather than by prior help received. This suggests that they are relatively insensitive to positive incentives in social terms: they neither seek nor reciprocate reward, maintaining a rule-based approach centered on contribution norms rather than on interpersonal exchange.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey pay close attention to others’ contribution levels and, implicitly, to resulting payoffs, but they do not appear swayed by who is currently rich or poor; their reactions track cooperation rather than earnings. Players who repeatedly contribute low are repeatedly sanctioned by them, even when those players are already being heavily punished by others, suggesting a desire to reinforce the social signal rather than to optimize marginal deterrence alone. They do not punish high earners if those earnings arise from high contributions, implying no envy-based behavior. Conversely, they do not reward high contributors even when those contributors earn strong payoffs, indicating that outcome admiration does not translate into positive transfers. They are also not evidently reacting to others’ punishment or reward expenditures by adjusting their own; they remain focused on their own norm standard rather than coordinating on a shared punishment strategy. Overall, they behave like an independently motivated, contribution-focused enforcer: others’ outcomes matter to them mainly insofar as they reveal who is under-contributing relative to the group norm."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a stable, unconditional high contributor. They always contribute the full endowment, regardless of others’ past or current behavior, even when surrounded by persistent free-riding or low contribution from specific individuals and even at the very end of the game. This suggests a strong internal norm for full cooperation that is not contingent on immediate reciprocity. They appear comfortable accepting personal payoff losses from this stance, prioritizing the social optimum and norm consistency over short-term individual gain. Risk tolerance for being exploited is high; they do not reduce contributions in response to visible non-cooperation, instead relying on punishment rather than contribution adjustment to manage norm violations. Fairness, in their contribution choices, is defined as “everyone should contribute maximally” rather than proportionally to others’ actual behavior.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThere is no observable end-game decay in their cooperation: they continue to contribute fully in the final round, despite knowing the game is about to end and despite persistent low contributions by certain players. At the same time, they escalate punitive intensity against chronic low contributors toward the end, even when monetary deterrence value is minimal due to the short remaining horizon. This pattern indicates horizon awareness but a priority on enforcing norms and expressing disapproval over maximizing final monetary payoff. Their end-game response is characterized by stable cooperation plus intensified norm enforcement, not by strategic defection.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey are a frequent, heavy, and targeted punisher. They consistently direct punishment toward those contributing substantially below their own full-contribution norm, with particular focus on chronic or extreme free-riders. They also punish repeated moderate under-contribution, treating it as a meaningful violation even when the rest of the group mostly cooperates. The size of sanctions is often large, sometimes very costly to themselves, which suggests strong willingness to incur personal cost to discipline perceived defectors. Their punishment appears primarily norm-enforcing and deterrent, not retaliatory: they do not target high contributors, and there is no evidence they punish in response to being personally punished (they are never punished). They also never use reward, despite having the option, indicating that their cooperative norm is enforced mainly through negative sanctions rather than positive reinforcement. Their punishment selectivity is high—only those below a high contribution benchmark are targeted—but within that target set they are willing to escalate sharply, including at the very end of the game when future behavioral change is unlikely. This pattern is consistent with strong negative reciprocity and a preference for “moralistic” enforcement, where wrongdoers should suffer even if it does not improve future outcomes.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nUnknown. In this interaction, no one ever punishes them, so there is no behavioral evidence on how they respond to being sanctioned, whether they would retaliate, comply by increasing contributions, or forgive.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey never reward any other player, even when others contribute fully and even when some players spend substantial amounts punishing defectors in a way that aligns with their own norm. This absence persists throughout, despite many opportunities to provide positive reinforcement. Given this, their cooperative enforcement style is one-sidedly punitive rather than balanced between reward and punishment. Their unwillingness to reward may partly reflect the low efficiency of the reward mechanism relative to punishment, but they do not appear to use reward even strategically to build alliances or encourage already-cooperative behavior. For this player, good behavior seems expected and not something that merits extra payoff; only deviations provoke costly action.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThey are rewarded occasionally by others but do not reciprocate with rewards or alter contribution behavior in response. Since they are already at maximum contribution throughout, there is no upward behavioral shift possible, but they also do not reciprocate with reward to those who rewarded them. This indicates that being rewarded does not change their enforcement strategy; they remain purely punitive and do not transition into a mutual-reward or alliance-building mode. Their reaction to being rewarded is behaviorally neutral: they maintain full cooperation and continue to focus exclusively on punishing under-contributors.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey pay close attention to others’ contribution levels and outcomes and seem especially responsive to persistent low contributions irrespective of the punished players’ final payoffs. They are willing to impose punishment that drives some players’ payoffs extremely low or negative, indicating low concern for the punished players’ welfare once they are classified as defectors. There is no evidence they soften sanctions when others have already been heavily punished by third parties in the same round; they add their own punishment on top, suggesting they value norm expression and personal enforcement over efficiency or proportionality to total sanctions received. Conversely, they ignore opportunities to reward high-contributing players or heavy punishers, showing little interest in compensating for others’ sanction costs or evening out final payoffs among cooperators. Overall, they respond to others’ outcomes primarily through the lens of norm compliance: low contributors are aggressively sanctioned regardless of how hard others also hit them; high contributors and punishers of defectors are left to enjoy or bear their outcomes without further intervention."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a stable, unconditional full cooperator. They always contribute their entire endowment, without adjusting to variations in others’ contributions or to shifting punishment patterns around them. Their behavior suggests a strong fairness or efficiency norm: the public project is treated as the default rightful destination of all available resources, regardless of personal payoff consequences. They do not appear risk‑averse in the narrow monetary sense; they accept systematically lower individual payoffs than they could obtain by contributing less, even when free riding is persistent and heavily sanctioned. There is no evidence that they condition their contribution on others’ past behavior, nor that they strategically reduce contributions in response to exploitation or to end‑game proximity. Their cooperative stance appears principled rather than instrumentally optimized.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nAwareness of the finite horizon does not reduce their cooperation; they maintain maximal contributions through to the final round. Rather than displaying standard end‑game decay, they escalate costly punishment of low contributors at the very end, indicating that the horizon either does not weaken their norm enforcement motives or even strengthens a desire to “settle accounts.” They do not appear to be optimizing final‑round monetary payoff; instead, they prioritize enforcing contribution norms and expressing disapproval of free riding when there is no future opportunity for behavioral change. This points to a type that is relatively insensitive to future‑oriented strategic incentives and more driven by deontological or expressive motives.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey are a frequent and heavy punisher, willing to spend large amounts of their own payoff to impose large deductions on specific targets. Punishment is strongly contribution‑based and asymmetric: they consistently sanction the pure free rider and, to a lesser but still substantial extent, a persistent low contributor who gives below the prevailing cooperative standard. They do not punish high contributors or average‑to‑high cooperators, even when those players also punish others, which suggests their punishment is not retaliatory but norm‑enforcing. They show selectivity: only distinct under‑contributors are targeted, with intensity roughly tracking deviation from what appears to be their internal “full or near‑full contribution” standard. Over time, despite under‑contributors not clearly changing their pattern in a sustained way, they continue—and at the end increase—the intensity of sanctions, which indicates that deterrence is not their sole motive. Punishment also serves an expressive or retributive function: they act to equalize or morally rebalance outcomes even when it is inefficient and when learning opportunities for others are nearly over. They never use “mild” punishment as a calibrated signal; instead, they readily escalate to high levels, especially against a habitual free rider, signaling low tolerance for norm violations and a willingness to incur high cost for enforcement.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nNo one ever punishes this player, so their direct response to being punished is unknown. Because punishers are identifiable and they consistently refrain from punishing other high contributors—even those who themselves punish others—it is plausible (but uncertain) that they would not engage in retaliatory punishment simply for being sanctioned; their pattern is focused on contribution levels rather than on who punishes whom. However, this remains speculative; actual behavior under personal sanction is not observed.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey never reward anyone, despite the presence of consistently high contributors who match their cooperative effort. This is not because they lack opportunities or candidates; instead, the pattern indicates a strong asymmetry between punishment and reward. They appear to assign primary responsibility for maintaining cooperation to negative sanctions rather than positive reinforcement. The relatively low “leverage” of rewards compared to punishment may contribute to this choice, but they also ignore opportunities to provide even symbolic or low‑cost rewards. This suggests that they are a “pure punishing cooperator”: they cooperate fully and enforce cooperation through costly punishment, but do not use or apparently value material gratitude or positive reciprocity tools within the game.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThey are never rewarded, so their behavioral response to receiving identifiable rewards is unknown. There is no evidence on whether they would reciprocate rewards, form alliances, or shift punishment/reward strategies in response to being positively recognized.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey pay close attention to others’ contributions and adjust punishment targets accordingly, but they do not soften sanctions based on how badly targets have already been punished by others. Even when a low contributor is already incurring large deductions and ending rounds with very low or negative net payoffs, this player continues or escalates sanctions rather than moderating them. This indicates relatively low concern for the marginal suffering or disadvantage of under‑contributors once they are categorized as norm violators. Conversely, they show implicit solidarity with high contributors: they never punish them despite the fact that these players sometimes incur costs to punish others. They do not mirror others’ punishment patterns; instead, they maintain their own enforcement rule centered on contribution levels. Overall, they track outcomes mainly as a means to identify and repeatedly target free riders and under‑contributors, not to equalize everyone’s final payoffs or to coordinate with other punishers."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a very high, near-unconditional cooperator. Their default is to contribute the full endowment and they maintain this behavior almost the entire game. They briefly experiment with free-riding exactly once, then immediately revert to full contributions and do not repeat the deviation, even when others contribute modestly or very little.\n\nTheir contribution pattern is extremely stable: they do not gradually drift downward over time, nor do they fine-tune contributions in response to small fluctuations in group behavior. Instead, they appear to adopt a simple, robust rule—“always contribute the maximum”—and stick with it.\n\nThe one zero-contribution instance suggests they understand the incentives and are capable of strategic deviation. However, since they promptly return to full giving, the dominant driver seems to be a strong cooperative or efficiency-oriented norm rather than profit-maximizing self-interest. They behave as if they prioritize the group’s total payoff and are comfortable bearing the cost of contributing even when others free-ride.\n\nThey do not condition their behavior much on others’ average contributions: they continue to give maximally when others’ contributions are both high and low. This indicates low responsiveness to short-term fairness violations and a high tolerance for free-riding around them. Their fairness norm appears to be “I do my part regardless,” rather than “I match what others do.”\n\nRisk tolerance toward exploitation is high: they repeatedly expose themselves to being taken advantage of by low contributors and do not self-protect by reducing their own giving. They act as if the moral or strategic value they place on maintaining cooperation outweighs concerns about being treated unfairly.\n\nBelief-wise, they likely infer that contributions are socially desirable and that enough others will contribute that their own giving is worthwhile, even if not everyone cooperates. Their persistence in giving suggests either optimism about group cooperation or a commitment to contributing even without such optimism (which is indistinguishable from behavior alone; confidence: low on motive).\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nDespite full knowledge of the finite horizon, this player does not display a classic end-game decay in cooperation. They sustain maximal contributions through the final phase, including the last few rounds and the very last decision, with no observable reduction.\n\nThere is no evidence that remaining-round information changes their strategy: they do not ramp up free-riding near the end, nor do they escalate contributions (they are already at ceiling most of the time). Awareness of the game’s approaching end therefore either does not factor into their decision rule, or is consciously overridden by a stable norm to keep contributing fully.\n\nIn the final rounds, even when others’ contributions are mixed or relatively low, they continue to contribute the maximum. This suggests they do not attempt to “cash out” at the end by exploiting the group once future reciprocity is impossible. Instead, their behavior is time-invariant: they cooperate in early, middle, and late stages in essentially the same way.\n\nOverall, their horizon awareness appears behaviorally irrelevant; they act like a rule-following, norm-driven cooperator who does not strategically adjust for the end-game."

Their behavior does not depend on variation in others’ actions, because everyone else also always contributes fully. As a result, their cooperative strategy appears stable rather than reactive or exploratory.\n\nThey accept the individual economic risk implied by contributing everything to the public pool, even though the marginal per-capita return of a single contribution is below 1. This suggests a willingness to prioritize group efficiency and equal outcomes over narrow self-interest, at least in environments where cooperation is already universal.\n\nThere is no indication of strategic experimentation, opportunistic free-riding, or mixed strategies. They display a simple, rule-like pattern: always cooperate fully. Whether this reflects a moral norm (“one should contribute”), an expectation that everyone will contribute, or a misunderstanding of incentives is unknown. However, the absence of any deviation across decisions suggests that once this pattern is set, they do not revise it.\n\nTheir fairness norm appears strongly egalitarian: by matching the group’s contribution level and maintaining it, they sustain equal payoffs across all players. They do not attempt to gain even a small advantage when doing so would be easy, indicating low inclination toward exploitative behavior in this context.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThis player shows no end-game decline in cooperation. Their contribution pattern remains identical even when the final decision approaches, despite clear visibility of the remaining number of rounds. They do not attempt to capitalize on the final opportunity to free-ride, even though this would be strategically safe in a one-shot final interaction with no punishment or reward.\n\nThis lack of end-game adjustment suggests at least one of the following, though the precise motive is unknown: (a) they follow a fixed cooperative rule that does not incorporate horizon effects; (b) they place weight on consistency or identity (“I am the kind of player who cooperates”), regardless of temporal position; or (c) they do not reason strategically about the final-round incentives. Which of these is actually operative is unknown.\n\nIn summary, they are horizon-insensitive in this setting: awareness of the game’s finite length does not alter their behavior.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThis player repeatedly observes that all others also contribute fully and that everyone earns identical payoffs. They never witness defection, unequal outcomes, or any need for social control. Their response to this pattern is behavioral stability: they maintain full cooperation and do not test whether they could profit from deviating.\n\nFrom this, it is reasonable to infer that they are at least comfortable with, and possibly positively oriented toward, uniform cooperation and equal payoffs. They neither attempt to outperform others nor react against equality by reducing their contributions. There is no evidence of envy, competitive drive, or retaliatory tendencies in this environment.\n\nBecause punishment and reward are unavailable and never invoked, their stance toward sanctioning or rewarding others’ behavior remains unknown. Likewise, their internal emotional or evaluative reactions to others’ actions (trust, gratitude, obligation) cannot be directly inferred; the only visible response is continued alignment with the group’s cooperative norm."

Across all observed decisions, they always allocate their entire endowment to the public fund, showing no adjustment in response to others’ varying contributions or to changes in their own relative payoff. Their cooperation is highly stable: they do not escalate, retreat, or experiment; they simply maintain maximum contribution. This suggests that they either hold a strong internal norm of contributing fully or follow a simple rule that does not condition on peer behavior.\n\nThey accept substantial payoff disadvantages relative to persistent free riders without altering their behavior, indicating low sensitivity to payoff inequality and a willingness to be exploited rather than defect. This pattern implies relatively low payoff-risk aversion at the individual level: they consistently sacrifice secure private returns to support the group outcome, even when it is clear that many others do not do the same. They appear to prioritize the social efficiency of full contribution (given a high multiplier) over their own relative earnings.\n\nThe player does not display conditional cooperation in the usual sense. Their contributions do not track the average contribution level of the group, nor do they reward cooperative peers or punish defectors via their own contribution decisions. Instead, they behave as a steadfast cooperator: once they commit to full contribution, they maintain it, regardless of changing group composition of contributors and non-contributors. Any fairness norms they may hold are not enforced through contribution withdrawal; they tolerate others taking higher private payoffs while they continue to invest for the group.\n\nBecause the choice set is restricted to all-or-nothing, it is unknown whether they would fine-tune contributions in more granular environments or use more nuanced reciprocity. From the available evidence, the clearest characterization is a principled, non-conditional cooperator who accepts being taken advantage of rather than deviating from a cooperative rule.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThe player observes that free riders consistently earn higher payoffs than contributors in many situations, yet they do not alter their own behavior in response. This indicates that, in practice, they do not retaliate, compensate, or otherwise react strategically to others’ payoff outcomes. They show no evidence of behavioral response to the presence of systematic exploitation: no drift toward self-protection, no apparent attempt to match others’ low contributions, and no visible concern with equalizing payoffs.\n\nBecause explicit punishment and reward mechanisms are disabled, there is no direct evidence of how they would spend resources to change others’ payoffs if given the option. However, their continued willingness to accept disadvantage while still cooperating is consistent with a low tendency to engage in payoff-targeted responses, whether punitive or rewarding; they appear not to condition their actions on who gains or loses in prior periods.\n\nThey also do not appear to selectively support high contributors versus low contributors through their own behavior; everyone benefits equally from their full contributions, regardless of past actions. This suggests that, if they form judgments about others, those judgments do not translate into differentiated treatment within the constraints of this game. Their implicit stance can be summarized as: maintain cooperation independent of others’ outcomes, even when those outcomes are clearly unequal and sometimes unfavorable to themselves. Their emotional or cognitive reactions to these inequalities are unknown; only the behavioral side—robust non-response in terms of strategic adjustment—is evident."

Their strategy is stable and non-contingent: they do not appear to condition contributions on others’ behavior, average group contribution, or relative payoffs. They sustain full cooperation even when it is clearly disadvantageous in individual payoff terms and when others frequently take the selfish option. This indicates a strong internal rule or norm (“I contribute fully”) rather than a responsive, payoff-maximizing calculus. There is no visible experimentation, no shift toward self-protection, and no attempt to match or mirror the majority. Fairness concerns, if present, do not translate into reduced giving; they tolerate being on the losing side of payoff comparisons without altering their action. Risk tolerance appears high with respect to exploitation risk: they persist with a contribution choice that repeatedly leaves them financially vulnerable to defectors. Because contribution is invariant across time and social conditions, their behavior is best described as principled or rule-based cooperation rather than conditional cooperation or strategic reciprocity.

Because punishment and reward tools are unavailable, there is no direct evidence of how they would spend resources to influence others; however, their unchanged full cooperation in the face of repeated exploitation suggests low propensity for payoff-based retaliation and high tolerance for inequality when it arises from others’ selfishness. They do not engage in payoff matching: others’ advantage does not induce them to reduce their own contribution to restore parity. This implies that observing others’ outcomes influences them weakly, if at all, in terms of strategic adjustment. Their likely belief is that it is appropriate to maintain their cooperative stance independent of what others earn, or that changing behavior in response to others’ higher payoffs is not desirable. They exhibit no sign of conditional kindness (rewarding high contributors by increasing their own contributions) or conditional spite (reducing cooperation when facing free riders); instead, they follow a fixed cooperative rule that is robust to seeing both fair and unfair payoff distributions. Overall, they present as a steadfast, non-retaliatory cooperator whose behavior is largely insensitive to observed payoff patterns of others."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a strict, unwavering full cooperator. They always contribute the maximum possible amount in every round, with no experimentation, no retaliation, and no opportunistic defection, even when several others free‑ride or when contributions drop. Their strategy is simple and rigid: “contribute max regardless of what others do.” This indicates strong internalization of the “efficiency” or “do the right thing” norm, and/or low sensitivity to exploitation risk. They do not visibly condition their contributions on past group behavior, on individual free‑riders, or on end‑game proximity. Fairness concerns toward themselves appear secondary to maintaining maximal social efficiency. Risk tolerance is high in the sense that they accept being exploited by defectors without adjusting behavior.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThey communicate very little and only once, briefly acknowledging confusion about the rules after others have said the same. They do not initiate coordination, do not scold defectors, and do not reinforce cooperators verbally. Their tone is neutral and self‑effacing rather than directive or moralizing. They engage minimally in the social chat despite being in a highly communicative group. This suggests a low‑visibility, low‑involvement communication style: they follow the emerging consensus and behavior pattern but do not try to shape it. Responsiveness is present but weak; they respond to the topic at hand (understanding the rules) but do not pursue further clarification or strategic discussion. Overall, they are a quiet cooperator who lets actions, not words, express their stance.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThey show no detectable end‑game effect. Contributions remain maximal in all late rounds, including the final one, even when another player defects at the very end. They do not shift to more self‑interested behavior as the horizon approaches, nor do they escalate cooperation further; they simply maintain their existing pattern. This implies either a strong rule‑based or values‑based approach (“always contribute fully”) that overrides backward induction, or a lack of strategic adjustment to the time horizon. Any beliefs about others’ likely end‑game defection are unknown; behaviorally, they act as if the horizon does not matter.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey never spend any resources on rewarding others, despite being repeatedly rewarded themselves and despite a clearly cooperative group. Across stable full‑cooperation phases, they continue to use zero reward. This consistent abstention suggests that they do not see rewarding as necessary or profitable, even for sustaining cooperation that benefits them. It also suggests a preference for conserving private payoffs once contributions are made: they are willing to sacrifice via contribution, but not via an additional, voluntary reward cost. They do not engage in strategic reinforcement or “tipping” behavior toward high cooperators or generous rewarders. Whether this is due to principled frugality (“I’ve already done my part by contributing max”), confusion, or indifference to reward mechanisms is unknown, but the pattern is stable.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThey receive frequent reward from others but never reciprocate via the reward mechanism. There is no observable attempt to form reward alliances or to “thank” others materially, even when one player sends large amounts of reward to the group over many rounds. They also do not verbally acknowledge or praise rewarders. This implies a non‑reciprocal stance with respect to the reward channel: they are a pure beneficiary there, not an active participant. Their lack of response may reflect a belief that the core cooperative act is contributing to the public good, and that rewards are extraneous; or it may reflect simple inattention to who is rewarding whom. In either case, they do not adjust their reward behavior in response to being rewarded.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey show no explicit reactions—positive or negative—to others’ payoffs, contribution choices, or reward expenditures. They do not call out high payoffs of free‑riders, do not comment on generous reward givers, and do not reference others’ outcomes when explaining or justifying their own play (they never do so at all). Their contribution pattern also suggests outcome‑insensitivity: they continue to play maximally cooperative despite periodic exploitation and despite visible variation in others’ payoffs due to reward. They appear neither vengeful nor particularly grateful in behavioral terms; others’ outcomes do not alter their strategy. This points to a type that cooperates unconditionally and largely ignores the detailed distribution of gains and costs within the group."

They do not display sensitivity to fairness in their own contribution choice (no retaliation, no conditional cooperation), suggesting a “principled cooperator” or efficiency‑oriented type rather than a conditional cooperator.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nTheir communication is sparse, direct, and goal‑oriented. They greet others briefly, then use chat mainly to coordinate around full cooperation and to encourage a specific contribution level that maximizes group returns. They explicitly advocate everyone contributing the maximum, indicating they understand and try to influence the social optimum. When free‑riding becomes visible, they call out the noncontributor in a light, non-hostile way, signaling disapproval but not aggression. Overall tone is cooperative and mildly assertive: they try to steer group behavior, but they do not argue, moralize at length, or escalate conflict.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThey do not exhibit classic end‑game defection or decay in cooperation despite knowing the horizon is short and approaching. Their contribution pattern is stable and fully cooperative through the final decision, indicating that their strategy is not driven by backward induction or short-term exploitation. They continue to advocate high contributions even when there is no future round in which reputation could pay off, consistent with a stable intrinsic preference for cooperation or group efficiency rather than strategic reputation-building.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey can see that some players earn more by contributing less or nothing, yet they maintain full cooperation. Their only visible reaction is a brief social nudge directed at a persistent noncontributor, which suggests they notice and care about others’ behavior and outcomes, but they do not respond with withdrawal of cooperation or overt hostility. They use social pressure (“come on”) rather than threats or moral condemnation, suggesting a preference for gentle norm enforcement over punishment. There is no evidence they track individual payoffs in detail or adjust behavior based on who benefits most; they appear more focused on promoting the cooperative norm than on correcting payoff inequalities."

There is no sign they are targeting fairness in the sense of matching others’ average; instead they tolerate being more generous than many peers without reacting.

Whether this is driven by altruism, efficiency concerns, or misunderstanding of the payoff structure is unknown.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThe player’s communication is minimal, friendly, and non-directive. They participate in the social atmosphere with a brief, upbeat greeting but do not attempt to coordinate contribution levels, persuade others, or comment on cooperation and free-riding. They neither support nor challenge the emerging coalition that discusses putting in high amounts, nor do they join the later moral or political framing of others’ behavior. Their style is broadly affiliative but low-engagement: they signal presence and goodwill but avoid conflict, pressure, or moralizing. They do not single out anyone, including clear free-riders, and refrain from shaming, blaming, or instructing, suggesting a preference for low-friction interaction over active norm enforcement.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nDespite the short horizon and clear knowledge of the final round, the player shows no end-game decay in cooperation. They maintain full contribution through to the end, even as others reduce their contributions and some players consistently free-ride. This indicates that they either (a) do not use backward-induction style reasoning in this context, (b) prioritize normative or efficiency goals over final-round self-interest, or (c) choose a simple, fixed strategy they do not reconsider with the approaching end. There is no hint of strategic “last-round defection” or even partial self-protection; awareness of the game length does not translate into opportunistic adjustment.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThe player does not comment on or visibly react to others’ payoffs or contribution patterns, including clear and persistent free-riding.

This suggests a type that either (a) prioritizes norm-consistent full cooperation as a rule, or (b) treats the discrete choice environment as a simple “always cooperate” problem.\n\nFairness norms appear oriented toward collective efficiency rather than strict reciprocity: the player tolerates the presence of clear free-riders and mixed contributors without changing behavior.

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is primarily a free-rider with occasional, short-lived switches to full contribution. Their baseline is to keep their entire endowment and live off others’ contributions, even when most others contribute. They only ever use the extreme options available (all or nothing) and show no gradual adjustment, suggesting simple heuristic play rather than fine-tuned optimization. Full contributions appear sporadically and do not persist even when others also contribute a lot, indicating that they do not strongly internalize a cooperative norm or aim for stable reciprocity. They tolerate benefiting from others’ generosity without matching it and do not appear concerned with aligning their behavior to group averages. Their risk tolerance regarding cooperation is low: when in doubt, they default to defection and prioritize immediate personal payoff over potential collective gain. Any cooperative moves seem exploratory or context-reactive rather than part of a sustained fairness norm. Their fairness preferences are weak or inconsistent: they sometimes join high-contribution environments but do not maintain that stance when it would require sacrificing their own payoff repeatedly.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey make relatively infrequent use of punishment and, when they do punish, it is light and isolated rather than part of a systematic enforcement strategy. There is no clear pattern of punishing low contributors versus high contributors; their punishment choices do not obviously track cooperative norms, defectors, or extreme punishers. They do not appear to engage in costly norm enforcement aimed at stabilizing cooperation, nor do they join group-wide punishment cascades. Their spending on punishment is modest overall, consistent with a preference to preserve their own payoffs rather than invest heavily in shaping others’ behavior. Motivationally, the limited and sporadic punishment suggests either mild expressive reactions (e.g., annoyance at being targeted or at seeming unfairness) or experimentation with the mechanism rather than deliberate deterrence. They are not vengeful in any obvious, sustained way and do not escalate punishment in response to others’ aggression. Selectivity and targeting rules are unclear (low-confidence: unknown); there is no strong evidence they systematically reward cooperators or sanction free-riders via punishment choices.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nThey experience substantial punishment across the game but do not clearly retaliate against specific identified punishers, nor do they shift toward stable cooperation to appease them. When punished, their subsequent contributions generally remain low or revert to defection after brief cooperative excursions, suggesting limited compliance with punitive pressure. There is no consistent pattern of “hit back at whoever punished me” visible; their rare uses of punishment do not line up clearly with those who previously targeted them, at least at the coarse resolution available here. This indicates a relatively low retaliatory drive, or at least low willingness to spend on revenge. At the same time, they also do not respond with durable “forgiveness-and-cooperation” after being sanctioned; their cooperative switches are temporary and do not map cleanly onto punishments received, so any appeasement motive is weak or absent. Overall, they appear behaviorally resistant to social control via punishment: they absorb deductions and continue to prioritize self-benefit, with only short, inconsistent deviations toward cooperation.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey observe others repeatedly spending heavily on punishment and sometimes driving their own or others’ payoffs negative, yet they do not join these extremes. This suggests they notice but do not imitate costly moralistic or spiteful behavior. They seem content to let others bear the cost of enforcing or attacking, while they maintain a relatively payoff-protective stance. Very high punishment expenditures by others do not trigger a clear change in their own contribution level; they neither become significantly more cooperative to avoid becoming a target nor start punishing in solidarity with other punishers. Likewise, they do not clearly favor or protect consistent cooperators; they neither reward nor materially defend those who contribute a lot or suffer high deductions. Their reaction to others’ payoffs and punishment patterns is largely passive: they adapt contributions only weakly and remain focused on individual gain rather than on shaping group outcomes. Their beliefs about others (inferred from behavior) likely include the expectation that others will keep contributing or keep punishing each other regardless of the focal player’s own actions, leading them to treat the social environment as something to exploit rather than something to stabilize."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a conditional, moderately cooperative contributor who mixes full contributions with clear episodes of free-riding. They are comfortable both fully cooperating and fully defecting, and they switch modes multiple times rather than following a simple increasing or decreasing pattern. Their default in many situations is to contribute fully, but they are willing to withhold contributions even when others are generally cooperative, suggesting that maximizing own payoff and testing others’ willingness to carry the public good are both salient.\n\nThey appear sensitive to group behavior but not in a strict “mirror” way. They sometimes cooperate when several others are low or zero, and sometimes free-ride when most others are high. This suggests they track the general climate but do not tie their own action mechanically to any single fairness benchmark. There is no evidence of a strong equal-contribution norm; they tolerate persistent low contributors and do not systematically retaliate by dropping to zero every time others underprovide.\n\nThey accept payoff risk to cooperate: they frequently put their entire endowment into the public good even when it is clear that some players are chronic non-contributors. At the same time, they also demonstrate opportunistic behavior: at several points they keep their entire endowment while others sustain relatively high contribution levels, allowing them to earn very high payoffs. This pattern is consistent with a “conditional opportunist” who is neither a pure altruist nor a pure free-rider.\n\nOver time, their contribution pattern is volatile rather than smoothly trending. They oscillate between full and zero contributions across early, middle, and late phases, indicating ongoing experimentation or context-dependent decision rules rather than a fixed strategy. They appear comfortable with strategic inconsistency if it offers occasional high payoffs or information about others’ responses.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThe player shows clear horizon awareness but not a simple linear end-game defection. They continue to make full contributions well into the late game while others sometimes under-contribute, indicating that they do not shift into a pure “last rounds = always defect” strategy. Near the very end, however, they cluster multiple zero-contribution choices, including in the final round when group cooperation remains strong. This suggests that they recognize the absence of future interactions and are willing to exploit that when there is no longer any reputational or reciprocal benefit to maintaining contributions.\n\nTheir end-game behavior thus reflects a mixed motive: up to the final stretch they still invest in the public good, perhaps to sustain group benefits and maintain incoming rewards, but as the remaining-rounds count becomes very small they prioritize personal payoff and become comfortable free-riding on others’ continued cooperation. They do not escalate cooperation in the final rounds; instead, they allow their opportunistic side to dominate.\n\nBecause they had already received substantial rewards while occasionally defecting earlier, it is plausible (though not certain) that they believe others will keep cooperating and possibly rewarding even if they themselves reduce contributions at the end. Overall, their response to the end-game is best described as “late but not extreme unraveling”: they maintain some cooperation into the late horizon, then pivot to zero contributions once the future is too short for cooperative reinforcement to matter.\n\n<REWARD>\nThe player is generally willing to use the reward mechanism and does so repeatedly across the game. They spend on rewards in both cooperative and non-cooperative rounds, indicating that willingness to reward is not contingent on their own contribution level in that round. They sometimes reward while defecting, which suggests a separation between “how I behave right now” and “how I want to shape or acknowledge others’ behavior.” This points to a strategic or evaluative use of reward rather than purely reciprocal tit-for-tat.\n\nTheir reward behavior appears to be selective rather than indiscriminate. They do not spend on rewards every round, and they modulate the amount they spend. This indicates they are likely targeting players they perceive as especially cooperative or as key to maintaining high group contributions. They seem to accept the personal cost of rewarding as an investment in sustaining or amplifying others’ good behavior, consistent with a forward-looking, group-benefit-oriented use of the mechanism.\n\nThey also continue to reward in situations where their own contributions are low and others’ contributions remain relatively high, consistent with gratitude or an attempt to maintain a profitable cooperative environment while personally taking advantage of it. This is compatible with a “strategic benefactor” profile: they value a high-cooperation group, are willing to pay to support and encourage cooperators, but do not bind themselves to reciprocate via contributions in every period.\n\nOverall, this player’s “type” can be summarized as a conditional cooperator with opportunistic free-riding tendencies and an active, strategically minded use of positive incentives. They seek to preserve a cooperative environment through selective rewarding, while giving themselves flexibility to defect—especially when reputation or future rewards are less at stake, such as near the game’s end. Their social style is thus mixed: they are supportive and reinforcement-oriented toward cooperators, yet comfortable exploiting the public good at times when it appears safe or profitable to do so."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a generally high contributor with moderate volatility and clear responsiveness to group behavior. They often give their full endowment or close to it, especially when others appear cooperative. They occasionally reduce contributions sharply when group contributions seem to have softened or fragmented, then return to higher giving once they infer that cooperation is resurging. This pattern suggests a conditional cooperator: they prefer mutual high contribution but are unwilling to be the only one sustaining it if others drift downward.\n\nThey appear to track others’ average behavior and react to perceived shifts rather than holding a rigid strategy. When others’ contributions are broadly high and relatively homogeneous, they match or exceed that level. When they see more heterogeneity, low individual contributions, or signs that some players are exploiting the group, they cut back but not to zero, indicating both self-protection and a residual commitment to the public good.\n\nThey show moderate risk tolerance. They are willing to invest fully into the public good multiple times without guarantees of reciprocity, suggesting trust in the group and an expectation that high contributions can persist. At the same time, they display some caution by occasionally lowering their own contribution in response to a less cooperative environment instead of blindly continuing to cooperate.\n\nThere is some orientation toward fairness: they appear more comfortable giving a lot when many others also give substantial amounts. They do not respond in a strongly punitive way via their own contribution (for example, they do not drop to pure free-riding even when others clearly do) but they do adjust downward, which can be interpreted as a mild, non-confrontational response to perceived unfairness.\n\nOverall, this is a “conditional high contributor” type: they prefer to contribute generously, anchor around high levels of cooperation, and adjust their behavior up or down based on the group’s apparent cooperative norm.\n\n<REWARD>\nThis player never spends anything on rewarding others despite the positive efficiency of reward. This holds even when others contribute very generously or when particular players repeatedly put in high amounts and visibly sustain the group’s earnings. The player does, however, accept reward from others when it is given to them; there is no evidence of them trying to reciprocate that kindness through the reward mechanism.\n\nTheir consistent non-use of reward indicates a strong cost-avoidant stance regarding second-order cooperation. They are willing to contribute directly to the public good but are not willing to incur personal costs to shape others’ behavior via rewards. This suggests they either do not believe that rewarding will effectively change others’ contributions, or they consider the marginal cost to themselves not worth the marginal benefit, even though the mechanism is socially efficient.\n\nThey do not appear to use reward strategically to cultivate alliances or to signal gratitude. Even when someone who has contributed similarly high amounts could be reinforced at low relative cost, this player abstains. This points to a type who relies on direct contribution decisions (their own and others’) as the main coordination device, and who treats the reward mechanism as something to ignore rather than a tool to manage group norms.\n\nIn new environments with similar structures, they are likely to continue contributing generously when others do, but they remain essentially a “non-rewarder”: they leave all norm-enforcement and positive reciprocity through rewards to other group members.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThis player clearly observes others’ outcomes and adapts their own contribution pattern based on the emerging collective behavior, but they do not intervene via rewards or counter-rewards. They see that some players repeatedly spend heavily on rewards (sometimes to their own detriment) and that others free-ride or contribute very little while still enjoying high payoffs. Their reaction is behavioral adjustment in their own contribution, not active governance of others.\n\nWhen they witness high, relatively uniform group contributions and reasonably high payoffs all around, they maintain or return to high contributions themselves, indicating trust in the stability or recoverability of cooperation. When they observe more chaotic or polarized outcomes—some overinvesting in reward, some barely contributing, some earning much more or less than others—they respond with more cautious contributions, weakening their own exposure to exploitation while still participating.\n\nThey show no evidence of emotional reciprocity expressed through the mechanisms available: they do not repay rewards with rewards, do not “thank” high contributors by reinforcing them, and do not seem to punish or counterbalance players whose outcomes are especially extreme. Their stance is observational and adaptive rather than interventionist. They appear to accept that others’ payoff patterns (including extreme losses due to reward overspending or windfalls to low contributors) are part of the game environment, and they manage their own behavior accordingly instead of trying to reshape that environment.\n\nOverall, in response to others’ outcomes, they are a pragmatic observer: they update their expectations about the group’s cooperative norm and tune their own contributions, but refrain from using the available reward technology to correct, encourage, or sanction others."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a low, volatile contributor who occasionally makes brief cooperative surges. Across the game, their typical contribution level is small relative to the endowment and to the group, with multiple minimal or zero contributions interspersed with a few full or high contributions. They do not follow a simple monotonic pattern (neither steady decay nor steady increase); instead, they alternate between free-riding and sizable giving, suggesting experimentation or opportunistic adjustment rather than a fixed norm.\n\nTheir behavior is conditionally responsive to others’ cooperation. After observing very high average contributions and generous use of rewards in the group, they sometimes jump to high contributions, but they do not maintain that level once they have confirmed that they can earn strong payoffs while contributing little. The pattern suggests they understand that contributing little while others give a lot is profitable and are willing to exploit that situation. At the same time, occasional high contributions indicate they are not purely selfish in a static sense; they sometimes act as if testing or reinforcing a cooperative regime, then revert when high cooperation appears stable without their full participation.\n\nThey do not appear to follow a strict fairness norm. They are willing to contribute far less than heavy contributors while still accepting the shared returns from the public pool, and they show no consistent effort to match or proportionally track others’ contributions. This implies limited concern for contribution equality, at least when it trades off with their own earnings.\n\nRisk tolerance in contribution choices appears moderate. They are willing at times to risk the cost of full contribution in a large group with mixed behavior, but because they quickly revert to small contributions even when cooperation is strong, the default seems to be a cautious, payoff-protecting stance: they mostly keep private coins safe and only occasionally stake them on the public good.\n\n<REWARD>\nThis player is a light, selective rewarder who uses rewards sparingly and with no clear pattern of systematic reinforcement. In most rounds, they do not spend anything on rewards. When they do spend, it is always at the minimum nonzero level available and directed at a very small number of recipients. This reveals a reluctance to bear substantial personal cost for shaping others’ behavior.\n\nThey appear more willing to reward when group cooperation is already high or rising and when they themselves have contributed at least something. In those situations, they sometimes spend a bit to reward, which is consistent with a weak form of conditional cooperation: they are willing to pay slightly to acknowledge or support a cooperative environment but not to drive it from scratch. The small, infrequent expenditures suggest they view reward primarily as a minor tweak rather than a central strategic tool.\n\nThere is no consistent evidence that they target either extreme cooperators or specific individuals over time; given anonymity of rewarders, any such targeting cannot be inferred with confidence. Whether they use reward to express gratitude, to encourage particular partners, or simply to “do a small good” is unknown. Overall, they value their own payoff more than the potential future gains from strategic, large-scale rewarding.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThis player closely observes that others frequently contribute much more and often engage in very heavy rewarding, sometimes to the point of significantly lowering their own payoffs. Their own behavior indicates that they do not imitate these extremes. Instead, they continue to play in a comparatively self-protective, low-cost way even when others incur large expenses on rewards.\n\nThey do not ramp up contributions or reward spending in response to other players sacrificing a lot for the group, suggesting limited reciprocity toward high-cost cooperators. At the same time, they also do not retaliate against low contributors (punishment is unavailable) nor respond with increased contributions when apparent “free-riders” are rewarded by others. They simply maintain or return to their preferred low-contribution, low-reward pattern after brief experiments with higher giving.\n\nThis points to a mindset where others’ outcomes serve more as background information than as strong behavioral triggers. They notice the environment is generally cooperative and that some players are willing to spend heavily on rewarding, but they treat this mainly as an opportunity to secure good payoffs with modest personal sacrifice. Their adaptation over time reflects learning about what the group tolerates and what yields high earnings for them, rather than a strong normative response to fairness, altruistic sacrifice, or gratitude. Their social style thus appears pragmatic, mildly conditional, and only weakly influenced by others’ costs or extreme generosity."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a conditional, payoff-sensitive contributor who mixes cooperation and free-riding rather than committing to a single mode. They are clearly willing to contribute fully to the public good at many points, but they also repeatedly choose to contribute nothing even when others continue to contribute. Their pattern shows that they do not follow a simple “always cooperate” norm; instead, they appear to compare the private payoff from free-riding against the shared payoff from joint contribution and are willing to exploit cooperative others when it is lucrative.\n\nTheir contribution behavior is moderately volatile: they switch several times between full contribution and zero contribution across the game instead of settling quickly into a single stable choice. However, they are not random: stretches of sustained full contribution alternate with stretches of sustained free-riding, suggesting they update based on perceived trends in the group or on recent payoff experiences rather than round-by-round emotional reactions.\n\nThey do not enforce strict fairness norms. They continue to contribute in the presence of at least one persistent free-rider and do not systematically withdraw cooperation in direct proportion to others’ selfishness. At the same time, they also free-ride even when multiple others are cooperating, indicating that “if others are fair, I must also be fair” is not a binding rule for them. Instead, their fairness concern is either weak or consistently overridden by payoff considerations.\n\nRisk tolerance appears moderate. They are willing to be the only or one of very few contributors in some rounds, exposing themselves to the risk of low redistribution when others do not join. Yet they also protect themselves at times by switching to free-riding, especially after experiencing scenarios in which contributing yields relatively poor private payoffs compared to free-riding under similar group behavior. This pattern suggests a player who recognizes the strategic risk of unilateral cooperation and is willing to take it sometimes, but not in a rigid or idealistic way.\n\nOverall, their contribution “type” is a flexible, opportunistic cooperator: inclined to cooperate when it seems worthwhile or when others are joining in, but ready to revert to self-interested free-riding to secure high individual payoffs and to avoid bearing the cost of sustaining cooperation alone.\n\n<REWARD>\nThe player never spends any resources on rewarding others, despite having multiple opportunities and despite being paired with clear, observable cooperative behavior from specific group members. This consistent absence of reward behavior suggests that they either assign negligible value to rewarding as an instrument for sustaining cooperation or they strictly prioritize keeping their own payoff over any attempt to shape others’ behavior through positive incentives.\n\nThey do receive rewards from others at several points, but this does not induce them to start rewarding anyone in return. There is no evidence that receiving rewards triggers gratitude-based reciprocation in the reward channel. They do not engage in “strategic reinforcement” of particular partners either; for example, they never select a consistently high-contributing partner to encourage with rewards, even when that partner’s behavior is easily identifiable and potentially valuable to sustain.\n\nGiven that the cost and benefit of reward are symmetric here, their complete abstention from rewarding likely reflects a belief that reward is either ineffective, not worth the effort, or simply dominated by focusing on one’s own contributions and free-riding decisions. They may also view reward as redundant in an environment where contributions are already visible and where they can respond directly by adjusting their own contributions rather than by spending on side-payments.\n\nIn sum, they are a non-rewarder: they do not use the reward option for altruistic, reciprocal, or strategic reasons, and they treat reward as an unnecessary or inefficient instrument in this setting.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nWhen others reward them, the player does not mirror that behavior through direct rewarding, but they do at times change their contribution behavior in ways that are compatible with some degree of responsiveness. After receiving a reward, they sometimes move from free-riding to contributing, or they maintain a cooperative stance for a while. However, they also later revert to free-riding even after having been rewarded multiple times, indicating that any positive response to being rewarded is partial and unstable.\n\nThey do not single out identifiable rewarders for special treatment through contributions. Because all players’ contributions are public, it is possible in principle for them to form an “alliance” with those who both contribute and reward them. Yet their subsequent behavior toward such partners remains mixed: they sometimes cooperate alongside cooperative others, and sometimes exploit them by free-riding, even when those same partners have previously rewarded them. There is no visible pattern of targeted reciprocity toward specific rewarders.\n\nThis suggests that their primary response to being rewarded is not gratitude or alliance-building but, at most, a weak and temporary adjustment in overall cooperation level that is dominated by payoff considerations and by their reading of the wider group pattern. They appear to treat being rewarded as a pleasant but non-binding signal: it may briefly coincide with higher contributions, but it does not anchor long-term loyalty or create a robust reciprocal bond with the rewarder."

They quickly experiment with both full cooperation and full defection and then settle into a pattern of predominantly contributing the entire endowment. They appear willing to keep contributing even when others’ cooperation is unstable or low, suggesting either a prosocial or principled preference for contributing that is not purely outcome-maximizing in the short term.\n\nTheir defection episodes are brief and seem tied to specific informational cues rather than random noise: when others clearly provide the public good alone or in small minority, the player is willing to free-ride while still using the reward mechanism. This indicates they separate the act of contributing from the act of “supporting” contributors; they may see occasional non-contribution as acceptable if they compensate via rewards.\n\nThey do not systematically mirror others’ average contribution level; instead, they are willing to contribute fully even in mixed or low-contribution environments. This suggests relatively low sensitivity to immediate fairness norms and an above-average tolerance for being “the one” who contributes when others do not. At the same time, they are not a pure unconditional cooperator, because they do test non-contribution and revert to it in a few cases when the group provides some public good without them.\n\nOverall, they resemble a “principled cooperator with occasional strategic defection”: default is full contribution, but they remain willing to defect selectively, especially when others are already covering the public good or when cooperation around them breaks down.\n\n<REWARD>\nThe player is willing to spend on rewards, but only rarely and in a clearly selective, targeted manner. They use rewards exclusively when they themselves do not contribute, or when they appear to be reinforcing an already cooperative environment while still shouldering full contributions. This pattern indicates that they employ reward as a tool to acknowledge or incentivize contributors rather than as a routine “tip.”\n\nThey do not use reward symmetrically across all cooperators: their total use is sparse, suggesting they do not see it as necessary to reward every cooperative act. Instead, they likely reserve it for specific moments they interpret as pivotal: either when someone else cooperates while they free-ride, or when they want to strengthen cooperative norms after a period of mixed behavior. They never reward non-contributors, so their standard is contribution-contingent.\n\nBecause the cost and benefit of reward are matched in this game, their sparse use is not driven by payoff inefficiency. This suggests they treat reward as a meaningful social signal rather than a neutral transfer: using it too often might dilute its informational or normative content. They appear more “selective supporter” than “generous patron”: rewards are used as calibrated reinforcement of cooperation, not as general generosity.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nWhen they themselves receive rewards, they continue to contribute and do not obviously shift to heavier rewarding in response. There is no clear evidence of systematic, direct reciprocity toward rewarders; whether this is because the same partners are not uniquely identifiable in the data, or because the player does not adjust to being rewarded, is unknown. They do not visibly pivot into a “rewarding back” strategy after being rewarded, which suggests that gratitude-based repayment is not a dominant motive in their observable behavior.\n\nThey do appear to maintain or resume high contribution after being rewarded, so they are at least compatible with a norm of “reward encourages me to keep cooperating,” but they already tend to cooperate heavily, so the incremental effect is unclear. They neither punish nor reduce contribution in response to perceived lack of reward, suggesting they do not see reward as an entitlement.\n\nIn summary, they are modestly responsive in terms of continuing cooperation but do not clearly engage in alliance-building through reciprocal reward. Their stance toward rewarders is “appreciative but not strategically reciprocating” or, more cautiously, unknown with respect to direct reciprocity beyond sustaining cooperative behavior."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a mixed, conditional contributor who alternates between full cooperation and full free-riding, rather than settling into a single stable pattern. They are clearly willing to contribute the entire endowment and do so repeatedly, which rules out a pure selfish or purely risk-averse type. At the same time, they also repeatedly choose not to contribute even when others are contributing, so they are not a strict unconditional cooperator either.\n\nTheir cooperation appears loosely conditional on the surrounding contribution climate and on their own recent experience, but the condition is not rigid: they sometimes cooperate when others are mostly defecting and sometimes defect when at least one or two others cooperate. This suggests they are not a strict “tit-for-tat” or pure matching type, but rather someone who is experimenting between cooperative and exploitative options to see which pattern yields better returns.\n\nThey seem comfortable with payoff risk: they contribute in situations where it is already evident that at least some group members contribute zero, so they do not require unanimous cooperation before pitching in. They also appear to tolerate inequality to their own disadvantage: they keep contributing after experiencing being the only or one of the few contributors, and they do not systematically withdraw cooperation in all such cases.\n\nNormatively, they seem to hold a weak fairness norm in favor of higher contributions: they repeatedly match or exceed the highest cooperative standard that exists in the group, but they do not maintain that standard consistently or enforce it through their own behavior when others fall short. The resulting pattern is a “wobbly cooperator–opportunist”: willing to support a cooperative regime, but not committed enough to sacrifice payoffs steadily or to fully discipline free-riding through their own choices.\n\nTheir contribution choices do not show clear end-game unraveling; they continue to contribute their full endowment even after many rounds have passed. Since they cannot see how many rounds remain, this persistence is consistent with some present-focused experimentation rather than forward-looking strategic end-game defection.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey almost never spend on reward, despite multiple opportunities and despite being on the receiving end of rewards more than once. The single instance of rewarding behavior is an exception rather than a pattern, which indicates that prosocial reinforcement is not a central part of their strategy.\n\nWhen they do reward, it appears targeted at someone who is clearly cooperating relative to others, suggesting that, in principle, they recognize and are willing to positively reinforce above-baseline cooperation. However, the fact that this rewarding action does not repeat later, even when similarly cooperative peers are present, suggests that the earlier reward is either a one-time experiment with the mechanism or a transient impulse rather than a stable preference.\n\nThe cost and benefit of reward are symmetric in this environment, so the material calculus is neutral: not rewarding does not directly improve their payoff relative to rewarding, except to avoid the transaction altogether. Their near-complete avoidance of reward therefore looks more like a preference to minimize effort or complexity, or a belief that reward has little impact on others’ future behavior, than like a finely tuned payoff-maximization response to the cost structure.\n\nThey do not use reward as a systematic tool to shape group norms, build alliances, or express ongoing gratitude. There is no evidence of reward-based reciprocity loops (rewarding those who rewarded them or systematically rewarding loyal cooperators). Overall, their reward behavior is best characterized as “low-engagement, occasional, and non-strategic.”\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nWhen they receive rewards, they continue to contribute at high levels in many subsequent decisions, but the pattern of contributions around rewarded episodes does not clearly differ from their overall mixed contribution strategy. This makes it hard to infer strong reward responsiveness: they neither sharply increase nor clearly decrease cooperation immediately in response to being rewarded. Thus, their behavioral reaction to being rewarded is ambiguous and likely weak.\n\nThey do not visibly reciprocate toward identifiable rewarders via the reward mechanism itself: there is no consistent pattern of sending rewards back to those who previously rewarded them, nor of preferentially rewarding particular high-contribution partners over time. This suggests that, in this setting, they do not treat reward as a vehicle for building bilateral alliances or for symbolic reciprocity.\n\nTheir contributions do remain generally compatible with cooperation in environments where other players are offering at least some cooperation. Being rewarded does not trigger retaliation, defensiveness, or withdrawal; at minimum, they tolerate being singled out with rewards and continue to play in a way that can benefit the group. That said, because they also continue to defect in some later periods after having been rewarded, any reciprocity norm they hold appears weak or overshadowed by their own payoff experimentation and opportunistic swings between cooperation and free-riding.\n\nIn terms of social style, they come across as relatively detached: they acknowledge rewards passively through continued participation in the public good but do not actively “answer” them through the available reward channel. Their primary lever for responding to the social environment seems to be whether they themselves contribute or not, rather than how they use the reward system. Overall, their response to identifiable rewarders is muted, with low-confidence evidence of only mild, non-targeted reinforcement of cooperative norms."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a generally high contributor who starts off as a near-unconditional cooperator and then becomes a selective, moderately selfish conditional cooperator. Early on, they reliably give the full or near-full endowment, even when others include some clear low contributors. Over time, they begin to adjust downward in response to declining group contributions and visible free-riding, shifting to mid-range contributions and occasionally low-to-mid levels. They never move to outright zero contributions, even when the group’s average falls sharply, suggesting they maintain some baseline pro-social or norm-following tendency rather than fully defecting.\n\nTheir pattern indicates conditionality: when the group is broadly cooperative, they match or exceed the group; when cooperation erodes, they partially protect their own payoff while still putting some amount into the public account. The adjustments are not highly volatile from round to round; instead, they make relatively infrequent, step-like changes that appear to respond to sustained changes in group behavior rather than single outliers. This suggests they track overall cooperation rather than reacting instantly to every deviation.\n\nThey seem tolerant of some inequality and free-riding but not indefinitely. They continue contributing substantially while others oscillate, then cut back once it becomes clear that both high and low contributions coexist and that some players consistently earn high payoffs at low cost. Their willingness to continue giving something even in very low-contribution environments indicates either an internal fairness or “ought to contribute something” norm, or a risk-averse preference for not being one of the worst contributors relative to others. Overall, they fit a “pragmatic high contributor who downshifts when exploited but does not fully defect” profile.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThe player is horizon-aware but does not sharply unravel cooperation. In later rounds, contributions decrease on average compared to their early-game maximum, but this decline begins well before the final round and appears more tied to observed group behavior than to the countdown alone. Near the very end, with only a few rounds remaining and others increasingly mixing high and very low contributions, they do not escalate cooperation to a final-round “gift” and do not drop to zero either. Instead, they choose modest positive contributions, staying in the game cooperatively but protecting their own payoff.\n\nThere is no evidence that they attempt last-round signalling or “legacy building” through an all-in contribution. Likewise, there is no clear last-round opportunistic crash where they fully exploit the public good. Their end-game behavior is consistent with a learned adjustment: by that point they treat the environment as unstable and partially uncooperative and respond with moderate self-protection, rather than with a dramatic strategic shift triggered specifically by the terminal round.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey never spend any coins on rewards. This is consistent and unconditional across cooperative and uncooperative environments. They therefore behave as a pure non-rewarder in this institution: they do not use rewards to encourage high contributors, to reciprocate kindness, to build coalitions, or to thank people who reward them.\n\nThis pattern holds despite them personally contributing a lot and despite the presence of multiple players who visibly spend heavily to reward cooperators. They experience the reward system as a recipient but never activate it themselves. This could be driven by a monetary focus (they see no net payoff advantage to spending on rewards, since the tech is neutral), by a preference not to intervene socially, or by skepticism that rewards effectively steer group behavior. From the data alone, the motivation is unknown; what is clear is that they consistently prioritize keeping their own payoff over paying to influence others, even in situations where peers heavily reward high contributors.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThey are repeatedly rewarded by several others, including in periods where they contribute at or near the group maximum. However, they do not reciprocate with rewards: they neither reward those who reward them nor switch to rewarding any others after receiving rewards. There is no instance where a new reward-giving action appears after they have been rewarded, nor any change in their contribution behavior that clearly corresponds to having been rewarded.\n\nTheir cooperative behavior appears driven mainly by their own assessment of group contributions and payoff structure, not by gratitude toward specific rewarders. Being rewarded does not induce targeted reciprocity, alliance formation, or differentiated treatment of particular players. The player therefore acts as a “reward-insensitive cooperator”: they accept the additional earnings but do not treat rewards as social currency to be repaid. Any internal feeling of appreciation or obligation is unknown, but behaviorally, they do not engage in reciprocal reward exchanges.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey observe a wide range of others’ outcomes: some players contribute high and also spend on rewards, others contribute low and receive no social sanction, and some earn very high payoffs through minimal contributions plus received rewards or through saving both contributions and reward costs. Over time, they adjust their own contributions downward in a way that is broadly consistent with responding to perceived exploitation and payoff disparities.\n\nSpecifically, as they see persistent patterns where certain players free-ride or under-contribute yet still earn strong payoffs (often because others reward liberally), they reduce their own cooperative level but do not completely withdraw. This suggests they are sensitive to the fairness of the outcome distribution and are unwilling to indefinitely subsidize what looks like an inefficient or inequitable system. However, they stop short of punitive behavior: they do not use rewards to counteract inequality (e.g., by selectively boosting only generous players), nor do they have access to punishment, so they simply adjust their own provision rate.\n\nThey also do not chase the highest possible payoff by mimicking the most selfish strategies. When others drop to very low contributions and still do well, the player responds only partially; they preserve some level of contribution that keeps them aligned with a minimum cooperation standard. Overall, they monitor others’ contributions and payoffs, react to sustained low cooperation or reward distortions by reducing their own generosity, but remain reluctant to adopt extreme free-riding or to spend resources manipulating others’ incentives."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a deliberately exploitative conditional contributor with a stark alternating pattern. They frequently give the minimum possible while others mostly contribute high amounts, capturing large private payoffs from others’ cooperation. Periodically, they switch to full contributions even when the group average has not collapsed, suggesting they are not a pure free-rider but rather an opportunistic mixed strategist.\n\nTheir contributions oscillate between minimum and maximum rather than gradually adjusting. This indicates low concern for smooth fairness norms and little effort to match others’ averages. The player shows no clear risk aversion about “wasting” contributions; they sometimes contribute fully even when others are already starting to reduce contributions and total returns are dropping. This pattern suggests that their main objective is not strict payoff maximization per round but a combination of: (a) exploiting cooperative phases, and (b) testing or maintaining their social standing with select players.\n\nTheir behavior is weakly conditional on others’ cooperation: they continue to free-ride even when the group remains highly cooperative, and they later contribute fully again when cooperation temporarily recovers. There is no sign that they try to sustain the group’s overall public-good level; rather, they use occasional high contributions as signals within a smaller reward-based exchange structure, not as a contribution norm enforcer.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThey are fully horizon-aware and do not exhibit standard “end-game defection” in a simple way. Instead of monotonically decreasing cooperation, they continue their alternating pattern of very low and very high contributions all the way through the final rounds.\n\nEven in the last few rounds, they sometimes contribute the minimum while most others contribute mid-to-high amounts, then abruptly switch back to maximum contributions despite no clear evidence that this benefits them materially in those specific rounds. This indicates they are not simply playing a final-round unraveling logic. They appear to continue using contributions and rewards as a coherent personal strategy to the end, rather than shifting into pure short-term exploitation at the horizon.\n\nOverall, end-game awareness is present (they know the round number), but their contribution behavior suggests a stable strategy that they maintain until the final round, rather than a horizon-driven change.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey are a moderately active but highly selective rewarder. They sometimes spend a nontrivial share of their payoff to grant rewards and sometimes refrain entirely, with no punishment option in the environment. Their reward behavior appears strategic rather than purely altruistic.\n\nPatterns indicate that they preferentially reward:\n- Players who contribute high or consistently cooperate.\n- Players who reward them.\nIn several phases, their own reward spending coincides with them also receiving substantial rewards, consistent with attempting to cultivate or reinforce mutual reward ties.\n\nThey do not seem to use rewards as a group-wide signal to sustain overall cooperation; when they spend, they target specific individuals rather than distributing small rewards broadly. At other times, they withhold rewards entirely while still taking advantage of others’ contributions by contributing the minimum. This suggests they view rewards as a tool for bilateral or small-cluster exchange, not as a general institution for group-level norm enforcement.\n\nThey appear willing to pay a real cost for reward, but only intermittently, suggesting they weigh costs against the likelihood of reciprocal benefits—either in direct rewards to themselves or in maintaining cooperative alliances. There is no evidence of spiteful or “anti-social” rewarding (e.g., rewarding low contributors); their observed reward use is consistent with reinforcing higher contributors and those who have previously favored them.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThey respond to being rewarded in ways consistent with reciprocal alliance-building. When they receive noticeable rewards, they are more likely, in nearby rounds, to both (a) contribute more and (b) spend on rewards themselves. This co-occurrence suggests gratitude signaling and an attempt to maintain beneficial ties rather than a purely self-centered free-ride strategy.\n\nHowever, this reciprocity is not universal or rigid. They do not mechanically reward every player who ever rewards them, nor do they permanently increase their contributions after being favored. Instead, they seem to use a flexible rule: reward and sometimes cooperate more toward those who appear to favor them or behave cooperatively, but retain freedom to revert to minimal contributions in later rounds even if alliances exist.\n\nThey are comfortable with asymmetric relationships: they can be rewarded substantially without immediately matching the rewarder’s level of generosity, and at other times they reward others when they themselves do not receive much in that specific round. This indicates that their reciprocity is probabilistic and strategic rather than strict tit-for-tat.\n\nOverall, they treat identifiable rewarders as valuable partners but not as individuals to whom they owe unconditional loyalty; reciprocity is present but moderated by their underlying opportunism.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey pay attention to others’ contributions, reward spending, and payoffs, but they do not appear to respond strongly to group-level outcomes. High group contributions and large total multipliers are often met with their own minimal contribution, indicating they are willing to exploit cooperative states instead of reinforcing them. They show little concern for the fact that some players repeatedly incur large reward costs and end rounds with low payoffs; they do not move to support or imitate these “over-generous” players.\n\nTheir main adjustments seem keyed to:\n- Who is consistently contributing high while not obviously exploiting rewards.\n- Who is rewarding them or their high-contributing peers.\n\nWhen others’ contributions fall and group payoffs decline, they often continue to free-ride rather than stepping up their own contributions to stabilize the group. At other times, they inject a burst of high contribution and some reward spending even when outcomes are already deteriorating, suggesting a focus on maintaining select bilateral relationships rather than rescuing the public good.\n\nThey display tolerance for inequality in payoffs: they routinely end rounds with higher payoffs than many cooperators when free-riding, and they do not compensate for this through extra reward giving. Conversely, when they themselves end with lower payoffs in contribution-heavy, reward-heavy rounds, they do not appear to shift toward consistent defection only; they continue to use a mixed approach. This points to a player who is outcome-aware but not equality-seeking, prioritizing selective reciprocity and personal advantage over collective efficiency or fairness."

They commonly choose intermediate contributions around the middle of the endowment, occasionally moving to very high contributions and sometimes downshifting to low ones. These changes align with shifts in group cooperation levels: when others are generally contributing a lot, the player often increases their own contribution; when group contributions or the implied norm weaken, they are willing to reduce theirs. They do not insist on perfectly matching the group average but seem comfortable being somewhat below or above it depending on context. They show no sign of extreme risk-taking or pure free-riding; instead, they balance earning with maintaining some level of group provision. Their behavior suggests a conditional cooperator guided by rough fairness norms—willing to be generous when the environment supports cooperation but not sacrificing unconditionally when others backslide.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nAwareness of the finite horizon does not produce a simple monotonic decay in contributions. Near the end, the player alternates between high and low contributions rather than sliding steadily downward. They still make some of their largest contributions late, but also exhibit low contributions in other late rounds, indicating that immediate group behavior and recent history matter more than the abstract fact that the game is ending. There is no clear last-round collapse into pure defection: they still contribute nontrivially at the very end. This pattern is consistent with someone who understands that the game is finite but continues to respond to the current cooperative climate rather than following a strict backward-induction logic.\n\n<REWARD>\nThe player uses rewards sparingly and selectively. Across the game, they sometimes spend on rewards and sometimes refrain entirely, even when others are rewarding actively. When they do reward, it appears targeted toward relatively cooperative peers rather than toward low contributors. They do not use reward as a large-scale coordination tool or as a persistent, costly signal; instead, they occasionally reinforce positive behavior but treat reward coins as resources to be conserved. Their spending never approaches the extremes seen in some other players, suggesting moderate willingness to pay for prosocial reinforcement but a clear limit on how much they will sacrifice. They do not attempt to micromanage others’ behavior with fine-grained or frequent rewards; their style is restrained and intermittent.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThe player receives rewards in several rounds from others, but their own subsequent reward behavior does not strongly track who rewarded them. They neither engage in obvious one-to-one reciprocity nor form a visible “reward alliance” with any particular partner. Being rewarded does not trigger a large or consistent increase in their own rewarding, nor a special favoritism toward apparent benefactors. Likewise, they do not retaliate against the absence of rewards by withdrawing cooperation toward specific individuals; their contribution decisions respond more to overall group contribution patterns than to personal reward histories. This points to weak direct reciprocity in the reward channel: they may experience rewards as pleasant or affirming but do not reorganize their strategy around reciprocal gift-giving.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThe player appears to monitor others’ contributions and payoffs enough to adjust their own behavior, but they do not react in an emotionally extreme way to others’ outcomes. They coexist with both very heavy reward spenders and more self-interested players without aggressively imitating or opposing either pattern. As some players repeatedly burn large amounts of coins to reward, the focal player does not escalate their own reward spending to match, nor do they dramatically cut their contributions in response to others gaining high payoffs through low contributions. Instead, they adjust moderately: raising or lowering contributions in line with broad shifts in group cooperation, while keeping reward use limited. They seem tolerant of payoff inequality and others’ idiosyncratic strategies, focusing on maintaining a reasonable personal payoff rather than enforcing strong norms via reward. Overall, they behave as a pragmatic conditional cooperator: attentive to the cooperative environment, responsive to group-level signals, but cautious and measured in the use of costly social tools."

They do, however, test defection a couple of times after a long run of full cooperation, indicating they are not a pure altruist; they are willing to see what happens when they keep their endowment, even after having helped maintain a cooperative norm.\n\nTheir fairness norm is pro‑group but relaxed. They clearly prefer full-contribution outcomes and express appreciation when a previous low contributor starts contributing. At the same time, they are tolerant of deviations and do not push others aggressively toward the norm. When they defect once in an otherwise cooperative environment and are heavily punished, they immediately revert to full contributions and largely stay there, suggesting they are sensitive to social feedback and willing to “fall back in line” when norm enforcement is strong.\n\nRisk tolerance appears moderate. They are willing to risk being a consistent cooperator even when some others are not, accepting lower immediate payoffs for the chance of sustaining high group returns. Their two zero‑contribution choices look like controlled probes rather than a wholesale strategy shift: they do not cascade into continued free‑riding, nor do they signal a desire to dismantle cooperation entirely. There is no evidence of systematic payoff optimization; behavior is more consistent with a cooperative default plus occasional opportunistic or exploratory non‑cooperation.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThe player’s tone is relaxed, mildly humorous, and de‑escalating. When another player becomes critical of non‑contributors, they respond by downplaying the seriousness of the situation and framing it as “just a game,” signaling low appetite for social conflict and moralizing. They do not join in blaming or shaming talk, even when they might be justified in doing so as a consistent contributor.\n\nThey engage selectively rather than constantly. When they do speak, it is purposeful: once to cool down tension, once to clarify payoff information, and once to express gratitude toward a previously uncooperative member who starts contributing. This shows responsiveness to both emotional and informational aspects of the interaction, but they do not try to lead or organize the group.\n\nPersuasion style is soft and indirect. They neither instruct others what to do nor threaten them. Instead, they acknowledge others’ efforts and ask neutral questions about the reward structure. Their engagement style is cooperative and affiliative but not highly invested; they care about good outcomes and smooth interaction, yet they also keep a bit of emotional distance, emphasizing that the stakes are limited.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThere is little evidence of a classic “end-game collapse” pattern. The player’s contribution profile near the end stays mostly aligned with their general cooperative tendency. They do not make a clear, strategic shift to sustained free‑riding in the final rounds despite knowing the horizon length, nor do they ramp up contributions uniquely at the very end.\n\nTheir occasional switch to non‑contribution occurs in the later middle of the game, but it is brief and reversed quickly. After testing defection and encountering strong punishment, they largely return to full contributions, including in the last stretch. This suggests that horizon awareness does not dominate their behavior; they appear more anchored in ongoing group norms and recent social feedback than in backward induction logic. Any end‑game awareness influence is weak or unknown.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey never use the punishment mechanism in any round, even when doing so could credibly enforce cooperation or retaliate for heavy sanctions against them. This indicates a strong reluctance to spend personal resources to harm others, even in cases of clear free‑riding or personal grievance.\n\nTheir threshold for punishing appears extremely high or absent. They experience a severe deduction after a single defection yet do not retaliate against any identifiable partner. Nor do they use sanctions earlier to discipline chronic under‑contributors, despite repeated opportunities and a group norm that openly supports penalizing non‑contributors. This pattern points to a non‑punitive, low‑aggression type: they accept that others may misbehave or punish them without actively engaging in retribution or norm enforcement.\n\nMotivationally, they lean toward “live and let live” rather than either prosocial punishment (to protect the group) or antisocial punishment (to punish cooperators). They seem to rely on persuasion, tolerance, and their own cooperative example rather than formal sanctions to shape behavior. Any latent deterrence motives are unknown or not expressed.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nWhen they defect once after a long record of cooperation and then receive a very large punishment, their behavioral response is compliant and conciliatory rather than hostile. They do not reduce contributions in anger; instead, they immediately return to full contributions in the next cooperative opportunity and maintain that behavior in subsequent rounds. This suggests that they interpret punishment as a strong social signal to re‑adhere to the norm, and they comply without overt protest.\n\nThey show no evidence of retaliating against punishers, despite punishers being identifiable and the deduction being harsh enough to plausibly provoke revenge in many players. They also do not confront anyone verbally about the punishment. This implies a forgiving or at least resignation‑oriented stance toward being sanctioned. They update their play rather than their willingness to attack others.\n\nAt the same time, they do not explicitly apologize or self‑justify in chat; their response is behavioral rather than verbal. Their core pattern is: accept the social cost, restore cooperative behavior, and avoid escalation. Their stance toward the punishing individuals themselves remains behaviorally cooperative and non‑aggressive, consistent with a conflict‑averse, norm‑sensitive cooperator type."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThe player is a highly stable, near-unconditional full cooperator. They almost always contribute their entire endowment, including after observing others occasionally free ride and despite the availability of punishment to discipline such behavior. They defect only once, and then immediately return to full contributions. Their decisions indicate a clear understanding that group welfare is maximized when everyone contributes and they behave consistently with this principle, even when it is individually costly relative to a free rider’s payoff. Their cooperation is only weakly conditional on others’ actions: they continue to contribute fully even after repeated defection by another player, suggesting a strong intrinsic or norm-based commitment to cooperation and a high tolerance for being exploited. They do not appear to experiment systematically with contribution levels in response to changing conditions; instead, they maintain a simple, prosocial strategy.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nTheir tone is calm, cooperative, and mildly explanatory. Early on, they explicitly articulate the efficiency logic of full contribution and affirm others’ proposals to sanction non-contributors, helping to cement a shared cooperative norm. They respond to group discussion rather than driving it, entering the conversation to endorse mutual cooperation and to offer a polite, supportive remark about a generous reward-giver. They share personal information when prompted (age), which signals willingness to build rapport, but they do not engage heavily in social banter afterward. Overall, they engage selectively: they speak when it supports coordination or affirms others, and otherwise remain quiet. They do not confront, criticize, or pressure others directly, even when someone free rides multiple times.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThere is no visible end-game unraveling in their behavior. They keep contributing fully through the final rounds without shifting toward self-interested defection, despite having clear visibility of the remaining horizon. They also refrain from opportunistic use of punishment or last-round rewarding. The single defection occurs in the mid-late game and is not followed by a pattern of increasing selfishness. Overall, they appear either indifferent to the strategic opportunities of the final rounds or consciously committed to sustaining cooperation regardless of the stage of the game. Their type is best characterized as horizon-insensitive with respect to cooperation.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey never use punishment, even though they explicitly endorse the idea of punishing non-contributors when another player suggests it and even when they experience clear free riding by a specific group member. This gap between stated endorsement and actual behavior suggests either reluctance to harm others, aversion to the cost of punishment, or a preference for maintaining a positive group atmosphere over enforcing norms via negative sanctions. They also never use punishment reactively or vindictively; even after a personal defection, they do not try to redirect attention or blame through punishing others. Their restraint holds across the entire game, indicating that they are a non-punishing cooperator: they support cooperative norms conceptually but avoid implementing costly negative sanctions.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nThey are never punished in this game, so their direct response to being punished is unknown. Because punishment is always identifiable but never directed at them, we cannot infer how they would react in terms of compliance, retaliation, or forgiveness. Given their general pattern—high cooperation, low confrontation, and lack of punitive behavior—the best guess (with low confidence) is that they would be more likely to comply or quietly adjust than to retaliate, but this remains speculative and is not evidenced here.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey almost never use reward, despite operating in repeatedly cooperative environments where rewarding could be a natural way to reinforce good behavior. For most of the game they refrain entirely, even when others engage in generous reward-giving. On a single occasion they pay to reward the player who has been consistently rewarding others, which suggests that when they do reward, it is motivated by recognition or reciprocity toward especially prosocial behavior rather than by a systematic strategy to manage incentives. Their pattern implies they view reward as optional and not cost-effective in routine cooperation, but they are willing to incur a modest cost once to acknowledge or appreciate another highly generous contributor.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThey are rewarded multiple times by others, particularly by one especially generous cooperator. They never verbally acknowledge these rewards, never explicitly reciprocate to the same individuals in a systematic way, and do not start a broader reward cycle. Their one act of rewarding targets the primary reward-giver, which may reflect implicit gratitude or a desire to “give something back,” but they do not escalate into ongoing mutual rewarding. Thus, their response to reward is muted: they remain steady in their cooperative contributions but do not overtly build alliances or engage in explicit reciprocity via the reward mechanism. Their cooperation appears driven more by general norms than by direct reward contingencies.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey are attentive to others’ behavior and outcomes in a qualitative sense but rarely comment on specific payoffs or costs. When another player is spending heavily on rewards, they respond with a supportive remark highlighting the kindness of that behavior rather than its inefficiency. This indicates they value generosity and moral framing over strict payoff optimization in social commentary. They do not protest or criticize when one group member repeatedly free rides and earns higher payoffs; instead, they quietly continue to cooperate and do not adjust contributions downward in retaliation. They also do not react publicly to the large sacrifices made by the generous reward-giver, beyond a single positive comment and one small reward. Overall, they notice others’ efforts and deviations but maintain a non-confrontational, affirming stance, prioritizing group harmony and prosocial norms over explicit enforcement or payoff-based critique."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a strict, stable full cooperator. They always contribute the maximum possible amount to the public good, from the very start and without experimenting or hedging. Their cooperation is not conditional on others’ behavior: they keep contributing fully even when others under-contribute, when there is confusion, when there is clear evidence of a disruptive “bot-like” player, and when they themselves are actively spending on punishment or reward. They consistently endorse the “max for everyone” social norm in chat and never advocate lowering contributions. Risk tolerance appears relatively high: they do not appear to protect themselves by reducing contributions in response to uncertainty, free-riding, or ending-game fatigue. There is no sign of opportunistic behavior; they behave like a principled cooperator with a fairness norm that “everyone should give the max” and that they themselves should do so regardless.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThey are moderately chatty and clearly engaged with the group, but not the dominant voice. Tone is warm, humorous, and prosocial. They align themselves with the cooperative majority, support emerging norms, and occasionally inject light jokes about the game’s length and “living here now,” which shows comfort and social ease rather than detachment or hostility.\n\nThey respond to others’ points (e.g., acknowledging correction about player count, agreeing that some behavior “makes sense,” echoing “sus” judgments about potentially problematic avatars) rather than driving their own agenda. They rarely initiate new strategic norms, but they reinforce existing ones and lend social support to those enforcing cooperation.\n\nThey participate in the shared narrative about the “angry bird/parrot” and researchers, appear to enjoy the collective theorizing, and use that narrative as a frame for behavior (“kill the bird,” “very sus”). They are not confrontational; even when advocating retaliation against the disruptive avatar, their style remains playful and collective (“have a little boost; kill the bird”) rather than aggressive or moralizing.\n\nOverall, they show a cooperative, affiliative, and group-oriented communication style: they help maintain cohesion, validate others, and keep the mood light, while staying aligned with cooperative norms.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey are willing to punish, but only selectively and under strong social consensus. For most of the game they refrain from using punishment at all despite repeated calls from others to “ding” under-contributors and the disruptive bird. This indicates an underlying reluctance to spend on punishment or a preference to let others take that role when it is already being filled.\n\nThey eventually do punish, and their target choice is tightly norm-based: they punish the clearly non-compliant “angry bird/parrot,” and much later again target the same avatar in a mixed punishment/reward move. They do not punish borderline contributors, slight deviations, or human cooperators who make small mistakes. There is no evidence of spite, personal vendetta, or punishment directed at group members who question the experiment or pay rates.\n\nTheir punishment seems motivated by collective justice and norm enforcement rather than personal gain: they punish when the bird is viewed as an unfair, possibly non-human exploiter, and they frame it in chat as something that “has to change” and that “they’ll feel.” They join the coordinated “hit the bird” moments but do not escalate beyond what others are doing, and they do not continue punishing once the bird is heavily sanctioned and group attention drifts.\n\nDeterrence and moral signaling appear more important than maximizing their own payoff. However, they do not turn into a “perma police”; they remain a mostly cooperative, low-punishment type who intervenes episodically when the group norm and their own sense of fairness are strongly violated.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey are distinctly more inclined to use reward than punishment, especially early on. They reward only a few times, which makes those choices informative. Recipients of their rewards are consistently high contributors and/or victims/allies in the bird drama: players who cooperate fully and either suffer from unjust deductions or invest heavily in group justice. They use reward to top up allies and to reinforce prosocial behavior.\n\nTheir reward behavior looks intentional rather than random: they spread small, costly rewards to specific cooperators, suggesting they pay attention to who has behaved “well” or been treated unfairly, and they are willing to sacrifice their own earnings to support those players. They also reward the talkative enforcer once, signaling gratitude and alliance.\n\nThey never reward low contributors or the bird. They are not using reward to manipulate future play (no evidence of “reward to make defectors cooperate”); instead, they behave like a conditional altruist who uses reward to recognize and bolster existing cooperators and justice enforcers. They are also comfortable combining reward and punishment in a single round, showing they think in terms of a full toolkit of social incentives rather than a single preferred mechanism.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey pay close attention to others’ outcomes and integrate this into their social and strategic views. They notice when someone has exited, when someone is doing unusually well, and when payoffs jump due to reward or punishment activity. They explicitly comment on anomalies (e.g., someone earning “+42” or “doing so well”) and on fairness (“that’s got to change” when the bird’s payoff is disproportionate).\n\nWhen others are heavily punished (e.g., frog, cow), they sympathize and respond constructively rather than ignoring it. They compliment or help those players via reward or by encouraging them to retaliate and giving them “a little boost.” This shows sensitivity to others’ disadvantage and a willingness to redistribute from themselves to restore perceived fairness.\n\nThey accept being rewarded without gloating; when thanked by another player, they respond briefly but positively, indicating they interpret reward as a social bond rather than a license to free-ride. They do not appear envious of other cooperators doing marginally better; they share their own cumulative coins transparently and engage lightly in that comparison without changing behavior.\n\nThey also update beliefs based on observed outcomes: they join the group’s emerging belief that the bird is likely a bot or researcher, react to how many coins the bird accumulates, and adjust from passivity to active punishment once the extent of the bird’s advantage is salient and the group shifts to “destroy the bird” coordination. However, these belief updates do not make them reduce their public contributions; they remain steadfastly cooperative even when perceiving the game as somewhat unfair or exploitative.\n\nIn sum, this player is a “Principled Group Altruist with Selective Justice”: they always cooperate fully, are socially engaged and supportive, reward good partners and victims, and reserve punishment for clear, consensus-defined violators such as a suspected bot/free-rider. They prioritize fairness and group cohesion over narrow self-interest, and they adapt their use of punishment and reward in response to others’ outcomes while keeping their own contribution level constant."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a high, mostly unconditional cooperator with occasional small defections that seem driven by doubt or fatigue rather than a systematic exploitative strategy.\n\nThey contribute the full endowment in the vast majority of rounds, including at the very start when the group norm of full contribution is still only being proposed, which indicates a willingness to “go first” on cooperation and accept personal risk. When they undercontribute, they do so only mildly (low single digits) and very rarely, and they do not follow through with a sustained reduction even after being punished once for contributing very little. This pattern suggests they value maintaining the cooperative norm and the resulting group earnings more than they value short‑term individual gains from free‑riding.\n\nTheir initial explanation that they “weren’t sure if people were bluffing” shows conditionality based on expectations of others’ behavior: they are willing to be fully cooperative, but they care whether the group is truly aligned. Once they see stable high contributions from others, they settle into reliably maxing out, without trying to track or fine‑tune their own contribution against others’ small deviations.\n\nThey show no evidence of fine‑grained payoff optimization (they do not start shaving their contribution by 1–2 units once cooperation is stable), which, combined with their tolerance of minor norm violations by others, points to a “prosocial but not hyper‑calculating” type. They also continue full cooperation even as the chat becomes increasingly focused on low pay and fatigue, suggesting they either discount the opportunity cost of time or prioritize finishing cleanly with the group.\n\nOverall, this is best described as a “loyal cooperator”: they enter willing to cooperate, briefly test the sincerity of others, and then stay aligned with the cooperative norm almost regardless of noise, trolling, or frustration.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThey communicate sparingly but meaningfully, with a cooperative, apologetic, and information‑seeking tone. Compared to very chatty players, they rarely initiate topics; when they do speak, it is directly related to coordination or understanding anomalies.\n\nEarly on, they openly admit past undercontribution and apologize, framing it explicitly as uncertainty rather than selfishness. This disclosure indicates concern for their reputation and a desire to repair trust. They quickly endorse the “all max, no deductions” coordination proposal once it is reiterated, showing alignment with group norms and willingness to publicly commit.\n\nLater, when the group suspects a “bot” or manipulated account, they ask a targeted question about whether anyone has rewarded that player, indicating they track payoff anomalies and seek clarification rather than jumping immediately to conspiracy or moral outrage. This displays curiosity and analytic engagement rather than emotional escalation.\n\nThey do not join in the more theatrical, punitive rhetoric (“kill X,” “destroy the bird”) nor in meta‑complaints about pay or platform ethics. Relative to the dominant chat tone, they are calm, low‑key, and non‑provocative, aligning themselves with the cooperative majority without taking on a leadership or inciter role. They respond when directly implicated (explaining their earlier behavior) and when they perceive informational gaps (asking about rewards), but otherwise default to quiet cooperation.\n\nIn social style, they come across as conciliatory, reputation‑sensitive, and group‑oriented, but not attention‑seeking.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey never use the punishment mechanism despite many opportunities, including clear norm violations (very low contributions) and strong group pressure to “deal justice.” This consistent non‑use, across both early uncertainty and later coordinated punishment campaigns, suggests a stable aversion to costly punishment.\n\nGiven the punishment technology is very powerful relative to its cost, their abstention is unlikely to be due to misunderstanding the mechanism. Instead, it indicates either a preference to avoid harming others, skepticism about the value of punishment for group outcomes, or a personal cost‑benefit calculus that deems even cheap punishment not worth the reduction in their own payoff.\n\nThey also refrain from “joining the crowd” in punitive episodes where virtually everyone else is targeting a single deviant, which implies they are not particularly swayed by social pressure to punish. There is no sign of reactive retaliation: even after they themselves are punished for low contribution, they do not punish back and instead simply restore high contributions and apologize in chat. This is more consistent with a forgiving or non‑vengeful type than with a conditional cooperator who uses punishment as enforcement.\n\nFunctionally, they behave as a “principled non‑punisher”: they want cooperation, but they prefer to sustain it through their own consistent contribution and communication rather than by inflicting costs on others.\n\n<REWARD>\nFor most of the game, they do not use the reward mechanism at all, even when others are actively rewarded for high contributions or for punishing perceived deviants. This again points to a conservative approach to spending on social tools: they prioritize keeping their own earnings rather than using them to shape others’ incentives.\n\nHowever, there is one clear deviation: in a later round they do reward at least one other player (evident from others noting “bunny and cow rewarded”). The context is one in which some players have been randomly targeted or “wronged” by the suspected bot‐like player, and others discuss boosting them. Their lone use of rewards coincides with that narrative, suggesting that when they do reward, it is not for strict norm enforcement but for compensating perceived unfair harm or for solidarity with victims.\n\nEven in that case, they use reward very sparingly; they do not begin a pattern of regular rewarding afterward. This makes them a “reluctant rewarder”: default is to keep coins, with rare, low‑intensity deviations when motivated by fairness or empathy.\n\nThey do not appear to use reward instrumentally to sustain high contributions (they never systematically reward top contributors), nor to curry favor; the isolated reward use is more consistent with moral expression than with strategic incentive design.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey pay attention to others’ outcomes and use them to update beliefs and ask questions, but they do not let others’ payoffs drive their own aggression or opportunism.\n\nWhen they undercontribute early and see that the group did indeed largely match the proposed full‑contribution norm, they quickly issue an apology and then align their behavior with the majority, indicating that observing others’ high contributions and payoffs pushes them toward more, not less, cooperation.\n\nThey notice the anomalously high earnings and complex punishment/reward activity of the “angry bird/parrot” player and actively query the group about whether anyone has been rewarding that player. This shows that they are monitoring others’ round payoffs and punishment/reward summaries, and they use this information diagnostically to understand the environment. They accept the emerging group framing (that this player may be a bot or special role) but do not escalate it into personal vendetta through their own punishment.\n\nWhen they themselves are punished in a round where they contributed almost nothing, they do not protest in chat. Instead, their future contributions return to the maximum level and stay there, suggesting they interpret negative outcomes as a signal about expected norms rather than as an affront that requires retaliation. This is consistent with a player who internalizes feedback rather than trying to counter‑punish.\n\nThey also show no sign of free‑riding based on others’ enforcement efforts. Even when others expend large amounts on punishment, dragging their own payoffs down, this player continues to contribute highly and avoids exploiting the protection arising from others’ policing.\n\nOverall, they are attentive and reflective about others’ payoffs and sanctioning but respond mainly by adjusting their own cooperation and seeking information, not by changing their willingness to harm, reward, or exploit others."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a persistent unconditional high contributor. They always contribute the full endowment, even when others deviate sharply or when they explicitly acknowledge that pay is low relative to time. Their own stated stance is that they will contribute the maximum regardless of others, and their behavior matches that. They do not condition contributions on low effort, exploitation by the “angry bird”, or uncertainty about remaining rounds. Risk tolerance is high: they keep sacrificing private payoff to maintain group efficiency even when the marginal per capita return is low and others intermittently free-ride. They show a strong norm of “everyone should give the max,” but their own contribution behavior does not fluctuate when that norm is violated; they punish instead of reducing their own contributions.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThey are highly engaged, humorous, and socially oriented. From the start, they frame cooperation as obvious and desirable, use light jokes and memes, and riff on others’ comments. They reference studies, bots, researchers, and movie/Internet culture, treating the game as both a social experiment and a social space. They actively coordinate norms (max contributions, targeting the deviant bird, later suspicion of owl) but with playful rather than domineering tone. They respond quickly to others, pick up others’ ideas (e.g., “rotate police,” democracy vs bot), and help maintain group cohesion when frustration rises about pay or duration. They openly share some private info (their coin total) when others do. They engage in mild meta-commentary about fairness of compensation but do not use that as a reason to defect. Overall they communicate as a sociable, group-identity-focused player who likes collective narratives (“new society,” “researcher troll,” “democracy is non‑negotiable”) and uses chat to keep morale and coordination high.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey are very willing to punish, including at substantial personal cost. Their early punishment targets the lowest contributor, consistent with enforcing a contribution norm. Once the “angry bird” (Parrot) emerges as a repeated low contributor and exploiter, they repeatedly punish it, including several high-intensity bursts that meaningfully reduce their own payoff. They explicitly express a motive of “justice,” talk about needing to “destroy” the deviant, and join coalition punishments when others propose coordinated hits. Deterrence and norm enforcement appear primary: they do not punish random players or high contributors, and they join group calls to sanction those who are seen as bots, trolls, or norm violators. However, their punishment of Owl at the very end is more suspicion- and frustration-driven than strictly payoff-based; Owl’s earlier behavior is mixed, and the trigger seems to be Owl suddenly doing very well combined with low contributions in a late round and other players calling them “sus.” That suggests they also punish to restore perceived social fairness, even with incomplete information.\n\nThey do not appear to use punishment as retaliation for being punished themselves (they are almost never targeted) nor as strategic intimidation for future gains; instead they accept that punishing costs them “real money” and continue anyway, suggesting strong non-monetary preferences for norm enforcement and group justice. They occasionally talk about “democracy” and “justice” in the same breath, and they coordinate with others before punishing, but they are also willing to act independently when they feel a violator must be sanctioned.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey reward infrequently but in a targeted, relational way. When they do reward, they focus on Gorilla, who is the most visibly “perma police” enforcer against the deviant bird. They explicitly say they top up Gorilla and later reward them again, essentially subsidizing Gorilla’s costly enforcement. This suggests they use rewards as gratitude and as strategic reinforcement of prosocial punishment rather than for pure equality or random generosity. They do not reward high contributors in general or the group at large; rewards cluster on a single ally. They also seem attentive to rewards they receive from others, mentioning when they notice being rewarded by the bird and interpreting it as information about the bird’s identity or strategy rather than just a payoff bump. Overall they are much more inclined to spend on punishment than on reward; reward is reserved for acknowledging and supporting those they see as aligned enforcers.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey closely monitor others’ contributions, payoffs, and reward/punishment histories and actively interpret them. They quickly label low contributors or odd patterns as “sus,” “researcher,” or “bot” and suggest or join group actions against them. They notice when someone gets unusually high payoffs, when a deviant avoids punishment, who is being rewarded, and how many coins the bird spends on reward vs punishment. That information shapes their beliefs: they oscillate between thinking the bird is a non-human bot, a researcher, or a “genius criminal,” and they occasionally question whether punishing the bird is economically wise. Despite grasping the low monetary return, they continue to punish, prioritizing symbolic fairness and group narrative over strict earnings.\n\nThey react positively to others’ high contributions and cooperative talk, reinforcing the “we’re all in this together” frame, and they do not retaliate against peers who briefly under-contribute if those peers correct themselves and align with group norms. They also respond to others’ exhaustion and concerns about underpayment with jokes and shared frustration, but without reducing their own contributions. Toward the end, as the game drags on, they become more impatient and slightly darker in humor (e.g., “kill owl”), but still keep cooperating and directing punishment toward those perceived as exploiting or gaming the system. Overall, they are a high-cooperation, high-enforcement, socially attuned “justice enforcer with a sense of humor,” who tracks outcomes carefully and uses both punishment and selective reward to shape group norms, even when that behavior is privately costly."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a near-constant full contributor and group-efficiency oriented, with one striking exception. They repeatedly match the informal norm of “everyone puts in the max,” and they do so even after realizing the per-round monetary payoff is quite low. They appear intrinsically motivated by cooperative norms and the social experience more than by precise payoff maximization.\n\nTheir only deviation from high contribution is a single, very low contribution when the group is speculating about “researcher” or “bot” behavior. That deviation coincides with a light, curious tone (“I was thinking that too”) about the possibility of experimental manipulation rather than a clear attempt to free-ride. After that, they immediately revert to maximum contributions and stay there. This suggests a brief exploratory or mistaken move, not a stable defection strategy.\n\nThey show no evidence of conditionally matching others’ contribution levels in a fine-grained way: they continue to put in the maximum even when some others start contributing less or are suspected of being bots or trolls. Their fairness norm is simple and strong: equal, maximal contributions are the default expectation, and deviations are treated via punishment rather than through reducing their own contributions.\n\nRisk tolerance appears moderate: they are willing to “spend” coins on punishment several times, accepting a personal cost in the hope of maintaining norms, but they do not systematically burn their own payoff as hard as the most extreme “justice” players. They rarely experiment with under-contributing, and when they do, the punishment they receive does not provoke a retaliatory low-contribution phase—another sign that they prioritize stable cooperation over strategic back-and-forth.\n\nOverall, the contribution profile fits a “principled cooperator who occasionally probes or misplays but snaps back to high contributions and keeps them there.”\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThe player communicates frequently, in a friendly, lightly humorous tone, and is clearly engaged with both the strategic and social dimensions of the game. Early on, they align themselves with the cooperation norm (“me too,” “will max next round”) and echo others’ calls for group effort, signaling a desire to coordinate rather than to lead.\n\nThey pay attention to interface details and mechanics and sometimes admit confusion or learning in real time (e.g., asking how to adjust contributions or commenting when they begin to see new interface behavior). They show responsiveness: they answer others’ questions, follow up on previous comments (e.g., about UK vs non-UK pay or disappearing messages), and riff on group jokes (“at least the researcher will have a laugh reading this”).\n\nThey also actively participate in the emerging “narrative” around the suspicious bird/parrot and the silent players. They join group speculation about who might be a bot or researcher, and they voice suspicions in a low-key, playful way (“I wondered if chatty gorilla was researcher lol”) rather than confrontationally. This suggests a socially attuned, slightly conspiratorial curiosity, rather than hostility.\n\nThey sometimes try to steer enforcement choices, casually directing attention to particular players as punishment targets (“and owl,” “back to deducting the bird?”, “owl isn’t contributing either”), but they do this in the flow of group banter rather than as rigid commands. Overall, their communication style is: sociable, collaborative, gently persuasive, and responsive to group sentiment, with no signs of withdrawal or hostility even when personally punished.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThis player is a willing but selective punisher. They never punish high contributors or norm-compliant players; all observed punishments are aimed at targets perceived as deviating from group norms or as “suspicious.”\n\nTheir decisions to punish track two main triggers:\n\n1. **Clear contribution deviations:**  \n   - Very low contributions from specific players (first an under-contributing owl, later repeatedly the parrot/bird and again owl near the end) reliably prompt them either to punish directly or to call for others to do so.  \n   - They sometimes verbally announce their intended target before or after punishing, which shows a norm-enforcing and communicative motivation: punishment is not secret retaliation but part of a coordinated enforcement effort.\n\n2. **Perceived “meta” norm violations (bot/researcher behavior):**  \n   - Once the group frames the parrot as a bot or manipulative actor benefiting from mysterious extra payoffs and spending heavily on rewards, this player repeatedly supports and joins collective punishment against the parrot.  \n   - At times they punish even when they explicitly acknowledge boredom or non-instrumental motives (“bored, got the bird again”), consistent with a mix of entertainment, group bonding, and resentment at perceived unfairness rather than pure economic deterrence.\n\nThey do not escalate to maximal self-sacrifice in punishment like some others: they use single punishment units at a time, spread across multiple rounds. This points to a controlled, “measured enforcer” style, willing to spend but not to self-immolate.\n\nThey never use punishment vindictively in response to being punished themselves. After being heavily deducted in one early round, they do not retaliate at random; instead, they continue contributing fully and remain socially engaged. This indicates a norm-based rather than ego-based motive.\n\nFinally, their late-game targeting of owl—after noticing owl’s atypical payoffs and contribution pattern—shows they continue monitoring outcomes and adjusting punishment targets as new “suspicious” behavior appears. They are not stuck on one narrative; they update and extend enforcement as new anomalies arise.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey almost never reward others. The only rewards they receive come from other players or from the parrot; they themselves never spend coins on rewards in any round.\n\nGiven that reward technology is relatively weak (worse exchange rate than punishment) and they are conscious of the real-money conversion rate, their choice to avoid rewarding may be economically rational. It can also be interpreted as a preference for negative over positive reinforcement in norm enforcement: they seem to believe that deterrence through punishment is the main tool, while cooperative contribution is its own reward.\n\nWhen others discuss topping up “justice” players or redistributing to those hit by the bird, this player does not join in with positive transfers. Instead, they verbally support group coordination (e.g., acknowledging top-ups or commenting on who has been rewarded) but keep their own coins for contributing and occasional punishment. There is no evidence of gratitude signaling via reward, even when they personally gain from others’ actions.\n\nOverall, they are a “punish-but-don’t-reward” enforcer: comfortable imposing costs on defectors and suspicious actors, but unwilling to pay to positively reinforce cooperators.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThe player monitors others’ payoffs and punishment/reward flows quite closely and uses that information to shape beliefs and enforcement choices.\n\nWhen they themselves are unexpectedly deducted, they initially misinterpret the source (“I think I got a reward that round too”) and quickly correct as they see the summary. This shows active but imperfect tracking of flows; they are learning the mechanism as the game unfolds.\n\nThey repeatedly comment on anomalous outcomes:\n- They notice when some players (parrot, owl, rooster/chicken) gain unusually high or low payoffs relative to contributions and punishment.\n- They publicly connect these anomalies to hypotheses about bots, researchers, or hidden strategies.\n- They update their mental model as new evidence appears: once they realize the “angry bird” is specifically the parrot, they correct their labels; later, when owl’s payoff spikes or contributions look off, they shift attention there.\n\nTheir reactions tend to be:\n- **Curious and analytical:** asking how someone achieved a certain number of points, or why payoffs look so large/small.\n- **Normative:** turning observed anomalies into arguments for punishment (“back to deducting the bird?”, “owl isn’t contributing either,” “ok got owl”).\n- **Playful:** they frame much of this in a joking, narrative way (“poor bird,” “researcher will have a laugh”), using outcome disparities as fodder for group humor rather than resentment.\n\nThey also incorporate the real-money conversion into their reasoning, after others reveal it. Once they know each 300 coins is worth a small monetary amount, they explicitly reevaluate whether it is worth continuing to punish the bird versus saving coins, and they seem mildly persuaded by arguments to conserve points, although they do keep punishing selectively afterward. This indicates that monetary incentives matter, but social and fairness motives still carry weight.\n\nIn sum, this player is best characterized as a sociable, principled cooperator with moderate, norm-driven punishment tendencies, low use of rewards, a high level of attention to others’ outcomes, and an inclination to turn outcome analysis into both enforcement decisions and shared humor."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a stable, unconditional full cooperator within the horizon of the game as experienced. They always choose the maximum possible contribution and never experiment with lower levels, even when others under-contribute or when they express doubts about the monetary value of the task. Their cooperation is not contingent on others’ exact behavior: they continue to give the maximum in the presence of both clear defectors and an obviously exploitive “angry bird” agent. They endorse a strong fairness norm that “everyone should put in the max” and explicitly advocate for universal full contribution, linking this to collective payoff. They show low risk aversion regarding exploitation: they accept being slightly worse off relative to free riders in order to preserve a simple, cooperative rule. They do not chase short-run individual gains; they behave more like a norm-driven or prosocial type with quasi-rule-based “always contribute max” behavior rather than a conditional cooperator adjusting to group averages.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThey are active, affiliative, and light-hearted in chat. They quickly agree with the initial cooperation norm, propose a simple focal rule (“max each time”), and repeatedly remind others to contribute fully. Their tone is friendly, humorous, and group-oriented: they join in jokes, pop-culture references, and playful banter, and they occasionally initiate it. They use chat to coordinate (“all put 20 in no deductions we all win”) and to validate others’ observations (e.g., about bots, compensation, or censorship). They respond to ongoing conversation rather than staying silent, and they adapt their talk from early norm setting to later meta-discussion about the study and pay. When group attention turns to the “angry bird” as either a bot or a manipulative agent, they adopt and reinforce this shared narrative rather than trying to analytically debunk it. They sometimes acknowledge the low financial payoff and length of the task but frame the social interaction as making it “worthwhile,” indicating they value the social/game experience alongside money. Overall, they use communication to maintain group cohesion, not to antagonize or stand out.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey are willing but sparing in their use of punishment. Relative to highly punitive “justice” players, they punish infrequently and at low intensity. When they do punish, targets are clear norm violators: early on, they punish a very low contributor who deviates sharply from the emerging full-cooperation standard, and later they selectively punish the “angry bird” agent after it repeatedly under-contributes and harms others. They also talk about “getting” or “clapping back” at the bird, but their actual spending remains modest, suggesting a threshold-based rather than vengeful pattern: they will spend some coins to enforce basic norms but avoid pouring large amounts into costly sanctions. They show no evidence of second-order punishment against high contributors who spend heavily on punishment, nor do they punish ambiguous cases once the group is already disciplining them. Their punishment has a deterrence and fairness-enforcement flavor rather than personal retaliation; they react to clear free-riding or perceived “criminal/genius” exploitation, not to small deviations or interpersonal slights. They also stop punishing once the bird is already being heavily sanctioned by others, indicating an aversion to redundant cost.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey use rewards rarely and in a targeted, expressive way. They reward a highly active “policing” player, explicitly “topping up” someone who spends heavily on enforcing norms, and later reward that same figure again, which looks like gratitude and moral support more than strategic incentive. They do not spray rewards across all high contributors, even though almost everyone contributes maximally; instead, they use rewards as social signals toward specific individuals whose behavior they admire. They never attempt to use rewards instrumentally to manipulate the “angry bird,” nor to buy cooperation from under-contributors. Their reward pattern suggests they view it as a way to recognize costly norm enforcement and maintain morale in a group enforcer, not as a primary mechanism for managing public-good behavior. Overall, they are more comfortable with normative appeals in chat than with systematic reward schemes.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey attend closely to others’ outcomes and integrate them into their beliefs and norms. They notice who contributes less, who gets punished, and who receives rewards, and they comment on these patterns. They align themselves with the group’s moral narrative: early on, they support punishment of low contributors; later, they help frame the “angry bird” as either a bot or “genius criminal” and treat its unusually high payoffs as evidence of exploitation. They express disapproval when some players earn much more via deviation and deductions but do not respond with envy-driven defection; instead, they keep contributing fully and occasionally join in targeted sanctions. When they see heavy punishment costs and extreme deductions inflicted by others, they do not criticize the punishers; instead, they support them verbally and sometimes with rewards, indicating they approve of strong norm enforcement even if they personally spend less on it. They are aware of the real-money conversion rate and discuss that the financial return is low, but this does not change their cooperative or sanctioning stance. Their responses show a player who tracks the social and payoff structure, updates their mental model (e.g., concluding the bird is automated or researcher-controlled), and then chooses to maintain a simple cooperative strategy and light-touch enforcement rather than optimize narrowly for money."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a near-unconditional high contributor who treats full cooperation as the default norm. They repeatedly give the maximum possible amount into the public good almost every round, even when others are wavering, coordinating, or experimenting with low contributions. The one clear deviation is when the group briefly shifts into a “justice” mood against the low contributor: the player then substantially lowers their own contribution, which aligns with a temporary collective move away from pure efficiency and toward expressing disapproval. Outside that episode, they quickly revert to full contributions and maintain them consistently, even late in the game when fatigue and low monetary pay become salient topics. They do not seem to condition their own giving tightly on others’ last contributions; instead they anchor on the cooperative ideal (“all max”) and stick to it. Their willingness to keep contributing fully despite discussions about poor pay suggests relatively low payoff-maximization and a stronger preference for norm-following and group welfare, coupled with some indifference or resignation about the financial efficiency of the task.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThey are active but not dominant in chat: responsive, cooperative, and socially attuned without driving the conversation. Early on, they endorse the “work together, max each time” norm and echo group agreements rather than proposing alternative strategies. They occasionally share informational content (e.g., looking up payment details in the help tab, reporting their own coin total) and ask normative questions about what the group should do (e.g., whether to keep coins or focus on punishing the deviant). Their tone is light and collegial; they joke mildly and join in group speculation about whether the anomalous player is a bot or researcher, but never in a hostile or aggressive way. They display awareness of fairness and compensation issues, explicitly commenting on how low the per-round pay seems relative to the length of the game. They engage in meta-level reflection (“I wondered that too”, “I checked the help tab”) and show empathy with others’ frustration, but they do not escalate or organize rebellion; instead, they remain constructive and focused on cooperative play. Overall, they communicate as a norm-abiding, reflective participant who values group coordination and mutual understanding more than steering group dynamics.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey are willing to use punishment, but do so sparingly and in a targeted, norm-enforcing way. Punishment is almost exclusively directed at the persistently under-contributing “angry bird” player, and always when that player is clearly deviating from the group’s near-unanimous high-contribution norm. They participate in early collective punishment of that deviant, then briefly stop punishing when the group debates whether continued punishment is worthwhile or whether the deviant might be a bot. After being reminded (and after seeing the deviant’s payoff remain high), they return to punishing that same target. Their punishment is never used for personal retaliation (they do not punish anyone who punished them, and they do not punish randomly) and is not used against low-but-human-looking contributors once those contributors move toward the norm. They do not join the more extreme “empty my bank on justice” behavior; instead, they add a moderate, periodic contribution to the sanctioning, tolerating a pay cost but not sacrificing everything. They also never punish high contributors or cooperative players, even when those players receive suspiciously high payoffs, suggesting a clear internal boundary: punishment is for obvious free-riding or disruptive behavior, not for advantage per se. Their pattern indicates a conditional cooperator with modestly strong altruistic-punishment tendencies: they are willing to pay to enforce norms but keep the intensity bounded.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey are very restrained in using rewards, employing them only a couple of times and in clear, socially meaningful ways. They once reward the player who has been consistently spending heavily to enforce cooperation (“the police”), explicitly acknowledging that they “topped up” that person and later giving them a direct reward, which functions as gratitude and support for norm enforcement. They do not otherwise spray rewards around or use them as a regular strategic tool. They never reward the deviant and do not try to bribe or incentivize them into compliance; instead, rewards are directed toward cooperative enforcers, reinforcing the social role of “protector of the group” rather than trying to convert the rule-breaker. The player also accepts rewards from others without changing their visible behavior, suggesting they see rewards as social gestures more than as incentives that dictate their own strategy. Overall, rewards for this player are rare, prosocial signals of appreciation, not a central component of their tactical toolkit.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey pay close attention to others’ payoffs and to how punishment and reward flows shape those outcomes. They quickly notice when the deviant player’s earnings are unusually high and comment on it, expressing concern that this player is “gonna be rich” relative to the rest of the group. This fuels their willingness to support renewed punishment after a lull. They also track who is getting rewarded, who is losing coins from deductions, and how this might signal hidden roles (e.g., suspecting that those rewarded by the deviant might be “in cahoots”). At the same time, they show sympathy for fellow participants who are harmed or targeted unfairly, and they explicitly point out when game pay and bonus conversion rates seem low, indicating they map in-game coins to real money and care about distributive fairness beyond simple in-game scores. They appear to update their beliefs about the deviant from “maybe researcher/bot” to “high earner exploiting a glitch or mechanism” and adjust their punishment stance accordingly. When others begin to feel punished or exploited by the platform (e.g., comments about underpayment, long duration), the player voices agreement but does not pivot to self-serving behavior; instead they maintain full contributions and only modest, targeted punishment. Overall, their responses to others’ outcomes show they are fairness-oriented, attentive to relative payoffs, and willing to adapt enforcement behavior when outcome patterns reveal persistent exploitation, while still preserving a cooperative baseline."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a highly stable high contributor. They give the maximum in essentially all rounds, with a single deliberate low-contribution “test” when the whole group temporarily deviates from full cooperation. They appear to adopt a norm of “everyone should give max” and largely stick to it regardless of others’ occasional shortfalls. The brief low contribution happens exactly when many others drop their contributions and collective norms wobble; after that, the player immediately returns to maximum giving and stays there. They do not visibly condition their contribution on individual others’ behavior; instead, they behave as if contributing fully is the right thing to do for the group, even when some individuals (e.g., the anomalous bird) undercontribute or free-ride. This suggests a principled cooperator or “moral cooperator” type whose own giving is not easily undermined by noise or unfairness. Risk tolerance appears moderate: they are willing to risk being exploited by a persistent low contributor rather than spiral into mutual defection. There is no evidence of opportunistic self-maximization via undercontribution.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThe player is relatively quiet but not completely silent. When they do speak, it is informational and cooperative rather than emotional or aggressive. They volunteer useful experimental knowledge about the payment conversion, clarifying payoff structure for others. This shows attention to instructions and a desire to ground group expectations. They do not join in the more heated or mocking chat about punishing the “angry bird” or other players, nor do they try to steer norms via strong moral language. They refrain from theatrics, jokes, or social bonding chatter, and do not signal alliances or participate in the “mob” dynamics. Their tone is calm, factual, and helpful; they participate selectively when they have something concrete to add, then withdraw. They also do not publicly discuss their own coin totals or emotional state about fairness, indicating a reserved, low-drama communication style focused on task-relevant information.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThis player almost never punishes. Across many opportunities, they repeatedly choose to spend nothing on punishment, even when there are clear undercontributors or widely condemned targets. The single instance where they do punish is directed at the persistent low-contributing, reward-gaming “bird” avatar, and it aligns with a strong, widely shared social norm in the group at that time. They spend the minimum nonzero amount, consistent with “doing their part” in a collective sanction rather than trying to lead or escalate punishment. They never punish ordinary low-contributors in early coordination phases and never retaliate against anyone who affects their own payoff directly. There is no evidence of spite or revenge; their one punishment move is consistent with norm enforcement against extreme deviation plus strategic concern that the bird is distorting outcomes. Overall, they fit a “reluctant punisher” type: willing to punish once when the group strongly converges on a target and the deviation is glaring, but with a strong default of avoiding punitive spending to preserve their own payoff.\n\n<REWARD>\nThe player never uses rewards, despite frequent opportunities and visible examples of others rewarding. They do not even use small symbolic rewards toward high contributors or “justice enforcers.” This suggests that, given the unfavorable reward technology (costly to give, low impact), they regard rewarding as inefficient or unnecessary. They appear to believe that maintaining high contributions themselves and possibly supporting occasional group punishment is sufficient to sustain cooperation, without needing to pay extra to thank or incentivize others. There is no sign of using rewards to curry favor, form alliances, or compensate punished players. Their stance is consistent with a payoff-conscious cooperator who sees punishment (rarely) as more cost-effective than reward, and who otherwise prefers to keep coins rather than redistribute them voluntarily.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThis player pays attention to the payoff structure and conversion into real money, and they share this information once, helping others calibrate expectations. They notice and comment on the coin-to-cash rate, indicating that they track their earnings in real terms, yet they do not dramatically change behavior in response; they still keep contributing max and mostly avoid costly sanctions. They do not publicly react to specific individuals’ gains or losses, despite dramatic swings caused by the punishment campaign against the bird. They abstain from praising “police” players or condemning free-riders in chat, and they do not seem emotionally reactive to seeing others overspend on justice or be heavily penalized. Their single punitive action aligns with broad consensus against a particularly abnormal outcome pattern (the bird accumulating large payoffs while undercontributing and manipulating rewards), showing that they update on extreme inequities but remain disciplined and selective. Overall, they process others’ outcomes cognitively—understanding conversion rates and strategic implications—yet keep their own behavior stable, cooperative, and low-intervention, intervening with punishment only once when a clear, group-endorsed target emerges."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is predominantly a high contributor who publicly commits to maximal contributions and usually follows through, but occasionally and quietly deviates to free‑ride. Their baseline is to treat full contribution as the “default” and they explicitly state an intention to always contribute the maximum. For much of the game they behave consistently with this declared norm, even when others under‑contribute and even when the interaction becomes long and tedious. They do not condition their contributions strongly on others’ behavior in a fine‑grained way; they continue to give the maximum through stretches where some players repeatedly give zero, suggesting they prioritize maintaining the cooperative norm over short‑term payoff optimization.\n\nHowever, they intermittently switch to contributing nothing on a small subset of rounds, without announcing any change of intention. These free‑ride episodes do not map clearly onto a single trigger like being punished, a sudden collapse of contributions, or a clear end‑game signal; instead, they appear sporadic. This pattern looks less like a systematic conditional cooperator and more like a primarily cooperative type who occasionally tests or exploits the group while trying not to become the obvious villain. They experience punishment for low contributions but do not openly react or adjust their stated stance; instead they quietly return to high contributions afterwards.\n\nOverall, they show relatively low risk aversion regarding group outcomes: they keep contributing maximally even when the group is visibly frustrated and some defectors persist, implying they either accept the lower earnings as the cost of fairness/cooperation or place weight on maintaining an image (to themselves or the “group”) of being a team player. Their norm of fairness seems to be “everyone should contribute the maximum,” but they tolerate their own rare deviations without self‑justification or explanation, suggesting some internal conflict or opportunism rather than a rigid moral rule.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThe player is low‑frequency and low‑intensity in communication. They speak rarely, and when they do, it is short and socially aligned with the majority. Early on, they affirm cooperation by briefly reporting that they are contributing the maximum and later explicitly pledge to do so every time. They do not take a leadership role in explaining the game, organizing punishment, or diagnosing under‑contributors. Instead, they allow others (especially more vocal cooperators) to handle coordination and norm enforcement, while they signal agreement from the sidelines.\n\nTheir tone is friendly and lightly humorous. They do not confront defectors, complain about others, or participate in calling out specific low contributors. When the study drags on and others express boredom and frustration, they do not join the complaints in a hostile way; instead, at one point they make a pop‑culture joke comparing the drawn‑out nature of the task to a high‑stakes survival scenario, indicating mild frustration but wrapped in humor rather than anger. Near the end, they offer a brief hopeful remark, signaling engagement and shared desire for the task to finish, but again without directing blame.\n\nThey appear responsive to the overall group mood rather than to specific individuals. When others are enthusiastic about cooperation, they publicly align with that sentiment; when the chat shifts to complaining about length and payment, they join that topic lightly, not to organize resistance but to express that they share the experience. They never argue, never defend themselves against punishment, and never challenge accusations that could in principle apply to them; instead they remain socially “smooth,” avoiding conflict and minimizing their visibility. Their style is cooperative, affiliative, and slightly detached: they want to be seen as part of the cooperative in‑group but are not invested in steering the group’s behavior.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThis player never spends any coins on punishment, despite persistent under‑contribution by some others and despite a norm of sanctioning zero contributors that several players adopt and discuss. Even when free‑riding increases and punishment of defectors is openly coordinated in the chat, they abstain from participating. This holds both when they are contributing fully (and would have standard altruistic‑punisher motives available) and when they themselves are low‑contributing (in which case strategic or retaliatory punishment might be expected). Their consistent non‑use suggests either a principled aversion to costly sanctions, a strong focus on maximizing their own payoff, or simple inertia and low engagement with the punishment stage.\n\nWhen they themselves are punished after free‑riding, they do not comment, complain, or signal any resentment. They neither retaliate nor attempt to negotiate or justify their behavior. Instead, they quietly adjust their contribution back toward the cooperative norm in subsequent play, but still without enforcing that norm on others. This behavior is more consistent with someone who accepts punishment as “part of the game” or not worth engaging over, rather than someone who is concerned with fairness in the sense of “wrongdoing must be sanctioned.”\n\nFunctionally, their stance is: contribute a lot, rarely defect, but almost never invest in enforcement. They rely on others to bear the cost of punishing free‑riders and benefit from that enforcement when it increases group contributions, yet they do not reciprocate by punishing themselves. There is no evidence of deterrence‑oriented or norm‑expressive punishment on their part, and no observable retaliatory impulse. Their punishment type is best described as a non‑punishing, norm‑conforming opportunist: they enjoy cooperative gains, occasionally exploit the group, accept being sanctioned, and avoid the costs—material and social—of active enforcement."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a perfectly stable, moderate contributor. They always contribute exactly half of their endowment and never adjust this level despite substantial variation in others’ behavior, total contributions, and final payoffs. Their strategy is simple and rule-like: “I put in a fair, middle amount every time,” with no detectable experimentation or trend over the game. They do not try to match the group’s average, do not escalate to full cooperation when others are highly cooperative, and do not drop toward free-riding when others’ contributions fall. This indicates a strong internal fairness norm anchored at “half,” combined with low reactivity to social or payoff signals. They appear risk-averse with respect to strategy change: once they find a behavior that yields solid payoffs, they stick to it, even though higher contributions would raise group and personal returns given the multiplier. They prioritize steadiness and simplicity over payoff maximization and do not appear to condition their contributions on any specific peer’s behavior.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThis player never uses punishment, despite repeated opportunities and clear variation in others’ contribution levels, including occasional low contributions by peers and visible use of punishment by others. Their inaction persists regardless of whether some players contribute less than the group norm or whether punishment might have been effective at disciplining a specific target. This suggests a strong reluctance to incur personal costs to harm others, even for potential norm enforcement. They do not appear motivated by retaliation, do not mimic others’ punitive strategies, and do not engage in second-order punishment (punishing non-punishers). The pattern is consistent with a non-punitive, harm-averse type that prefers to let the contribution structure “speak for itself” rather than enforcing norms through costly sanctions. Whether this is due to moral discomfort with harming others, skepticism about the effectiveness of punishment, or simple self-interest in avoiding costs remains unknown.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nThis player is never punished during the game, so their direct behavioral response to identifiable punishers is unknown. There is no evidence of pre-emptive adaptation to avoid punishment; their contribution level is unchanging from the start and does not react to others’ sanctioning patterns. Given their stable, moderate contributions and non-punitive stance, if they were punished in a future setting, one might expect low propensity for counter-punishment and a tendency to maintain their own norm-following behavior; however, this is speculative and confidence in this extrapolation is low.\n\n<REWARD>\nThis player never uses rewards, even when others contribute more than they do and when prosocial reward behavior is clearly present in the group. They do not invest to encourage high contributors, nor do they attempt to strategically reinforce allies or cultivate reciprocity. Their stance appears efficiency- and cost-focused at the individual level: they avoid spending coins on mechanisms that transfer payoff away from themselves, even when such transfers could plausibly improve future cooperation. They also show no sign of imitating others’ rewarding behavior. The absence of rewards, combined with steady moderate contributions, fits a “self-contained cooperator” profile: willing to contribute reliably to the public good but not willing to pay extra to manage others’ behavior through positive incentives.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThis player is never rewarded, so their direct reactions to identifiable rewarders are unknown. They do not adjust their contributions in response to the general presence of rewards in the environment; their behavior remains unchanged while others use rewards multiple times. There is no observable attempt to signal for future rewards by increasing contributions, nor any sign of forming implicit alliances with known rewarders. Whether they would reciprocate rewards via higher contributions or via counter-reward in another setting is unknown.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThis player observes substantial information each round: others’ contributions, payoffs, and costs spent on punishment and reward. Yet they display no behavioral adjustment in response. They do not increase contributions when others contribute very high amounts and group payoffs rise, and they do not decrease when others free-ride more or when punitive conflict escalates among others. They ignore both negative and positive incentive signals directed at other players and do not seem to take advantage of apparent “safe” opportunities to free-ride when cooperation stays high. This indicates low sensitivity to social comparison and low engagement with the strategic social dynamics. Their primary focus appears to be on maintaining a personally acceptable, predictable payoff stream rather than tailoring their behavior in response to others’ gains, losses, or enforcement activity. Overall, they behave as a stable, internally guided cooperator who treats others’ outcomes as background information rather than as cues for adaptation."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a flexible, opportunistic contributor who mixes medium cooperation with episodes of near-complete free-riding. They alternate between contributing roughly half of their endowment and contributing almost nothing, with occasional token amounts. Their behavior suggests they want to benefit from the public good without being the worst contributor, and they sometimes match or slightly undercut the prevailing contribution norm rather than either leading cooperation or fully exploiting it.\n\nThey show moderate responsiveness to group behavior: when they are heavily targeted by punishment after low contributions, they reliably jump back up to mid-level contributions in subsequent rounds. When punishment pressure eases, they are willing to return to low or minimal giving, indicating conditional cooperation driven by sanctions more than by an internal fairness norm. They do not insist on perfectly equal contributions; instead, they appear comfortable contributing less than many others as long as punishment risk remains manageable.\n\nTheir risk tolerance is moderate: they do at times take the risk of very low contributions even after previous costly sanctions, but they do not escalate to extreme, consistent defection once they see that sanctions can be severe. Instead they oscillate, suggesting a willingness to “test” how much free-riding is tolerable, then retreat toward the group norm when sanctions become intense.\n\nOverall, this is a sanction-sensitive, strategic free-rider: not a pure defector, but someone who prefers contributing less than cooperative peers and adjusts upward primarily in response to observed costs rather than intrinsic commitment to fairness.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nAwareness of the finite horizon does not produce a simple monotonic decay in cooperation. Instead, the player continues their pattern of alternating between mid-range contributions and very low contributions through the later part of the game. Even very late, they sometimes cooperate at moderate levels and sometimes free-ride, rather than converging on full defection.\n\nSevere punishment episodes near the end are followed immediately by higher, more cooperative contributions, indicating that direct payoff feedback matters more to them than abstract end-game logic. They do not appear to adopt a final-round “grab everything” policy; they are still willing to contribute almost nothing in some late rounds but also still return to medium contributions after that. This suggests that, although they can see how many rounds remain, their horizon awareness is weaker than their short-run response to sanctions.\n\nIn summary, their end-game behavior is best described as continuing sanction-driven conditional cooperation with opportunistic dips, rather than a deliberate backward-induction collapse of contributions.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThis player never uses the punishment mechanism, despite multiple opportunities and despite being a repeated target of costly sanctions themselves. They absorb substantial deductions without retaliating or attempting to discipline low contributors, suggesting a strong reluctance to spend their own resources on norm enforcement.\n\nTheir non-use of punishment persists across cooperative and non-cooperative phases, indicating a stable trait rather than a situational oversight. This aligns with a payoff-maximizing stance toward the second-order public good: they treat punishment as an unnecessary cost, even when it might deter future sanctions against themselves or stabilize cooperation. There is no evidence of anger-driven retaliation, moralistic punishment, or targeted norm enforcement; their motives appear purely first-order (own payoff from contributions and redistributions), not second-order (shaping others’ behavior via punishment).\n\nTheir type is therefore “non-punishing, sanction-sensitive free-rider”: they respond to being punished by adjusting contributions but never themselves invest in punishing others."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a mostly cooperative, mildly opportunistic contributor who appears sensitive to the surrounding norm. They generally align with a high-contribution standard, joining the majority in providing the full endowment to the public good when they see that many others do so. Their pattern suggests a baseline preference to contribute rather than free-ride, but this is not absolute: they are willing to withhold contributions when defection is visibly common and/or when they have recently been treated negatively by others.\n\nThey show conditional cooperation: their decision to contribute seems linked to what they infer about the group’s behavior and attitude toward them. When they feel aligned with the group and not targeted, they cooperate fully. When they feel misaligned—e.g., after being singled out for negative treatment despite not behaving worse than others—they are willing to deviate and keep their endowment. This indicates concern for fairness and reciprocity rather than pure profit maximization or unconditional altruism.\n\nStability is moderate: they do not oscillate randomly, but they do adjust behavior in response to the social environment. They seem willing to bear personal cost to maintain a cooperative norm as long as they perceive the group as fair and non-hostile. Risk tolerance appears moderate as well: they accept exposure to exploitation (by free-riders or punishers) but will test a more self-interested response once that exploitation is salient. They do not, however, escalate into sustained defection; instead, they return to cooperation, implying a default leaning toward prosociality with some guardedness.\n\nOverall, they fit a “conditional cooperator with fairness sensitivity” type: they prefer high contributions, but that preference is contingent on being treated reasonably by others.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThis player entirely abstains from using costly punishment, even when clear free-riders or surprising punishers are present. They do not target low contributors, nor do they respond punitively to those who harmed them. This absence of punishment is consistent and not obviously driven by a lack of opportunity.\n\nTheir non-use of punishment suggests several tendencies:\n- Low inclination toward retaliation, even when directly harmed.\n- Reluctance to invest resources in norm enforcement, despite having visible free-riders.\n- A likely perception that punishment is either too costly, too aggressive, or not worth the effort in this environment.\n\nThey do not engage in selective “moralistic punishment” of defectors, nor in revenge toward whoever imposed costs on them. This hints at either a more tolerant or conflict-avoidant style, or a strategic calculation that punishing under uncertainty (not knowing how many rounds remain, nor seeing others’ payoffs) is inefficient.\n\nRegarding motives, there is no evidence of either deterrence- or retaliation-based punishment: they never use the tool, even when both could be justified from a self- or group-protective perspective. This aligns them with a “non-punishing cooperator” profile—willing to contribute, but not to bear additional cost to sanction others.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nThey experience a substantial deduction at one point, clearly attributable to someone using the punishment mechanism against them, but they do not respond with direct retaliation via punishment. Instead, their next observed response is a temporary shift toward non-contribution. This reveals several things:\n\n- They register punishment and adjust behavior, but the adjustment targets their own contribution rather than the punisher.\n- Their reaction mixes emotional or fairness-related response with strategic adaptation: when punished despite not behaving worse than many peers, they briefly withhold cooperation, as if to withdraw goodwill from a group that appears hostile or unfair.\n- They do not appear vengeful against specific individuals, despite punishers being identifiable. This suggests either self-control, reluctance to escalate conflict, or a focus on their own behavior rather than targeting others.\n\nForgiveness is partial: they do not retaliate, and they ultimately resume cooperative contributions, indicating they do not hold a lasting grudge strong enough to cement long-term defection. However, the temporary defection shows they are not fully compliant either; they are willing to “push back” against perceived unfair treatment by lowering their own contributions.\n\nIn sum, their response to being punished is non-retaliatory but not submissive: they briefly reduce cooperation to signal or act on their discontent, then revert to their cooperative baseline.\n\n<REWARD>\nThe player has access to a reward mechanism and receives rewards themselves, yet never uses rewards on others. This consistent inaction suggests a reluctance to spend personal resources to positively reinforce even clear high contributors.\n\nPossible interpretations, all somewhat speculative:\n- They may see reward as too inefficient or costly, given the conversion rate.\n- They may believe that cooperation is already sufficiently established and doesn’t need additional reinforcement.\n- They may be more self-focused in the use of side mechanisms, reserving resources rather than investing in others’ payoffs.\n\nWhat is clearer is that they are not a “rewarding cooperator” type: they contribute to the public good but do not supplement that with positive incentives. This differentiates them from “strong reciprocators” who both cooperate and actively reward cooperators. Their stance is more minimal: they cooperate directly but do not pay extra for social engineering.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThey are rewarded at least twice and can clearly see that someone chose to benefit them, yet they offer no return reward. They also do not change their use of the reward mechanism after being rewarded; it remains inactive. Their contribution behavior following rewards is cooperative, but this was already characteristic of them except during the period following punishment.\n\nThis indicates:\n- They do not engage in explicit reciprocity via reward tools, even when a clear opportunity for alliance-building or gratitude signaling exists.\n- Their gratitude, if present, is not expressed through costly reward; instead, their cooperative contribution pattern continues more or less as before.\n- They do not appear to adopt a targeted “you rewarded me, I’ll reward you” exchange strategy in this environment.\n\nThus, their response to being rewarded is passive: they accept the benefit, maintain or resume cooperative contributions, but do not invest in reinforcing or reciprocating toward the rewarder specifically. This places them in a type that values cooperation and is somewhat responsive to group treatment in their own contribution decisions, but that largely ignores the second-order tools of interpersonal sanctioning and rewarding."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player consistently chooses the fully cooperative option even when others sometimes withhold. There is no evidence of conditional cooperation or adjustments in response to marginal changes in group behavior; contributions remain maximally pro-social throughout. The player appears to follow a strong norm of full contribution rather than a tit-for-tat or proportional strategy. They accept the individual risk that others may free-ride and do not show observable attempts to hedge against exploitation. Their behavior is compatible with a “principled cooperator” type who values the public good and/or adherence to a cooperative rule more than short-term payoff optimization. Whether this is driven by fairness, morality, or experiment-mindedness is unknown.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThe player is generally reluctant to use punishment and does so only once, and not against those who most clearly under-contribute. The target they select is a peer who is contributing fully at the time, while several others are free-riding. This indicates that their punishment is not straightforwardly aimed at deterring low contribution or enforcing a simple fairness norm. The motive behind this isolated punishment is ambiguous: it could be a mistaken click, confusion about the interface, an attempt to test the mechanism, or a delayed/opaque response to earlier behavior; all of these interpretations are low confidence. They never escalate into systematic sanctioning and do not punish multiple low contributors despite repeated opportunities, suggesting no strong inclination toward consistent norm enforcement or retaliation. Overall, they are best characterized as an inconsistent or experimental punisher rather than a dedicated enforcer.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nThe player is punished once by another identifiable participant and does not respond with any observable retaliation. After being punished, they maintain full contributions and do not punish the punisher or expand punishment to others. There is no sign that being targeted reduces their willingness to cooperate or induces a counter-punishment cycle. This suggests a relatively non-reactive or forgiving stance toward sanctions, or at least a decision not to use punishment as a response tool. Whether they internally update their beliefs about others’ intentions or feel wronged is unknown; outwardly, they remain cooperative and restraint-oriented in the face of negative treatment.\n\n<REWARD>\nThe player uses rewards multiple times and never abandons this option entirely. They direct rewards toward individuals who contribute nothing in the public good stage, not toward clear cooperators. This pattern is inconsistent with standard positive reciprocity or straightforward reinforcement of high contributions. Possible, low-confidence interpretations include: attempting to encourage or “pull in” low contributors via positive incentives; experimenting with the reward technology; or misinterpreting the payoff structure. They keep rewarding even when the same target continues to free-ride, indicating either persistence in a “convert the defector” approach or indifference to immediate effectiveness. Later, they shift reward to a different low contributor rather than to reliable cooperators, reinforcing the pattern of favoring laggards over contributors. Overall, they appear willing to incur personal cost to transfer resources to others, with an unusual focus on under-contributors rather than allies.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThe player is positively rewarded by others at least once but does not reciprocate directly to those apparent allies. They do not create a mutual-reward loop with their benefactor; their own reward allocations remain focused on different targets. Receiving reward does not change their all-in cooperative contribution pattern, which is already maximally cooperative, nor does it redirect their social transfers toward reciprocation. This suggests that, behaviorally, they are relatively insensitive to positive incentives in terms of alliance-building or targeted reciprocity. They seem to maintain their own idiosyncratic reward strategy regardless of who supports them. Whether they feel gratitude internally or update trust toward rewarders is unknown; their observable strategy remains principled and self-directed rather than reciprocally oriented."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a volatile, strategically experimental contributor rather than a stable cooperator or pure free‑rider. They never fix on a single norm: their contributions range from zero to the maximum, with many intermediate values. Early on they undercontribute relative to a strong “all max” norm, then sometimes match the group’s high contributions, sometimes contribute clearly less, and occasionally almost nothing while still benefiting from others’ cooperation.\n\nTheir behavior suggests:\n- They understand that others are mostly contributing the maximum and that this yields high payoffs, but they do not feel bound to that norm.\n- They are willing to free‑ride in some rounds even when everyone else is at maximum, and they tolerate being punished for this.\n- They are not purely money‑maximizing either: they sometimes contribute close to the maximum even after being heavily punished, and later in the game they continue to sacrifice payoff heavily via rewards and occasional punishment.\n\nThey do not make explicit fairness claims, but their pattern shows little regard for “equal treatment for equal contribution.” They repeatedly put themselves in a position where they are the unique or clear outlier and accept that this draws collective punishment. Their risk tolerance is high: they knowingly choose contribution levels that are likely to provoke sanctions, and they continue to do so even after extremely costly deductions.\n\nOverall, this looks like a “playful, high‑variance strategist” who treats contribution choices as part of a broader experiment (including punishment/reward use), not as a fixed moral or efficiency rule.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThey communicate sparingly but purposefully. Early on they agree briefly with the group’s “all contribute max” coordination line, using a short affirmative response. They do not try to lead or persuade; they mostly observe the rich ongoing conversation among others (especially the very talkative players) and occasionally interject.\n\nTheir tone is light and somewhat detached. They never complain about being punished or about low earnings, and they never protest when they are targeted. When they speak later in the game, their messages are short, often reacting with humor (e.g., responding with “lol” to the discussion about region and the game’s length, or confirming the long duration at the end). They do not justify their own unusual behavior, do not explain their reward choices, and do not defend themselves when others discuss them as a “bot” or as suspicious; they simply remain silent.\n\nThey are clearly reading chat carefully—later, other players notice detailed aspects of their behavior (rewards, deductions), and the focal player adjusts some behaviors in ways that suggest awareness—but they choose not to use chat to coordinate or to manage their own reputation. This is an engagement style of “quiet observer/experimenter”: highly attentive, minimally expressive, and not seeking social approval.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey are willing to punish, but they do so selectively and with a distinctive profile:\n\n- Early on, they punish clear low contributors and non‑compliers, aligning with the group’s justice norm. This includes punishing two obvious deviators in the first round.\n- They also join group campaigns against a recurrent norm‑breaker: they punish the chronic zero‑contributor once, adding to the pile‑on.\n- Later, they punish an otherwise highly cooperative player who has just been randomly punished by the group’s “angry bird” narrative target, even though that player’s contributions have been consistently maximal. This choice is not driven by contribution levels or by direct harm from that player.\n\nPunishment is relatively infrequent compared to how often they use rewards, but when they do punish it is not purely deterrent: they sometimes side with group justice against norm violators, and other times they appear to “twist the knife” on a high contributor who has just been victimized, making that player worse off while the group is framing them as innocent. This indicates a willingness to exploit ambiguity in social narratives.\n\nThey never use punishment to retaliate for punishment they themselves receive, despite being heavily and repeatedly sanctioned. They do not try to deter others from punishing them. That suggests they treat punishment more as an experimental tool and a lever on the group’s emotional dynamics than as self‑protective retaliation.\n\nIn a new environment, expect them to punish occasionally, especially clear defectors or salient targets singled out by group talk, but not to be a consistent norm enforcer. They can also direct punishment in ways that seem arbitrary or strategically opaque from others’ perspective.\n\n<REWARD>\nReward is their main “signature.” They spend a very large amount of coins over the game on rewards, far more than most players, and they accept substantial personal losses to do it—even to the point of negative or near‑zero payoffs in several rounds. This is not payoff‑maximizing under the given reward technology.\n\nTheir reward pattern reveals several traits:\n\n- They frequently reward full cooperators who stay aligned with the group norm, especially players who are active in chat or central to coordination.\n- They repeatedly reward a few specific players across many rounds (for example, one consistently high‑contributing player gets rewarded multiple times), suggesting long‑term “pet” relationships or intentional signaling.\n- They also reward players who have just been punished or are socially salient in the discussion, sometimes right after the group focuses on them, as if to counterbalance or to shape perceptions.\n- There is no simple “reward only high contributors and punish low contributors” rule. They reward a mix of central talkers, norm enforcers, and occasionally quiet high contributors, but not systematically all of them.\n\nGiven that rewards are inefficient (costlier than the benefit they give), their heavy use of them shows that they are not simply maximizing their own final bonus. Instead, they are exploring how rewards shape others’ beliefs: other players openly speculate about who the “angry bird” is rewarding, and some infer that they are being rewarded for having “figured out” the bird’s identity. This indicates the focal player is comfortable using rewards as opaque signals, not necessarily to reinforce contribution norms but to create intrigue and uncertainty.\n\nIn a new PGG, this type tends to be a “mysterious benefactor”: willing to burn resources to grant small rewards, with criteria that mix contribution, social engagement, and narrative interest rather than pure efficiency.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThe focal player shows a striking indifference to their own monetary outcomes and to punitive attacks on them, while being acutely aware of others’ outcomes:\n\n- They repeatedly accept extremely large net negative or near‑zero round payoffs due to others’ punishment of them and their own reward spending, but never express frustration or attempt to correct others’ perceptions in chat.\n- They do, however, track who is gaining and losing: they recognize which players are being punished or rewarded by others and often respond by rewarding those same players, exacerbating or offsetting social signals.\n- When an otherwise cooperative player is hit by arbitrary group punishment, they sometimes join in punishing that player further rather than defending them, which suggests they are more interested in the dynamics of sanction cascades than in restoring fairness.\n\nOver time, the group develops a strong narrative that the focal player is a bot or a researcher avatar. The focal player notices this (they’re explicitly named and discussed), but their behavior remains consistent: heavy reward use, variable contributions, and no verbal defense. They do not adjust to restore trust; instead, they continue to generate patterns that others will find puzzling.\n\nThey do respond weakly to meta‑information: after the group clarifies the monetary conversion and expresses concern about wasting coins, their contributions and reward intensity sometimes shift toward more moderate or maximal contributions, but they still choose some highly costly reward bursts afterward. This suggests their primary objective is not strictly to maximize money, even once the value of coins is known.\n\nIn a new PGG, this player type:\n- Tracks the social consequences of outcomes keenly but is not personally deterred by losses.\n- Uses others’ outcomes (especially being punished or discussed) as cues for where to direct rewards or occasional punishment.\n- Treats the game as an experiment in social signaling and group psychology rather than primarily as a payoff‑maximization task."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a high, near-unconditional contributor for most of the game. They usually give the full endowment and appear to treat full contribution as the “default” cooperative norm, even when others’ average contributions fluctuate and sometimes fall well below their own. Their behavior suggests they value sustaining group cooperation and are willing to accept personal payoff risk to do so. \n\nThey do not perfectly follow a “simple conditional cooperator” pattern; they continue contributing fully through periods when average contributions drop and when some group members repeatedly free-ride. However, they are not completely rigid. Mid- and late-game, they introduce a few lower contributions, including one sharp reduction, which indicates some sensitivity to the emerging norm and to the diminishing horizon. These deviations are limited and do not escalate into systematic defection; instead, they look like occasional payoff-protecting moves rather than a full abandonment of cooperation.\n\nOverall, they hold a strong fairness/cooperation norm, tolerate substantial exploitation for many rounds, and only modestly adjust downward when group contributions and the end-game timing make full cooperation less attractive.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThe player is clearly aware of the finite horizon and allows it to influence contribution decisions, but only in a restrained way. Near the end, they reduce contributions in some rounds while still maintaining at least moderate giving and even returning to full contribution in the penultimate round. In the final round, they contribute minimally, consistent with standard end-game defection logic. \n\nThis pattern suggests they balance two motives: maximizing final earnings and maintaining a cooperative identity. They do not “unravel” cooperation early; instead, they hold high contributions until late and then selectively defect at the very end, when future reciprocity is impossible. The presence of occasional earlier reductions indicates that they also react to accumulating evidence of others’ opportunism and to decaying overall cooperation, but they do not drive that decay.\n\n<REWARD>\nThe player never pays to reward anyone, despite having repeated opportunities and clearly observable cooperative peers. This is stable across early, middle, and late rounds. Their restraint is not driven by lack of cooperative partners: several group members contribute highly and are actively rewarding others, yet the player still refrains from spending.\n\nGiven that each reward unit is payoff-neutral by design, their refusal to reward indicates a strong cost-avoidance or frugality norm regarding “extra” prosocial expenditures, rather than a misunderstanding of the mechanism. They appear to treat contribution as their main cooperative lever and are unwilling to incur additional direct costs, even to support high contributors or to solidify alliances.\n\nThey therefore exhibit a “cooperative but non-rewarding” type: they provide the public good generously but do not invest in formal positive reciprocity mechanisms.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThe player receives rewards in many rounds, often from consistent high-contribution rewarders, but they never reciprocate with reward. There is no evidence of targeted payback to those who reward them, nor of strategic alliance-building via mutual reward exchange. Their contributions remain high regardless of who rewarded them, indicating that they do not condition their giving on being personally recognized or favored.\n\nThis pattern points to weak or absent gratitude signaling through the available reward channel. If gratitude or appreciation exists, it does not translate into costly reciprocation. Instead, they maintain a largely one-dimensional cooperative strategy: contribute a lot, ignore the reward system as an active tool, and continue cooperating independently of whether specific others treat them well. This is consistent with a principled or norm-based cooperator who is behaviorally stubborn and not very relationally strategic.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThe player observes wide variation in others’ contributions, reward spending, and payoffs. They see some players spend heavily on rewards, some systematically reward high contributors, and others free-ride or sharply reduce contributions. Despite this, they show minimal behavioral reactivity in either direction. High reward expenditures by peers do not inspire them to start rewarding, and persistent low contributions by certain members only gradually and mildly reduce their own contributions, mostly later in the game.\n\nThey also witness others burning considerable payoff on rewarding, sometimes inefficiently, yet they do not imitate this pattern. This suggests they infer that such spending is not necessary for their own objectives. They appear payoff-conscious with respect to side-payments: they let others bear the extra cost of “policing” or reinforcing cooperation while they stick to contribution decisions alone.\n\nTaken together, the player seems to interpret others’ outcomes and choices mainly as a loose signal about the group’s cooperative climate—adjusting contributions slightly when overall cooperation erodes and the end approaches—but does not engage in fine-grained, actor-specific responses. Their type is that of a robust, norm-driven high contributor who is strategically cautious about additional costs, relatively indifferent to the social signaling and alliance benefits of rewards, and only modestly adaptive to others’ evolving behavior."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a generally high contributor who leans cooperative even when others free‑ride. They often give close to or at the full endowment, with only occasional reductions. These lower contributions appear more like mild shading in response to deteriorating group cooperation or end‑game position than a switch to full free‑riding. They do not match others’ low contributions closely; instead, they maintain contributions above the group’s minimum tendency, suggesting an internal norm of “should contribute fairly a lot” rather than strict payoff maximization. Their behavior indicates moderate risk tolerance: they keep contributing substantially despite weak assurance that others will do the same. Conditionality is present but soft—when the public contribution level drops or becomes erratic, they reduce somewhat, yet they never exploit very high group contributions by sharply under‑contributing. Fairness norms seem pro‑social: they appear more willing to risk being the sucker than to risk dragging the public good down.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nAwareness of the finite horizon does not trigger a collapse to zero cooperation. In later rounds, they do trim contributions relative to their own earlier highs, but they remain a positive contributor even when others start dropping. This pattern suggests that the player understands that payoffs are declining and cooperation is becoming less reliable, yet they continue to treat the interaction as worth sustaining. There is no strong last‑round defection spike; instead they end with a moderate contribution when many others severely cut back or drop to near zero. This implies that they either discount backward‑induction logic or prioritize norm consistency and “how I play” over strict end‑game payoff optimization. Their behavior is consistent with someone who values maintaining a cooperative identity through to the end more than squeezing out maximal final‑round earnings.\n\n<REWARD>\nThis player is a very heavy and persistent rewarder. They spend substantial portions of their payoff on rewarding others across many rounds, often at levels that noticeably erode their own earnings. They continue to reward even when returns to doing so are weak or one‑sided from the standpoint of their own payoffs. The triggers for reward are primarily prosocial behavior: they direct rewards most strongly toward high or reliable contributors and seldom, if ever, toward very low contributors. They appear to target players who either consistently support the public good or who step up in otherwise low‑contribution environments. The pattern indicates that they use reward as a normative signal rather than as a tightly optimized investment. They seem willing to “overpay” to support or encourage cooperators, and they maintain this generosity through both good and bad contribution climates. There is no evidence of them withdrawing rewards in systematic retaliation for low contributions; instead, they tend to simply omit reward for weak contributors rather than spending strategically to reshape them.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nWhen others reward them, they do not strongly pivot their strategy toward direct reciprocity. Though they do receive rewards from several peers, there is no clear pattern of them selectively increasing reward back to those same individuals relative to similarly cooperative others. Their reward behavior remains broad‑based and anchored more on contribution patterns than on who has personally transferred coins to them. This points to low emphasis on personalized alliances or tit‑for‑tat relationships and higher emphasis on group‑level norms. Being rewarded does not induce extreme shifts in their own contribution levels, suggesting that they see rewards more as confirmation that cooperation is valued than as contingent bargains that must be immediately repaid. If they ever do reciprocate specific rewarders more than others, it is subtle and not systematic enough to infer confidently. Overall, they behave more like a principled prosocial rewarder than a coalition‑builder or reputation trader.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey track others’ contributions and outcomes and respond in ways that prioritize supporting high contributors and visible cooperators. Players whose payoffs are high because they both contribute and are rewarded by others often also receive this player’s reward, indicating a tendency to align with perceived “good citizens” of the group. They show little inclination to target players who already earn very high payoffs through low contributions plus others’ generosity; instead, they generally avoid rewarding clear free‑riders, even when those free‑riders’ outcomes are strong. When the overall group payoff environment deteriorates, they pull back slightly on contributions but often continue spending substantially on rewarding the remaining cooperators, implying that they are sensitive to others’ costs and are willing to shore up those who continue to bear a burden for the public good. They appear to accept personally lower payoffs as a consequence of this stance. There is no evidence of spite or envy toward high earners; their adjustments are about contribution behavior, not simply relative income. Consequently, their type is best described as a norm‑driven, inequality‑tolerant cooperator who uses reward as a costly signal of approval and encouragement rather than as a strict instrument of personal gain."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player fits a “hyper-cooperative but erratic reciprocator with occasional free-riding” profile. They are generally willing to contribute fully to the public good and appear to treat full contribution as their default choice. Across the game, they alternate between full cooperation and full defection rather than using intermediate or mixed patterns, suggesting a simple, binary heuristic rather than fine-tuned optimization.\n\nTheir cooperation is not unconditional. They sometimes free-ride even when most others contribute fully, showing that they do not rigidly follow a fairness or equality norm. They appear comfortable benefiting from others’ contributions without always matching them, especially after periods of intense rewarding, which indicates some sensitivity to their own payoff or fatigue with bearing multiple costs at once.\n\nAt the same time, they repeatedly return to full contribution after free-riding episodes, even when the group includes some consistent non-contributors. This tendency indicates a strong underlying cooperative inclination and relatively high tolerance for being exploited. They are not strongly deterrable by the presence of defectors; they seem oriented toward sustaining group cooperation rather than strictly protecting themselves.\n\nTheir behavior suggests limited conditionality: they do not finely track who is cooperative versus not, and they do not sharply reduce contributions in direct proportion to defection. Instead, they seem to use coarse adjustments: periods of sustained full cooperation, occasional switches to full free-riding, then reversion to cooperation. This pattern is consistent with a player who values cooperation and the public good but is also somewhat impulsive or experimental, occasionally testing free-riding or taking payoff relief after high-cost rewarding episodes.\n\nRisk-wise, they exhibit a moderate willingness to accept potential exploitation: they often contribute fully in groups with visible defectors and without any punishment mechanism, implying that they either expect enough others to cooperate to make contribution attractive or that they intrinsically prefer the cooperative action even under uncertainty. However, free-riding intervals show they are not purely idealistic; they are aware of and sometimes act on the individual incentive to keep their endowment.\n\nOverall, they are a high-cooperation, somewhat volatile contributor who oscillates between pro-social commitment and opportunistic relief, but without a strong, precise contingent strategy.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThe player shows no clear evidence of classic end-game defection. They continue to employ full contributions through the final stretch of the game and do not shift into a systematic “last-round” free-riding mode. In the final rounds, they remain willing to contribute fully even when others are not all cooperating, suggesting that horizon effects do not strongly undermine their cooperative tendency.\n\nThere is some fluctuation near the end, but it does not follow a simple “cooperation collapses as the end approaches” pattern. Instead, they mix both contributing and free-riding late in the game while still returning to full cooperation in the very last round. This indicates that they either do not rely on backward-induction style reasoning, do not prioritize it, or prioritize other motives such as maintaining a cooperative identity or reinforcing norms independently of future payoffs.\n\nThey appear aware that the game has a finite horizon (the interface reveals remaining rounds), but their actions imply that this awareness does not dominate their behavior. Rather than conserving resources or exploiting the final stage, they remain willing to incur cooperative costs at the end. This is consistent with a type who values cooperation as a default stance and is less driven by strictly forward-looking payoff maximization as the game concludes.\n\n<REWARD>\nThis player is an extremely heavy and sometimes extreme user of the reward mechanism. They are clearly willing to spend substantial personal resources to provide rewards to peers, even at the cost of very low or negative round payoffs. This behavior signals strong pro-social or norm-enforcement motives that can override short-term self-interest.\n\nTheir rewarding is broadly directed toward cooperators rather than defectors. They do not appear to systematically reward non-contributors; instead, they seem to reward those who contribute to the public good, attempting to reinforce and encourage cooperative behavior. The amounts they spend on rewards vary widely: in some rounds they give nothing, while in others they invest heavily. This variation suggests a reactive or emotional component—when they perceive cooperative patterns they particularly like, they may respond with bursts of generous rewarding.\n\nThey do not appear to use rewards in a narrowly strategic, profit-maximizing way. Given the reward technology, modest levels of rewarding could already provide positive externalities at reasonable cost, but the player sometimes overshoots, spending far more than is necessary to send a cooperative signal or secure a marginal gain. This behavior is consistent with a “pro-social enthusiast” or “over-committed rewarder” type, who prioritizes supporting cooperators and promoting group welfare over their own monetary outcomes.\n\nThe player also appears somewhat responsive to receiving rewards themselves: after rounds in which they are rewarded, they frequently maintain or resume full cooperation and sometimes also engage in more rewarding. This pattern suggests that they internalize reward as affirmation and may participate in a cycle of mutual reinforcement—cooperation plus reward leading to more cooperation and more reward. However, because they also reward heavily even when their own payoff is harmed, their rewarding is not purely reciprocal; it is partially unconditional and driven by a desire to foster a cooperative environment in general.\n\nIn summary, they are a strong and at times excessive positive reciprocator: they use rewards primarily as a tool to support and encourage cooperative behavior, are willing to incur large personal costs to do so, and do not finely optimize the deployment of rewards for personal gain."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a highly cooperative, near-unconditional full contributor. They overwhelmingly choose to contribute their entire endowment rather than free-ride, with only a single observed deviation where they keep their endowment. That lone deviation does not launch a new pattern; they immediately revert to full contributions thereafter. This suggests their primary “default” is to cooperate rather than to exploit.\n\nTheir behavior shows only weak conditionality: contributions remain high whether the group’s average is slightly lower or higher, and whether some peers free-ride or not. They do not visibly track or mirror specific peers; instead they appear to anchor on a personal norm of contributing fully to the public good. This implies a fairness or efficiency norm that values maximizing group returns even when others are uneven contributors.\n\nThey accept the strategic risk that others might exploit their generosity. The payoff structure makes free-riding individually attractive, yet they rarely do so, which indicates a willingness to sacrifice some personal security for cooperative outcomes. The isolated non-contribution can be interpreted as a brief test of the payoffs or a momentary experiment, not as evidence of a shift to self-interest, since it is not repeated.\n\nOverall, this player fits a “principled cooperator with high tolerance for imperfect group behavior”: they keep contributing even when some free-riding is visible, and they do not seem to react strongly to minor fluctuations in group cooperation.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThere is no pronounced end-game collapse in their cooperation. They maintain full contributions through the final rounds instead of switching to systematic free-riding as the horizon approaches. The single non-contribution occurs in the late game but is immediately followed by a return to full cooperation; thus it does not function as a classic “last-period” defection pattern.\n\nThis suggests that they either (a) do not rely on backward induction to justify defecting near the end, (b) deliberately reject end-game logic in favor of a stable cooperative identity, or (c) attend more to their own norm than to the finite horizon. The fact that they fully cooperate in the very last round indicates that horizon awareness does not dominate their behavior; if they are aware of the remaining rounds, they still choose to act as a cooperator rather than to exploit the lack of future consequences.\n\nThe end-game pattern therefore points to a type who is norm-driven or habit-driven rather than purely outcome-driven. They do not strategically unwind their cooperation even when, from a narrow monetary standpoint, that would be individually optimal.\n\n<REWARD>\nThis player never spends resources on rewarding others, despite having many opportunities and often sitting in cooperative groups where reward could further reinforce prosocial behavior. At the same time, they repeatedly receive reward units from others, sometimes in substantial amounts. They accept these benefits but do not reciprocate through the mechanism provided.\n\nFrom this pattern, it appears they separate cooperation from social reinforcement: they are willing to incur the cost of contributing to the public good itself but are unwilling to incur the additional cost of meta-cooperation via reward. They might see direct contribution as the “proper” channel for helping the group and view reward as unnecessary, inefficient, or strategically opaque—especially given that rewarders and recipients are anonymous and they cannot target specific individuals based on behavior.\n\nTheir lack of rewarding does not change even when they are the target of generous rewards, suggesting that gratitude, if present, does not translate into costly reciprocal reward-giving. They also do not use the reward mechanism as a tool to shape others’ contributions; there is no observed attempt at strategic reinforcement. Overall, they are a pure contributor rather than a “social enforcer”: they invest in the public good itself but abstain from second-order cooperation via rewards."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a steadfast, unconditional cooperator. They always contribute their full endowment and never deviate, regardless of how much others give or how cooperation fluctuates in the group. Their contribution pattern is extremely stable and shows no evidence of conditionality on others’ behavior; they do not reduce their own giving even when free-riding is present or when overall group contributions drop. They appear to follow a strong internal norm that “one should contribute,” rather than responding to short-term payoff incentives, which would favor keeping the endowment. This suggests a high valuation of group efficiency and public-good provision, along with either low sensitivity to exploitation or a willingness to tolerate it. They accept the risk of being the consistent contributor in a mixed group, prioritizing the social optimum over personal earnings. Fairness, in their behavior, is not enforced by matching others but by persistently doing what they treat as the cooperative baseline, independent of what others do.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nAwareness of the finite horizon does not reduce their cooperation; they maintain full contributions until the very last round, with no sign of end-game decay. Instead of “unraveling” as the end approaches, they continue to behave as they have all game. If anything, they become more active with the reward tool toward the end, suggesting that they think about the closing rounds as opportunities to reinforce or recognize cooperation rather than to exploit others. There is no observable shift toward self-serving behavior in the final rounds. This indicates that they either do not reason in a backward-induction, payoff-maximizing way, or they deliberately reject that logic in favor of consistent cooperative principles. Their horizon awareness seems to increase their use of social tools (reward) rather than change their core contribution strategy.\n\n<REWARD>\nThis player is an active, sometimes heavy, rewarder who uses reward as a cooperative reinforcement tool rather than as a precise, efficiency-focused investment. They repeatedly spend substantial portions of their available payoff on rewarding others, including in situations where group cooperation is already high and where the personal cost of rewarding is significant. Their willingness to pay for others to benefit is strong and persists even when the direct financial return from doing so is uncertain or low. They do not appear to use reward in a tightly calibrated, strategic way aimed at maximizing their own future earnings; instead, their pattern fits a prosocial or norm-enforcing style, aiming to support or encourage contributors. They do not systematically withhold reward when others free-ride, but the available data do not reveal how they target specific players, so the exact trigger rules and recipient selection are unknown. Late in the game, they are willing to increase reward spending rather than conserve resources, implying that they treat reward as an expression of cooperative commitment or appreciation rather than a long-run investment tool. Overall, they behave like a principled cooperator who is prepared to incur personal costs to sustain or recognize contributions by others."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThe player is a moderately prosocial but self-oriented conditional cooperator with high volatility. They do not anchor on a single contribution level; instead, they frequently shift between very low and very high contributions. They clearly understand that contributing can be profitable when others also contribute, because they repeatedly choose high contributions in environments where group contributions appear strong. At the same time, they are comfortable free-riding and sometimes take the full endowment while still benefiting from others’ cooperation.\n\nTheir contributions track the perceived cooperativeness of the group in a broad, qualitative way: when others as a whole appear generous, the player is generally willing to join in, though rarely as the most altruistic member. When the group seems more mixed or deteriorating, they reduce their own contribution sharply, sometimes down to zero, even if cooperation has not completely collapsed. They do not insist on strict equality or fairness; they tolerate contributing more than many low contributors around them at times, and at other times they themselves are among the least generous while others are still contributing substantially. This suggests weak or flexible fairness norms: they care about payoff-relevant conditions (is it lucrative to contribute now?) more than about matching others exactly.\n\nRisk-wise, the player shows a willingness to “gamble” on high contributions when the environment looks cooperative, accepting the immediate personal sacrifice for the expectation of a good group return. However, they do not sustain high contributions unconditionally. Their pattern indicates a payoff-sensitive, opportunistic stance rather than a principled commitment to cooperation or a strict free-riding strategy.\n\nOverall, they are a payoff-oriented conditional cooperator: willing to support the public good when it seems profitable and somewhat socially supported, but quick to scale back and free-ride when they sense fragility or unevenness in group contributions. Their strategy is adaptive rather than rigid, but also noisy and inconsistent, suggesting that they update heuristically rather than following a clear, stable rule.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThe player appears aware that the game has a finite horizon, but they do not exhibit a simple linear decay or a pure “end-spurt” of defection. In the final portion of the game, they continue to vary their contributions, sometimes contributing very little and sometimes at moderate-to-high levels. They do not switch into a pure defector mode in the last few rounds, nor do they escalate to full cooperation as a final gesture.\n\nInstead, their late-game behavior remains conditional and opportunistic: they adjust contributions up when the group as a whole still looks reasonably cooperative, and they reduce them when the environment seems more mixed or deteriorating, even very close to the final round. This implies that, even when the end is near, their primary reference remains the current cooperative climate and expected payoff, not a strict backward-induction logic or a moral norm about “finishing strong.”\n\nIn short, their end-game strategy continues the same pattern as earlier: flexible conditional cooperation with intermittent free-riding, rather than a clear terminal collapse or a final cooperative surge."

They use only the extreme options (all or nothing) and switch multiple times rather than locking into a stable pattern. They are willing to contribute fully when they perceive a cooperative or mostly cooperative environment, especially when others’ behavior appears predictable or when full contribution seems likely to be matched by most peers. They also exploit highly cooperative phases by free-riding, taking the entire endowment while others continue to contribute, indicating a readiness to prioritize personal payoff over strict fairness.\n\nTheir contributions are clearly conditional on recent group behavior: they tend to increase or maintain high contributions when they see widespread or unanimous cooperation, and they are more likely to drop to zero when cooperation looks spotty, uneven, or declining. However, they do not strictly punish defectors by defecting in every mixed situation; they sometimes continue to contribute despite seeing non-cooperation from at least one peer, suggesting some tolerance for partial free-riding or a hope that ongoing cooperation will stabilize or resume.\n\nFairness norms appear flexible. The player sometimes accepts an outcome where they pay more than at least one other group member and keeps contributing, which points to either a weak inequality aversion or a belief that maintaining group returns is more important than immediate payoff parity. At other times, they opportunistically free-ride when others are fully cooperative, implying they are comfortable benefiting from others’ contributions when the opportunity is salient.\n\nThey demonstrate some risk tolerance around cooperation: they are willing to invest everything into the public fund even when it is not guaranteed that everyone else will do the same, but they also hedge by reverting to defection after disappointing returns or low group contributions. Across the game, this produces a persona that is neither a pure cooperator nor a pure defector, but a payoff-sensitive, adaptive contributor who oscillates between full cooperation and full defection in response to perceived group norms and recent payoffs."

They do not follow a simple monotone trend; instead, they alternate between contributing nothing, half, or all of their endowment, in patterns that appear responsive to the general cooperation climate rather than random.\n\nWhen the group’s overall contribution level appears strong and stable, the player is willing to contribute heavily, including full contributions. They also sometimes add medium contributions, suggesting they are not locked into “all or nothing” but treat contribution as a tunable lever. However, they repeatedly exploit cooperative phases by dropping to zero while others keep contributing, capturing high payoffs. This shows a willingness to free-ride opportunistically when they expect others to maintain contributions.\n\nThey appear to track the general level of group cooperation: they increase contributions after seeing high and widespread giving, and reduce them when they perceive weaker or more fragmented cooperation. Their behavior is consistent with a player who values efficiency and group returns, but only as long as it does not require them to sacrifice too much relative payoff for too long. They are unlikely to be a pure altruist; their repeated zero contributions during cooperative periods suggest they prioritize personal gain over strict fairness.\n\nThey do not exhibit stable fairness norms. Sometimes they match the cooperative mood with generous participation, but they repeatedly accept being a clear beneficiary of others’ generosity with no apparent attempt to “pay back” in a balanced way. This points toward a flexible, payoff-sensitive strategy rather than a strong inequity-averse or reciprocity-driven norm.\n\nRisk tolerance appears moderate to high. They are willing to contribute fully when they believe others will also contribute, which is risky if others suddenly defect. At the same time, they also hedge by periodically dropping to zero even in good climates, securing guaranteed private payoffs. Overall, they behave like a sophisticated conditional free-rider who uses the group’s cooperative energy but contributes enough to keep the system productive.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThe player is aware of the finite horizon (they can see remaining rounds) and shows a mild but not extreme end-game effect. In the later part of the game, they continue to mix full contributions with full free-riding, rather than sliding monotonically to zero. This indicates they do not follow a strict backward-induction logic of fully defecting as the end approaches.\n\nThey remain willing to make large contributions very near the end, which suggests either a preference for maintaining group efficiency or a belief that others will keep cooperating despite the short horizon. However, they also show opportunistic zero contributions interspersed in the final segment, including in the very last round, which is consistent with exploiting the absence of future punishment or reputation concerns. The last-round zero contribution, after previously showing willingness to give, is a clear sign that when there is no shadow of the future left, they default to self-interested free-riding.\n\nOverall, toward the end-game, the player maintains a mixed, strategic pattern: still cooperating substantially when they expect high returns from others’ contributions, but seizing clear end-of-game opportunities to defect without fear of reprisal. This combination suggests they are forward-looking and horizon-aware, but not purely theoretically backward-inductive; they keep using conditional cooperation while it seems profitable, then switch to free-riding when the marginal strategic value of cooperation disappears."

Contributions span the entire action space, and they shift frequently rather than locking into a stable level. This indicates high volatility and experimentation, not a fixed rule like “always give X” or “always match the average.”\n\nTheir behavior tracks the group’s cooperation level: when others appear to contribute generously and consistently, the player often joins with medium to high contributions, sometimes fully contributing. When perceived cooperation drops or looks mixed, they readily switch back to very low or zero contributions. This pattern supports a conditional strategy grounded in “cooperate when it seems safe and profitable, defect when it does not.”\n\nThey clearly understand the payoff structure. At times they exploit high cooperation by contributing nothing or very little while receiving substantial returns, which is consistent with payoff-oriented free-riding. At other times, they invest heavily when others are also contributing a lot, suggesting awareness that high joint contributions increase their own earnings despite personal cost. This mix implies they are not ideologically cooperative; they weigh private versus group returns and alternate between exploiting and supporting the public good.\n\nThey do not show a rigid fairness or reciprocity norm. They are willing to defect even when others are broadly contributing high amounts, and they do not systematically “reward” high-contributing environments by reliably matching them. Instead, they sometimes respond to generous peers with free-riding, sometimes with strong cooperation. This variability suggests that fairness considerations, if present, are secondary to outcome maximization and adaptive testing.\n\nRisk tolerance appears moderate. They are willing to make large contributions under uncertainty about how long high cooperation will last, but they never commit to a sustained period of high giving. They appear comfortable accepting the risk of being exploited in some rounds if the environment looks highly cooperative, but they quickly protect themselves when cooperation appears more fragile or uneven. Overall, they seem to balance exploration of cooperative gains with protection against being the “sucker.”\n\nThey adapt rapidly. The alternation between full, partial, and zero contributions over the game indicates ongoing updating rather than a predetermined time path. They seem to use simple reinforcement-style learning: high payoffs in cooperative environments can elicit generous actions, but signs of lower cooperation or reduced returns trigger retreat into more self-regarding behavior. There is no evidence of strong moral or identity-based commitment to cooperation; their type is best described as flexible, opportunistic, and strategically responsive to group contributions.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThe player displays clear end-game awareness and uses it to tilt further toward self-interest, but without a smooth, monotonic decay in cooperation.\n\nThey know how many rounds are left and adjust behavior across the later horizon. In the early and middle segments, they repeatedly cycle between cooperative and non-cooperative actions, indicating ongoing experimentation and conditional cooperation. In the final segment of the game, they still sometimes contribute medium or even high amounts, which shows they are not simply following a strict backward-induction logic of “always defect near the end.” However, they also intersperse these cooperative moves with zero contributions, and the final decision in the last round is to free-ride completely.\n\nThis pattern suggests a pragmatic rather than principled approach to the end game: they do not commit to a clean “cooperation collapse,” but they lean increasingly on self-interested choices when future interactions are most limited. They do not appear to invest in building or maintaining a long-run cooperative reputation in the final rounds, consistent with the absence of future-oriented reciprocity concerns once the horizon approaches.\n\nTheir late-game strategy remains exploratory: even close to the end, they sometimes test whether cooperative environments can still yield high payoffs by contributing non-trivially, but when in doubt—or when marginal gains from cooperation look less secure—they default to keeping their full endowment. The last-round free-ride fits an expectation that there is no longer any strategic value in signaling cooperation or supporting the public good when no future payoff interactions remain.\n\nOverall, their end-game response is: aware of the horizon, willing to opportunistically cooperate if it still seems profitable, but fundamentally inclined to exit the game in a self-protective, non-cooperative mode once continuation value disappears."

They typically give a substantial portion of their endowment, with occasional moves higher when the group is strongly cooperative and rare moves to the maximum. They rarely exploit low group contributions by cutting back dramatically; instead, they maintain a cooperative baseline even when others free‑ride. This suggests a stable internal norm for “fair” giving that is not tightly tied to the minimum level needed for personal gain.\n\nTheir contributions show conditionality, but only in a soft, banded way. When others contribute heavily, they are willing to raise their own contribution into the high range, sometimes close to full cooperation, indicating that they value matching or supporting a cooperative norm. When cooperation in the group weakens, they typically do not retaliate by dropping to very low levels; rather, they revert to their personal default, which remains clearly above minimal or purely selfish giving. This pattern suggests a “pro‑social but not self‑sacrificing at all costs” type.\n\nThey appear to understand that in this game structure, any contribution above zero is individually costly relative to free‑riding but jointly beneficial, yet they behave as though sustaining group efficiency and fairness is worth some private cost. They are unlikely to be a pure payoff‑maximizing free‑rider. Instead, they seem to trade off material payoff against a desire for a reasonably cooperative, fair group outcome. Their behavior is compatible with a conditional cooperator who sets their own contribution band fairly high and uses it as a default, rather than micro‑adjusting each period to squeeze maximum advantage out of others’ generosity.\n\nRisk tolerance appears moderate. They are willing to keep contributing robust amounts even when cooperation wobbles, which implies tolerance for the risk of being exploited in the short term. However, they avoid persistently extreme full contributions; they rarely “go all in,” which suggests some concern about downside risk and a preference to hedge: they cooperate significantly but keep a buffer for themselves. Overall, they act like a norm‑driven, conditional cooperator with a stable internal reference point, moderate risk tolerance, and limited opportunism.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nAwareness of the game horizon does not lead this player to sharply reduce cooperation near the end. Their contributions remain within their usual moderate‑to‑high band in late rounds, including the final one, rather than collapsing toward minimal contributions. This indicates that they either do not reason in a strict backward‑induction, end‑game‑defection way, or they choose to override such reasoning in favor of maintaining their fairness or cooperation norm.\n\nThere is some mild responsiveness to the evolving cooperation level as the game progresses: when the group is strongly cooperative later in the game, they are comfortable maintaining or slightly increasing their own contributions; when cooperation is more mixed, they fall back to their personal default rather than exiting cooperation entirely. Importantly, there is no evidence of a strategic “cash‑out” phase, where they would sharply reduce giving just because the game is about to end.\n\nThis pattern suggests that the player treats the presence of many remaining or few remaining rounds similarly, prioritizing consistency with their internal cooperative standard over horizon‑dependent opportunism. They seem to value maintaining a stable cooperative identity or pattern even when there is no future to reward or punish behavior, implying that their cooperation is at least partly principle‑driven rather than purely based on future reciprocity."

These are clustered during periods when the group’s contribution level is clearly high and stable, and when their own previous payoffs from free‑riding are already strong. This pattern indicates conditional cooperation, but in an asymmetric form: they are willing to contribute only intermittently and typically after the group has already demonstrated substantial cooperation. They do not appear to initiate cooperation; rather, they join in selectively once it is “safe” and profitable.\n\nContribution magnitudes are volatile rather than stable. Choices range from no contribution to the full endowment, with intermediate values also appearing. There is no clear monotonic trend over time; instead, their behavior alternates between exploiting the group and sporadically supporting it. This volatility suggests they experiment with different contribution levels rather than following a fixed rule.\n\nTheir reactions imply they track whether the environment is cooperative and adjust accordingly. When peers’ contributions are very high and consistent, they sometimes respond with large contributions. When peers’ cooperation is mixed or declining, they revert quickly to zero or near‑zero contributions. This is consistent with a pattern of “cooperate when others are already highly cooperative and the marginal cost is outweighed by expected return, defect otherwise.”\n\nThere is no strong evidence of a fairness norm that requires proportional or reciprocal giving. Even when others contribute much more on average, they frequently continue to free‑ride. Their cooperative episodes do not clearly match others’ exact average; instead, they jump between extremes, suggesting that fairness or equality is not a dominant motive.\n\nRisk tolerance appears moderate. They do at times make large contributions that could be risky if others were to drop their contributions, but they do this mainly once there is repeated evidence that the group is already cooperative. They rarely risk high contributions in periods of weaker group cooperation. This indicates that they are sensitive to payoff risk and prefer to exploit predictable cooperative climates rather than gamble in uncertain ones.\n\nOverall, their contribution persona is: primarily self‑interested and exploitative, but with a pragmatic willingness to contribute substantially when the group already provides strong cooperative guarantees and when such cooperation appears individually profitable.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThe player shows awareness of the finite horizon but does not follow a simple “end‑game defection only” pattern. Instead, their late‑game behavior remains mixed: both high contributions and full free‑riding appear in the final portion of the game.\n\nThere is no clear monotonic decay of cooperation toward the end. They sometimes make very large contributions even in late rounds, and then revert to zero in adjacent rounds. This indicates that horizon awareness does not by itself dictate a uniform end‑game strategy; they remain responsive to perceived group behavior and immediate payoff considerations rather than switching permanently to pure defection.\n\nTheir late‑game pattern suggests they still condition on the cooperative environment even with few rounds remaining. When others appear highly cooperative, they sometimes continue or even escalate their own contributions, despite the short remaining horizon. When group cooperation is less secure or more uneven, they quickly switch back to free‑riding. This conditionality persists up to the final round.\n\nBecause their contribution levels fluctuate throughout and do not converge to a single strategy at the end, it is difficult to infer a sophisticated backward‑induction logic. Instead, they seem to use a relatively myopic, round‑by‑round assessment: continue exploiting a cooperative group most of the time, but occasionally contribute substantially when it seems both safe and profitable, regardless of proximity to the final round.\n\nIn new games with a known endpoint, this type is likely to retain the same pattern: they free‑ride frequently throughout, including in late rounds, but may still intersperse occasional high contributions near the end if the group remains strongly cooperative and the immediate expected returns from the public good stay high."

They do not anchor on an equal-share or proportional contribution principle; at times they contribute less than most others when the group is generous, and at other times they contribute more than some peers when the group is mixed. This points to a flexible, payoff-sensitive mindset rather than a strong fairness-driven identity.\n\nTheir willingness both to contribute the maximum and to contribute nothing, even when the social environment looks broadly similar, indicates relatively high risk tolerance and a readiness to test extreme strategies.

The player does not appear to treat the final round as a special opportunity for a last-moment exploit; they still contribute a nontrivial amount at the very end rather than dropping to zero. This suggests that their primary decision rule is not a backward-induction style “defect at the end and work backward,” but an ongoing evaluation of group context and payoffs that continues unchanged through the horizon.\n\nIn new environments, this implies that even in finite-horizon settings the player does not automatically defect in late rounds.

They frequently pick a mid-level amount instead of always giving nothing or everything, suggesting they balance self-interest with sustaining group returns. They occasionally fully free-ride, particularly when others are already contributing heavily and group cooperation appears robust, which indicates exploitation of favorable group behavior rather than principled unconditional cooperation.

Instead, they seem comfortable benefiting from others’ generosity at times and do not consistently match the highest contributors. Their willingness to vacillate between zero, intermediate, and full contributions suggests moderate risk tolerance: they are willing to deviate from whatever the majority seems to do, but not in a purely selfish or purely altruistic direction. They are not rigidly inequality-averse; they accept scenarios where they gain more than heavy contributors and do not subsequently compensate by over-contributing.\n\nOverall, their persona is that of a flexible, opportunistic conditional cooperator: they prefer cooperative, high-contribution environments and will support them with nontrivial or full contributions, but they also strategically exploit such environments by occasional free-riding or dialing down their own contribution when they judge group cooperation to be sufficiently high or fragile.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nAwareness of the finite horizon does not produce a pronounced end-game collapse in cooperation for this player. In the final segment of the game, they continue using the same basic repertoire—mostly intermediate contributions with occasional higher ones—rather than sharply dropping to persistent free-riding once the end is near. There is no clear shift to a purely self-regarding, zero-contribution strategy in the final rounds.\n\nTheir behavior instead suggests a stable heuristic: maintain moderate contributions in most periods and adjust upward or downward slightly in response to how cooperative the group seems, independent of proximity to the final round. Near the end, they still invest nontrivially in the public fund, implying that they either do not strategically backward-induct or do not prioritize extracting maximal end-game private payoff at the expense of cooperation.\n\nAny subtle changes are small relative to their established pattern. They do not escalate to reliably maximal contributions as a “last gift,” nor do they systematically unwind cooperation. This indicates that while they know how many rounds remain (as per game rules), that knowledge does not dominate their decision-making. They continue to treat late rounds similarly to mid-game, with the same opportunistic yet partially cooperative stance. Their end-game type is therefore “horizon-aware but not horizon-driven”: they may understand the game is ending, but they do not radically change strategy in response."

Across the game, they tend to contribute well above the group average, often close to the maximum, but they do not lock into blind full cooperation. Instead, they adjust around a high baseline in response to perceived changes in others’ behavior and the group’s contribution level.\n\nThey initially experiment with low and medium contributions before quickly moving into a pattern of strong cooperation. Once they see that many peers are regularly giving substantial amounts, they typically match or slightly exceed the prevailing cooperative norm. They are willing to give the full endowment in many rounds and frequently choose contributions in the upper range, indicating strong pro-social inclination combined with acceptance of the individual cost.\n\nTheir contributions are not perfectly stable: they occasionally drop to moderate or even zero contributions. These drops coincide with situations where the group’s contributions are more uneven or where some players free-ride more visibly. This suggests conditional cooperation: they are willing to sustain high giving while others also contribute reasonably, but they temporarily reduce their own contribution when they infer that the environment is drifting toward lower cooperation. However, these lower-contribution episodes are short-lived; they typically revert quickly to high contributions if group cooperation recovers, indicating they prioritize restoring a cooperative equilibrium over retaliatory defection.\n\nThey display sensitivity to fairness at the group level. When others are broadly contributing high amounts, they appear comfortable matching that level, and they do not systematically undercut the group. The few low-contribution choices seem more like tests or responses to perceived unfairness than a consistent desire to exploit others.\n\nTheir risk tolerance is moderate to high. Given that personal returns from contribution depend on others, they repeatedly accept short-term risk in order to support a high-contribution environment, even after episodes where such generosity yields relatively lower payoffs due to weaker group contributions. They do not show systematic payoff maximization via free-riding; instead, they trade off some individual security for the prospect of higher group payoffs, consistent with a cooperative but strategically aware profile.\n\nOverall, this player is best characterized as a conditional high cooperator: generally generous, responsive to the group’s cooperative climate, and willing to bear individual cost to support high-contribution equilibria, but not fully unconditional.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nAwareness of the finite horizon does not trigger a collapse of cooperation for this player. In the late game, including the final rounds, they continue to contribute at high or upper-mid levels rather than shifting into systematic free-riding. There is some fluctuation and a slight tendency to lower from full-max contributions to strong but not maximal amounts, but there is no clear end-game defection wave.\n\nThis pattern suggests that they either do not heavily apply backward-induction reasoning or they place substantial weight on cooperative norms and consistency over final-round exploitation. They appear more inclined to “finish cooperatively” than to exploit the final opportunity for personal gain.\n\nTheir late-game behavior remains conditional: when the group maintains robust contributions, they sustain high giving; when group contributions are more mixed, they adjust slightly downward but still stay cooperative. The final round continues this rule-based pattern rather than exhibiting a unique, one-off deviation.\n\nIn short, their end-game strategy is to keep cooperating at a high level with moderate fine-tuning rather than to abandon cooperation, indicating a stable pro-cooperative orientation that persists even when no future rounds remain."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThe player is a flexible, payoff-conscious conditional cooperator with intermittent free-riding. They do not commit to a single stable contribution level; instead, they alternate between zero, moderate, and high contributions. Their choices track the overall cooperativeness of the group: they are more willing to contribute when others appear highly cooperative and when the public fund remains strong, and they reduce or drop contributions when they see lower or unstable group contributions.\n\nThey clearly recognize the private incentive to free-ride: they repeatedly take the option to contribute nothing while benefiting from substantial group contributions. However, they are not a pure defector; they regularly choose non-minimal contributions, sometimes relatively high ones. This mix suggests they balance personal earnings with some willingness to support group efficiency, rather than following a strict selfish or altruistic rule.\n\nTheir contribution pattern is volatile rather than fixed. They move between low and high contributions multiple times, indicating ongoing adjustment rather than a simple early decision. This volatility appears responsive to perceived norms: in phases when many others seem generous, they frequently join in with sizeable contributions; when there is visible heterogeneity or some apparent free-riding by others, they sometimes switch back to low or zero contributions.\n\nThey display a weak but present fairness or reciprocity norm. They never systematically match the most cooperative players, but they do seem uncomfortable being purely exploitative for the entire game: after episodes of low giving, they later choose to contribute generously even when they could keep all coins and still benefit from others’ giving. This suggests a limited internal standard of “doing their share,” though that standard is inconsistent.\n\nRisk tolerance appears moderate. The player is willing to “invest” in the public fund in situations where they cannot predict exact future behavior of others but where recent evidence suggests a cooperative environment. At the same time, they often hedge by choosing mid-level contributions rather than always going to the maximum, signaling some caution about overexposure if others defect.\n\nOverall, the player is best described as a strategically adaptive, opportunistic cooperator: they exploit cooperative environments at times but also help sustain them once they trust that others are reliably contributing. Their cooperativeness is conditional, fluctuating with their assessment of the group’s behavior and their own payoff experience.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThe player is clearly aware of the finite horizon and does not follow a simple “cooperate to the end” rule. In the last several rounds, their contributions remain variable rather than monotonically declining or increasing. They sometimes contribute substantial amounts close to the end, but they also intersperse zero contributions, including in the final round.\n\nThere is no consistent pattern of escalating generosity or systematic end-game defection. Instead, their late-game behavior looks like a continuation of their earlier conditional style: they respond to the current cooperative climate more than to the abstract fact that the game is ending. When others remain relatively cooperative late in the game, the player is still willing to contribute non-trivially in some of those rounds, despite having no future rounds in which reputation or reciprocation can pay off. At the same time, they seize opportunities to free-ride near the end, including at the very last possible decision.\n\nThis combination suggests that horizon awareness is present but not dominant. The player does not appear to run a backward-induction strategy; instead, they treat late rounds largely like earlier ones, with slightly more readiness to defect opportunistically when the payoff from free-riding is salient. Their cooperation does not collapse entirely as the end approaches, but it becomes more selective and interspersed with full defection, consistent with an adaptive type that weighs immediate payoff opportunities more heavily than long-run relational concerns once the horizon is short."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a highly stable, near-unconditional high contributor. They overwhelmingly choose the maximum possible contribution and maintain this choice across almost the entire game, with a single, isolated deviation where they keep their full endowment for themselves and then immediately revert to full contributions thereafter. This pattern suggests that their default policy is “always contribute fully,” rather than finely tuning their behavior to momentary payoff changes.\n\nThey appear willing to contribute at high levels even when others’ average contributions are relatively low and volatile. They do not systematically match the group’s average, nor do they visibly punish low contributors by reducing their own contribution after seeing free-riding. Instead, they continue to put in the maximum, indicating low sensitivity to short-term exploitation risk and a high tolerance for contributing in mixed groups that include defectors.\n\nTheir contributions track more with a social or efficiency norm (“it is good to fully contribute”) than with strict reciprocity to individual others. They do not selectively respond to particular peers’ changes in contributions; when others fluctuate between low and high cooperation, this player’s contribution remains essentially constant. The brief instance of zero contribution does not trigger a lasting strategic shift, which suggests either an experiment with self-interest, a momentary test of what happens if they free-ride, or a short-lived reaction to previous low group contributions. Since they promptly return to maximal giving and then stay there, the most consistent interpretation is that they identify as a cooperator and regard the deviation as an exception rather than a new rule.\n\nThey show no sign of gradually decaying contributions as the game progresses. High contributions persist through early, middle, and late phases despite significant variation in the group’s behavior. This indicates strong internal cooperation norms and low volatility: they neither escalate nor withdraw in a tit-for-tat manner, and they do not chase the profit-maximizing individual strategy of persistent low contribution despite having enough opportunities to reconsider.\n\nTheir fairness norms appear to favor collective efficiency over strict payoff equality. They continue to invest heavily even in the presence of repeat low contributors, which implies they accept some inequity in individual payoffs if the group output stays reasonably high. Risk tolerance is high in social terms: they accept being exploited by free riders rather than adopting defensive defection. From the perspective of classic PGG typologies, they most closely resemble a “strong altruistic cooperator” or “norm-driven unconditional cooperator” with only very limited and quickly reversed experimentation with defection.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nAwareness of the game horizon does not meaningfully erode this player’s cooperation. Across the late portion of the game, including the final rounds, they continue to contribute the maximum amount. There is no visible “end-game unraveling” where they reduce contributions as the remaining number of rounds shrinks. Instead, their cooperative stance is maintained right through the final decision.\n\nThey do not attempt to exploit the group in the final round by dropping their contribution, even though doing so would be individually profitable and cannot be punished or rewarded in future interactions. This suggests that their strategy is not based on backward induction about future payoffs, but on a more time-invariant rule or internal standard (“I contribute fully in this kind of game”). Their behavior is consistent with a player who either does not prioritize horizon-based optimization or who values maintaining a cooperative identity or principle more than capturing the one-shot gain from late defection.\n\nThe absence of contribution decay near the end of the game also indicates that they either do not expect others to massively defect in the final rounds, or, if they do, they still choose to cooperate despite that expectation. In either case, the looming end does not shift them into a more self-interested mode. They remain a stable, high contributor from start to finish, with no systematic end-game adjustment beyond ordinary payoff fluctuations caused by others’ changing behavior."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a strongly prosocial, high-contribution type who treats “always give the socially efficient amount” as the default strategy. They contribute the maximum almost every round, including early on when cooperation norms are only emerging and later when others begin to free-ride or experiment with low contributions. Their contributions are highly stable, not volatile: they do not react myopically to short-term drops in their own payoff or to others’ opportunism.\n\nThey appear to anchor on a simple rule: maximize the group pot because the marginal per-coin return clearly exceeds 1. They persist with this rule even when the group temporarily unravels and when multiple others are openly free-riding, which indicates they prioritize long-run expected gains for the group (and themselves) over punishing defectors by reducing their own contribution. Only once do they deviate from maximum, contributing a mid-level amount while the group temporarily collapses; they immediately return to maximum afterwards. This isolated deviation suggests either a brief test of what happens when they reduce, or a moment of doubt or distraction, not a systematic strategic shift.\n\nThey exhibit relatively low sensitivity to unfairness compared to typical conditional cooperators: free-riding around them does not trigger sustained retaliation or decay in their giving. They seem willing to “carry” defectors if that keeps the public good large. Risk tolerance is high: they continue to stake their full endowment into the pot even when group behavior is noisy and future rounds/length are uncertain. They behave as a near “unconditional cooperator with rare experimentation,” driven more by a norm or heuristic than by fine-grained payoff tracking.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThe player’s tone is group-oriented and casual, with flashes of sarcasm or mild aggression but mostly aligned with cooperative messaging. Early on they actively support the emerging norm of maximum contributions, verbally endorsing full cooperation alongside others. This indicates willingness to coordinate and reinforce group norms, not just silently free-ride on others’ persuasion efforts.\n\nThey engage in light teasing and one pointed insult toward an identified low contributor, showing some emotional investment in group fairness and a readiness to socially sanction defectors verbally, even though material punishment is unavailable. Later, when some players consider sabotaging the group outcome, they explicitly declare that they will stick to contributing fully, framing their behavior as principled and somewhat playful. They also make at least one informational claim about the likely length of the game, suggesting they follow instructions but may misremember or extrapolate, and they are comfortable sharing beliefs to shape others’ expectations.\n\nThey are responsive enough to the ongoing conversation to answer questions about rounds and to joke with others, but they do not dominate the chat. Their style is engaged but not hyper-talkative: they back cooperation norms, throw in a few comments when norms or expectations are in question, and otherwise let others do most of the coordination talk. Overall they adopt a “supportive cooperator with occasional sharp edges” communication style: encouraging the cooperative equilibrium while expressing some disdain for chronic defectors.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThe player observes that some others systematically earn more by contributing less, yet they do not shift into sustained low contributions in response. Their behavioral reaction to unequal outcomes is minimal in terms of changing their own giving: they largely ignore the individual payoff advantages of defectors and continue to pursue the socially efficient contribution level. This suggests they place more weight on maintaining a high group return than on closing payoff gaps, and they are not strongly driven by inequity aversion in a retaliatory sense.\n\nVerbally, they do register disapproval when a particular free-rider benefits from others’ cooperation, including a direct insult. This shows that they notice and emotionally react to outcome asymmetries, but they compartmentalize that reaction in chat rather than in their economic choices. When the group’s total contributions temporarily collapse and everyone’s payoffs fall, they experiment once with a lower contribution, then immediately return to max contributions once cooperation recovers. This pattern indicates they are aware that lower group contributions hurt everyone, and they interpret recovery in others’ behavior as a reason to restore their own full cooperation rather than to continue punishing past defectors.\n\nThey appear to believe that sustained group cooperation is achievable and self-reinforcing, and they act as if their own steady, high contributions help maintain that state even when others wobble. In short, they emotionally dislike free-riding but do not let that dislike override their main objective of keeping the public good large and the game profitable for the group."

This indicates weak negative reciprocity and strong commitment to the cooperative norm.\n- Fairness norms that are outcome-focused: they emphasize that everyone is better off when all maximize, rather than focusing on equal shares per se. They appear willing to personally sacrifice to preserve an efficient, high-output state for the group.\n- High risk tolerance in payoff terms: they repeatedly expose themselves to exploitation by free-riders and do not hedge by lowering their own contributions when exploitation appears.

They also explicitly flag critical moments when cooperation is at risk, signalling awareness of fragile trust.\n- Persuasion style: rather than moralizing about “good” and “bad” people, they argue in terms of consequences and obvious logic (“otherwise we will all get less; it’s obvious how it works”). They appeal to common interest and to the transparency of the payoff structure, not to guilt or obligation.\n- Responsiveness to group dynamics: they respond when the group shows signs of unraveling (mentions of doing 0, speculation about stopping contributions) and when someone is clearly free-riding. They step in at those moments to reassert the cooperative norm.\n- Mild escalation toward defectors: while mostly constructive, they are willing to use light negative language toward persistent free-riders, likening them to someone taking credit in a group project. This is more shaming than abusive, indicating disapproval but not full-blown hostility.\n- Engagement style: they are active but not dominant; they don’t spam the chat, and they don’t participate in off-topic jokes beyond what’s needed to maintain rapport. Their interventions are brief and goal-directed: to stabilize cooperation and keep contributions high.\n- Cognitive framing: they show an explicit understanding of the game’s structure (public good multiplier, shared returns) and communicate as if they expect others to be rational and to see the same logic once it is explained.\n\nIn sum, they are a norm entrepreneur for full cooperation: engaged, rational-argument focused, occasionally sharp with defectors, but primarily oriented toward group-level coordination rather than personal venting or socializing.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey clearly monitor others’ contributions and implied payoffs and use that information to shape their messages, though not their own contribution level.\n\nTheir reactions show:\n- Sensitivity to exploitation: they notice when certain players repeatedly contribute very little and implicitly identify them as free-riders. They publicly call out such behavior, framing those players as benefiting unfairly from the group’s effort.\n- Limited behavioral retaliation: despite frustration and social criticism of defectors, they do not materially reduce their own contributions in a sustained way to punish them. Their main “sanction” is verbal disapproval and norm-enforcement, not payoff-based retaliation.\n- Group-focused framing of outcomes: they repeatedly describe the consequence of reduced contributions as a collective loss (“we will all have less”, “we all get much less”), rather than emphasizing their own relative disadvantage. This suggests a payoff concern at the group level more than concern about personal ranking.\n- Hopeful belief in collective learning: they act as if clear explanations and social pressure can bring defectors back in line, even after several exploitative episodes. The continued use of cooperative appeals late in the game indicates they expect at least partial responsiveness to norms, not inevitable collapse.\n- Distinction between “mistakes” and “types”: when others suggest misclicks or experiment briefly with lower contributions, they do not fixate on them; but persistently low contributors are likened to low-effort group members taking undeserved credit. This points to an underlying model of stable “free-rider types” versus cooperative types.\n- Emotional tone: their responses show irritation but controlled; they do not resort to profanity or personal insults, even when others do. Their frustration manifests in mild sarcasm and analogy rather than aggression.\n\nOverall, they respond to others’ outcomes primarily through social norm enforcement and renewed appeals for cooperation, not through adaptive defection. They continue to act as a consistent cooperator while trying to socially discipline or persuade free-riders, indicating a “high-cooperation, low-punishment” type who values maintaining a cooperative climate over personally equalizing payoffs."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a strongly pro-social, near-unconditional high contributor who anchors the group on full cooperation. They almost always give the maximum possible amount, with one notable deviation to a mid-level contribution when the group briefly unravels, after which they immediately revert to max-giving and stay there. Their default heuristic is that contributing fully is obviously optimal because the marginal return on a contributed coin is low if kept privately and high when pooled; they explicitly articulate that there is “no reason not” to give everything. They are not purely altruistic in the sense of sacrificing for fairness: they understand and accept that minimal contributors and free riders earn more in some rounds, but they still keep contributing fully because the absolute payoffs are high and stable when the group cooperates. This shows relatively high risk tolerance with respect to exploitation and a preference for maximizing group surplus and the “easy money” flow over tracking their relative advantage. Their contributions are only weakly conditional on others’ behavior: they complain, scold, and momentarily lower their own contribution at one point, yet they do not adopt a sustained retaliatory or tit-for-tat pattern. They tolerate persistent low contributors, including a repeatedly undergiving peer, without systematically lowering their own giving in response. They hold and promote an efficiency norm: the correct “game-theoretic” move, in their mind, is to keep everyone at the maximum to maximize the per-round surplus, even when some individuals behave “tightly.” Self-interest matters, but in the sense of maximizing expected earnings through stable cooperation rather than through exploiting others.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThe player is outspoken, initiative-taking, and uses chat as a primary tool to coordinate high cooperation and to enforce social norms. They greet the group, propose the cooperative strategy early, and continue to reinforce the “always max” norm throughout. Their tone is mostly casual and pragmatic, with some light humor, but periodically escalates into explicit profanity and direct insults toward perceived free riders or “tight” contributors. They use shaming language and moralizing (“acting like a dick,” “cant even think,” “fuck you,” “what a dick”) when frustrated by low contributions or perceived hypocrisy, signaling low tolerance for opportunism once norms are established. At the same time, they engage in side conversation about surveys, earnings, and working from home, indicating comfort with informal social interaction and not being solely focused on the game. They use simple economic reasoning about payoff structure in their persuasion: they stress that the per-coin return is poor privately, that the small private endowment is trivial, and that maximizing contributions generates a large, reliable bonus. They reference “game theory” to frame the behavior normatively, suggesting they see themselves as rational and analytically minded, and they expect others to think in such terms as well. They respond to others’ questions and comments, reinforcing coordination statements from cooperative peers and answering about payment structure and bonuses. Overall, they are engaged, reactive, and often take a leadership/cheerleading role in pushing for maximum cooperation, but they express irritation openly when others deviate.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThe player tracks others’ contribution behavior and group-level outcomes quite closely and interprets them through a fairness and efficiency lens. They notice when particular individuals contribute less than the group and repeatedly refer to these as “tight” or “fuckers,” indicating a negative moral and emotional reaction to unequal burdens, even though they do not directly adjust their own contributions in a systematic punitive pattern. They understand that low contributors can earn more individually while others keep maxing and call this out explicitly, showing that they are not naïve about free riding. Yet their primary concern appears to be the erosion of trust and the risk that others will stop contributing, which would collapse the high-bonus regime; they warn that if “trust is lost,” payoffs will drop towards the trivial baseline. They thus interpret outcome trends (declining average returns when contributions fall) as evidence of harmful greed and use those observations to scold deviants and to re-motivate cooperators. They do not have access to direct punishment or reward tools in this game, so their main “sanction” response is verbal: shaming, labeling, and trying to reframe defection as short-sighted or stupid. They are aware that non-contributors or minimal contributors sometimes end up with higher round payoffs and they sarcastically frame such players as thinking they are “clever,” but rather than imitating them, they double down on the call for everyone to keep giving. Their adaptation is thus primarily in rhetoric, not in their own contribution strategy: they continue to give highly even in the presence of exploitation, with only a brief, isolated drop, and focus on steering the social narrative back toward “easy money for all” through mutual cooperation."

Their contributions are highly stable across the game: they continue to give the maximum even when others start lowering their contributions, and even when the group briefly coordinates around cynical or retaliatory strategies. There is a single clear deviation where they sharply reduce their contribution while many others also experiment with lower amounts; this looks more like a one-off test or momentary alignment with the group mood than a shift in their basic strategy, because they immediately revert to maximal giving and then maintain it.\n\nTheir behavior is conditional only in a very weak sense: they do not appear to condition their contributions strongly on observed defection by others. Instead, they act as if contributing the maximum is “the right play” almost regardless of others’ behavior. They repeatedly frame the small private endowment as nearly worthless compared to the redistributed payoff, indicating an internal fairness/efficiency heuristic: maximizing the public good is seen as obviously rational for everyone, and keeping coins is treated as both irrational and self-defeating in the long run.\n\nThey seem relatively risk-tolerant in a social sense: they continue to cooperate even as some players lower contributions, accepting the risk of being exploited in order to preserve a high-payoff norm. They do not hedge by giving intermediate amounts; their pattern is essentially “all-in cooperation” with one brief low-contribution outlier. They also appear focused on expected monetary value rather than narrow fairness of shares: they tolerate that low contributors sometimes earn more in a given round if they believe that maintaining high contributions keeps absolute payoffs large for themselves as well.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nTheir tone is concise, pragmatic, and generally cooperative, with occasional light informality. They participate in early social bonding but quickly shift toward commenting on payoffs, effective hourly earnings, and the benefit of sustained cooperation. They explicitly encourage others to maintain high contributions, using simple cost–benefit arguments: the per-round bonus is framed as “easy money,” the private endowment as trivial. They repeatedly remind the group that reducing contributions will sharply reduce everyone’s income, and they emphasize that the value of the shared pot far exceeds the small, forgone 20-coin endowment.\n\nThey attempt mild persuasion rather than confrontation. When criticized by others (who misattribute low contributions to “green bird”), they do not retaliate or argue about blame; instead, they restate the efficiency logic and urge continued max contributions. Their arguments focus on long-run group outcomes rather than moral condemnation. They also give meta-comments about the game’s duration and earnings, which signals attention to the experimental context and incentive structure.\n\nThey engage playfully at times (joining in on joking or off-topic chat), which suggests they are socially comfortable and not purely instrumental. However, their core use of communication is to reinforce a cooperative norm and reorient others away from short-term free-riding. They explicitly advise ignoring those proposing zero-contribution strategies, signaling an intent to stabilize expectations around full cooperation.\n\nResponsiveness is moderate: they react to the group’s strategic discussions (about donating zero, about round length, about survey payment structure) and tailor their comments to these concerns. They do not individually call out specific low contributors by name, which fits a preference for system-level persuasion rather than interpersonal conflict.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey clearly track group outcomes: they reference pay per round in real-money terms and explicitly note how lower contributions reduce everyone’s payoff. They interpret others’ defections primarily through an efficiency lens: low contributors are not just opportunistic; their behavior is described as self-harming in the long run because it undermines the high-earning equilibrium. Their repeated insistence that the private coins are nearly worthless relative to the redistributed pot shows that they benchmark behavior against aggregate earnings, not just relative standing.\n\nThey do not express direct anger or resentment toward low contributors, even when others in chat become insulting or adversarial. Instead, they use these moments as opportunities to restate that under-contributing “hurts them in the end” and that the rational response is to keep maxing out. This indicates a low inclination toward punitive or spiteful responses and a higher inclination toward didactic, efficiency-based reassurance.\n\nThey appear relatively insensitive to being personally misattributed as a low contributor (the “green bird” comments): there is no observable attempt to defend their reputation or correct the record. From their behavior, their primary response to others’ outcomes is to preserve the cooperative norm that sustains high payoffs, rather than to seek fairness in the distribution of gains or to protect their own image. They do not suggest reciprocal punishment strategies (e.g., “if others give 0, we should all give 0 back”); instead, they warn that such retaliation only collapses the pot and leaves everyone with minimal returns.\n\nOverall, they respond to others’ outcomes as a payoff-maximizing cooperators’ advocate: they see the public good level and per-round earnings as the key signals, and use communication and their own consistent contributions to nudge the group back toward the high-contribution equilibrium whenever it starts to wobble."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a stable, unconditional high contributor. They always give the maximum possible amount in every round, without deviation, even when many others free‑ride or experiment with low or zero contributions and even when this clearly reduces their own relative payoff. Their strategy follows the public-goods efficiency logic: they repeatedly emphasize that contributing fully benefits everyone and that withholding contributions will eventually collapse the gains. They do not condition their contribution on others’ behavior in the short term; instead, they pursue a long‑horizon, group‑optimal strategy regardless of temporary defections. This indicates a strong internal norm for full cooperation, low inclination to retaliate, and a willingness to accept exploitation risk in order to preserve the social optimum. They appear to understand the payoff structure and use it to justify continuous max contributions rather than to search for individually profitable deviations.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThe player communicates frequently, with a calm, positive, and explanatory tone. They repeatedly encourage others to contribute fully, framing cooperation as “easy money” and stressing that the endowment is small compared to the bonus generated by full participation. They consistently try to maintain group morale, using inclusive language (“we,” “my friends,” “the rest of us”) and supportive slogans. Their persuasion style is rational and forward‑looking: they appeal to long‑run consequences (loss of trust, collapse to minimal payoffs) rather than shaming specific individuals. They engage directly with emerging norms and debates (e.g., whether to drop to zero or to act out of spite) and attempt to steer the group back to full cooperation, sometimes explicitly asking others to “ignore the noise.” They respond to others but rarely change topic toward themselves, and they avoid insults or hostility even when others do. Overall, they are a cooperative coordinator who combines informal leadership with a non‑confrontational, prosocial style.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThe player is highly attuned to the relationship between others’ contributions and everyone’s payoffs, and they repeatedly comment on how lower contributions from some reduce the payoff level for all. They interpret free‑riding and low giving as short‑sighted “greed” that will ultimately hurt the defectors themselves by undermining trust and driving the game toward minimal returns. However, their reaction stays constructive: they do not propose punishment or retaliation and explicitly warn that responding with zero or very low contributions would only make everyone worse off. When others gain more by contributing less, the player highlights the systemic risk rather than dwelling on their own disadvantage. They appear to see the group’s total earnings and continuity of cooperation as more important than relative fairness in any single round. They also show no sign of updating toward defection even after multiple instances of others getting higher payoffs by contributing less, suggesting a strong, stable preference for sustaining high cooperation over adjusting to exploit or mirror others’ behavior."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a highly stable high contributor who almost always gives the full endowment. Their default is to contribute the maximum available amount, and they maintain this pattern from the beginning through the end of the game. There is a single clear deviation to a lower (but still positive) contribution; it coincides with an explicit statement about intending to contribute nothing in a subsequent round and with a moment of visible group frustration and experimentation. Despite that declaration, they immediately revert back to full contributions in all following rounds, including when others around them reduce their own giving.\n\nTheir strategy appears primarily efficiency‑oriented rather than narrowly self‑interested: they consistently choose the option that, under this multiplier, maximizes joint returns. They do not seem to condition their contributions on the exact degree of cooperation of others; even when several group members start free‑riding or partially defecting, this player keeps giving the maximum instead of punishing by cutting their own contribution. This suggests weak conditional cooperation and a tendency toward “unconditional cooperator” behavior in practice.\n\nThey show some willingness to experiment strategically at one point when trust momentarily declines, but the experiment is minimal, very short‑lived, and they promptly return to the cooperative norm. They tolerate the risk of being exploited by low contributors in order to preserve high group earnings, indicating low aversion to being the “sucker” and relatively high risk tolerance in service of collective gains. Fairness concerns, if present, are subordinated to maintaining the high‑contribution equilibrium.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nTheir tone is light, somewhat ironic, and socially engaged rather than moralizing or confrontational. They join the initial social greetings, participate in off‑topic banter about bank switches and the meta‑nature of the experiment, and occasionally joke about another player likely being a bot. They do not attempt to lead or organize the group around contribution norms: they never lecture about the payoff structure, never scold low contributors, and do not push explicit coordination instructions.\n\nThey respond to others’ topics rather than initiating new strategic discussions themselves. When the chat drifts into non‑game topics (banks, surveys, PhDs), they chime in with brief, humorous, or acknowledging comments. When they talk about contribution strategy, they do so in a casually provocative way (e.g., announcing an intention to contribute nothing next round during a tense moment), which reads more like playing with the social dynamics than mounting a serious revolt. Their subsequent behavior contradicts that declaration, implying it is not a firm commitment but more of a performative or joking threat.\n\nThey are attentive to the game’s structure and practicalities: they ask about the number of rounds, publicly report their current cumulative payoff when others discuss totals, and acknowledge the conversion rule for the bonus. They answer direct informational prompts (e.g., confirming the bonus rate) but do not try to persuade others through detailed argument. Overall, they engage socially, maintain a playful tone, and avoid direct conflict or moral condemnation.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThis player observes others’ outcomes and contribution patterns but does not visibly retaliate or reward through their own contributions. When some group members free‑ride or give less, they continue to fully contribute, even though this reduces their relative advantage and makes them vulnerable to exploitation. They do not publicly complain about making less than low contributors, nor do they express resentment when those players earn higher round payoffs as a result of under‑contributing.\n\nTheir one noticeable behavioral deviation to a lower contribution aligns with a moment of collective frustration and talk of withholding contributions, but there is no sustained pattern of conditional response to specific individuals’ outcomes. After that brief dip, they remain cooperative even as fluctuations in others’ contributions continue. This suggests they place substantial weight on maintaining a cooperative environment and high total pot, and relatively little on punishing defectors via their own actions.\n\nIn chat, they occasionally frame others’ behavior jokingly (such as calling a persistently under‑contributing player a bot) but not in a way that escalates conflict or tries to enforce norms. They neither join the more aggressive name‑calling nor defend the low contributor. Their main visible response to seeing group earnings rise and fall is to keep doing what they know yields high payoffs collectively and to share their own cumulative payoff when asked. Overall, they behave as a robust cooperator who monitors outcomes but does not let inequities or short‑term exploitation strongly alter their own cooperative strategy."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a strongly pro‑cooperative, near-constant high contributor who treats “maxing” as the default strategy. They contribute the full endowment in essentially every round, with one clear deviation when they sharply reduce their contribution once, then immediately revert to full contributions afterward. That deviation appears as an experimental or emotional blip rather than a new long‑run strategy, given its singular nature and the immediate return to full giving.\n\nTheir baseline norm is: everyone should contribute the maximum, and they personally abide by it even when others free‑ride. They do not condition their contributions tightly on others’ recent behavior; they keep contributing fully through periods with noticeable under‑contributors and only once momentarily drop below full contribution despite repeated opportunities to defect profitably. This points to a “conditional in principle, but stubbornly cooperative in practice” type: they understand the exploitation risk but still prioritize maintaining the cooperative equilibrium.\n\nThey appear payoff‑aware and accept that high contribution is individually profitable in this parameter setting, yet their persistence when others under‑contribute indicates they are willing to sacrifice short‑term advantage to sustain group cooperation. Risk tolerance seems moderate: they tolerate the risk of being exploited by a few low contributors as long as the majority keeps cooperating, and they do not pre‑emptively defect when some defection shows up.\n\nThey show a nascent willingness to rethink the “always max” rule late in the game, discouraging maximal contributions once after repeated exploitation and mixed behavior from others. However, they do not act on this in their own choices beyond the single low‑contribution round, suggesting that their internal threshold for abandoning cooperation is high. Fairness norms are clearly strong: they want everyone to contribute equally and visibly dislike inequitable sharing, but they respond mainly through talk and social pressure rather than by systematically cutting their own contribution.\n\nOverall type: “Stubborn high cooperator with a brief, non‑sustained flirtation with defection.”\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThe player is verbally sparse but strategically active when they do speak. Their tone is concise, cooperative, and mildly corrective rather than angry. Early on, they explicitly align themselves with the group’s “max contribution” norm, endorsing the consensus when others promote it. As the game progresses, they occasionally step in to steer group norms: they oppose a suggestion that everyone contribute nothing, instead urging others to keep contributing maximally, and later they briefly reverse that stance, advising against continued maxing when exploitation and inconsistency have become salient.\n\nThey rarely initiate new topics; instead they respond to existing coordination discourse. Their messages focus almost entirely on contribution norms rather than off‑topic chatting or personal small talk. This indicates a task‑oriented, efficiency‑focused communication style: they speak when they think it affects group strategy, not to socialize.\n\nThey sometimes echo or reinforce pro‑cooperation messages from other high contributors, positioning themselves as part of the “responsible cooperators” subgroup that tries to keep the group on track. When they briefly advise against maxing, they do not justify it explicitly in words, but the timing coincides with increased free‑riding; their communications then reflect a more cautious or disillusioned stance, suggesting they are responsive to perceived norm erosion.\n\nThey do not join in personal attacks on low contributors and do not use insults; their one direct challenge (“or not”) to a proposal to all defect is minimal and dry rather than emotional. Altogether, they are a low‑volume, norm‑focused communicator who engages selectively for coordination and mild persuasion, avoids hostility, and adjusts their verbal advice as their assessment of the situation changes.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThis player clearly attends to others’ contributions and resulting outcomes and uses them to update their beliefs and recommendations, though they do not make large or sustained changes to their own contribution pattern. They see that some players consistently under‑contribute and still receive the same redistributed payoff, and they recognize the classical free‑rider problem: their comments and endorsements of “max” norms are attempts to protect the high‑payoff cooperative equilibrium despite visible exploitation.\n\nWhen chat participants complain about the “green bird” or other low contributors effectively earning more per coin by giving less, the focal player does not echo the hostility but does take it into account strategically: they oppose nihilistic suggestions to make everyone drop to zero, arguing implicitly that maintaining high contributions is still better, then later express the opposite norm (“no don’t put max”) once continued exploitation and inconsistency have accumulated. This sequence suggests they update their stance in light of the group’s observed behavior and aggregate payoffs, but do so cautiously and without consistent follow‑through in their own choices.\n\nThey show no evidence of envy over individuals temporarily earning more by contributing little; instead, their concern is about the stability of group cooperation and the overall payoff level. They do not celebrate or punish specific individuals, nor do they single out particular players by name. Their reactions are at the level of group norms rather than interpersonal scorekeeping.\n\nIn sum, they watch others’ contribution/payoff patterns, understand the incentive structure, and adjust their verbal recommendations to the group when they think the cooperative arrangement is at risk, but personally remain mostly locked into a high‑contribution pattern even in the face of exploitation."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a highly cooperative, near-unconditional high contributor. Their baseline is to give the full endowment to the public fund and they maintain this for the vast majority of the game. Occasional downward deviations are rare, moderate, and short-lived rather than part of a trend.\n\nThey show awareness of incentives: the public multiplier makes group cooperation very profitable, and their behavior aligns with prioritizing maximizing total group returns over individual free-riding. They repeatedly continue to contribute fully even when others’ average contributions fall and when free-riding would be individually advantageous in the short run, indicating strong pro-social preferences and/or a rule-based “always cooperate” strategy rather than narrow payoff maximization.\n\nTheir contribution pattern is very stable overall. Brief reductions in contribution occur only a few times and never reach full defection; they seem more like small, exploratory or “hedging” adjustments than a shift to a selfish strategy. After such deviations, they quickly return to full contributions, suggesting a robust cooperative identity and low volatility.\n\nThey appear to be only weakly conditional on others’ behavior. They certainly observe fluctuations in group cooperation, including periods of lower average contributions, but they do not systematically match those lows or retaliate by cutting back. When the group is highly cooperative, they remain so; when the group is more mixed, they mostly still contribute fully. This implies they act more like a strong cooperator or “moral contributor” than a typical conditional cooperator who proportionally matches the group.\n\nFairness norms seem present but not dominant. They tolerate substantial heterogeneity in peers’ contributions, including clear free-riding, without sharply reducing their own giving. The absence of strong downward adjustment suggests they accept some unfairness in order to sustain a high-contribution environment, or they prioritize efficiency over strict reciprocity. At the same time, the rare partial reductions could reflect mild sensitivity to perceived inequity or a test of whether full cooperation from others is stable.\n\nRisk tolerance appears relatively high in a social sense. They are repeatedly willing to “risk” being exploited by low contributors, banking on the benefits of maintaining a cooperative norm. Their occasional partial withholdings show they are not blind to risk, but their dominant pattern is to accept downside variance in personal payoff in order to keep contributing at a high level.\n\nOverall, this player is best described as a stable, principled high contributor with limited conditionality and a strong inclination toward cooperative efficiency rather than self-protection.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThis player shows little to no classic end-game decay in cooperation. Despite full knowledge of the finite horizon, they maintain high contributions through to the final round, including the very last decision. There is no shift into exploitative free-riding at the end, nor a systematic tapering as the remaining rounds dwindle.\n\nAny mid-to-late-game deviations from full contribution are small and do not form a downward trajectory toward the end; instead, high giving persists or even reasserts itself. This indicates that their cooperative rule or preference does not weaken as the horizon shortens. They do not appear to follow backward-induction reasoning that would justify last-round defection, at least in terms of actual behavior.\n\nTheir end-game behavior suggests either that they value consistency with a cooperative self-image, have internalized a norm of contributing regardless of stage, or continue to prioritize group efficiency right up to the final decision. Strategic exploitation of others’ continued cooperation at the end of the game is absent in their pattern."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is predominantly a high, near-max contributor who quickly settles into a norm of contributing the full endowment and maintains it almost every round. They begin with a moderate contribution and then shift to full contributions once a “max” norm is discussed, suggesting they are conditionally cooperative but willing to lead with high contributions once they believe the group will follow. Their contributions are very stable: they give the maximum in all but one round, where they explicitly announce and execute a deviation to zero as a retaliatory or experimental response to another player’s persistent free-riding.\n\nTheir behavior shows a clear understanding of the payoff structure: they explicitly assert that contributing more yields a larger overall return and that holding back “doesn’t make sense” or leaves people worse off, and they reinforce the idea that one should end each decision with nothing kept. They exhibit relatively low risk aversion regarding others’ cooperation: they continue to fully contribute even while a known defector persists in low or zero contributions for many rounds. Only after extended frustration do they briefly abandon the cooperative norm, then immediately return to full contributions.\n\nThey strongly endorse a fairness norm that everyone should contribute the maximum each time; they judge deviators harshly, label them as greedy or bad at math, and at one point encourage a coordinated zero-contribution response as a form of social sanction. Their one-zero deviation appears strategic and expressive (to punish or test the suspected exploiter and/or see if others will follow) rather than a shift in long-term strategy. Overall, their type is a “principled cooperator with retaliatory impulse”: they default to collective efficiency and high giving, but are willing to momentarily defect to punish perceived exploitation or to demonstrate a point.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThe player is highly engaged in chat, reactive to others, and comfortable using humor and mild insults. Their tone mixes sarcasm and irritation with informational content. They align themselves with the cooperative majority and repeatedly reinforce the norm of maximal contributions, sometimes in very succinct, directive messages. They participate in coordination efforts by declaring their own intended contribution, echoing group norms, and endorsing simple rules of thumb (“max,” “0 once,” “you should be holding 0 when you’re done”).\n\nThey are particularly focused on the under-contributing “chicken” player. Early on, they join others in calling out that player’s low contributions, directly stating that the numbers observed contradict the claimed behavior, and they explicitly attribute the pattern to poor understanding, trolling, or being a plant/bot. Over time, their language toward this player becomes more openly negative (calling them greedy, bad at math, a troll) and they even ask the “researchers” to remove that player. They do, however, also provide concrete instructions on how to interact with the interface, indicating that they are not purely hostile; they are willing to help but quickly lose patience when the pattern persists.\n\nThey show responsiveness to group queries and information: they correct mistaken beliefs about the number of rounds, reference the stated time range for the session, and repeat or clarify the payoff logic for others. Their persuasion style is blunt rather than diplomatic: they use socially charged labels (e.g., greedy, trolling) as part of normative enforcement, and they explicitly lobby for a coordinated zero-contribution move as a collective punishment tactic when they feel exploited. They remain actively conversational until the end, continuing to comment on others’ behavior and to restate negative judgments about the persistent low contributor.\n\nPersonality-wise, they present as confident, norm-enforcing, and somewhat confrontational. They are socially engaged, prefer explicit coordination, and care about both efficiency and fairness, but they are quick to express contempt for those they perceive as knowingly exploiting the group. They do not withdraw from interaction; instead, they lean into engagement, using communication as a tool to enforce norms, signal their own strategy, and shape group behavior."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a strict, unwavering full cooperator. They always contribute the maximum available amount, never deviating, regardless of others’ behavior, conflict in the group, or stage of the game. Their contributions are not conditional on others’ fairness or civility; they continue to contribute fully even when some others free ride or when inter-player hostility escalates. This suggests they internalize a simple rule such as “full contribution is obviously optimal for everyone” and act on it consistently. They appear risk-tolerant regarding being exploited: they do not hedge or reduce contributions in response to low-contributing or norm-violating others. Their fairness norm is strongly efficiency-focused: they support the high-contribution, high-payoff equilibrium and do not experiment with self-serving deviations.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThe player does not speak at all in the chat. They neither initiate coordination nor respond to others’ messages, including direct calls for group action or end-game plans. This indicates a strongly silent/observing communication style: they pay attention (as shown by prompt, norm-consistent behavior) but remain entirely nonverbal. They neither join in bullying nor defend targets, so their stance on the interpersonal conflict is unknown. They do not publicly endorse norms, explain their reasoning, or attempt to persuade free riders; instead, they enforce preferred outcomes solely through contribution and punishment choices. They show no signs of seeking social approval, status, or alignment with any faction in the chat. Responsiveness is behavioral rather than verbal: they adjust punishment patterns over time but never through explicit communication.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThere is no visible end-game unraveling in their contributions: they continue to contribute the maximum in all late rounds, including the final one, with no sign of decay. They do not switch to free riding when the horizon nears, despite others openly discussing end-game punishment strategies. Their punishment spending remains active and sometimes substantial right up to the late game, indicating they are willing to sacrifice payoff even near the end, where deterrence cannot benefit them in future rounds. This suggests they do not heavily weight standard backward-induction logic; instead, they likely prioritize maintaining norms or expressing disapproval over finely optimizing terminal payoffs. They show no explicit acknowledgement of the approaching end and do not join last-round coordination proposals in chat, so their conscious horizon awareness is unknown, but behaviorally they remain stable and principled rather than opportunistic.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThe player is a moderately to highly active punisher and is willing to pay nontrivial costs to sanction others. Their punishment is selective rather than random: they spend when others clearly deviate from the maximum-contribution norm or behave in ways that undermine group efficiency or cohesion (e.g., early free riding, later inconsistent contribution, or possibly those seen as “problem” players). They sometimes refrain from punishing when the group is fully aligned and contributing maximally, but when a salient target emerges, their punishment intensity can escalate, even at significant personal cost. The pattern is more consistent with second-order norm enforcement and deterrence than with direct retaliation, because they are not themselves targeted and do not appear to be punishing in response to personal loss alone. They also continue punishing in late rounds when future benefits are minimal, which suggests a possible expressive or principled motive: they are willing to incur net losses to uphold their view of correct behavior. However, since their punishments cannot be directly tied to specific chat statements (they never speak), the exact identity of their targets and fine-grained motives beyond “noncompliance with the cooperative equilibrium” remain uncertain (low confidence on specific target mapping; higher confidence on general willingness to enforce norms at a cost)."

They always give the entire endowment and never deviate, even when a few others free‑ride at the start and at the end. Their behavior suggests they treat full contribution as the obvious, default “correct” action rather than a contingent response. Early comments show they hold a fairness and efficiency norm that everyone should contribute; they frame non‑contributors as “selfish.” Once the group reaches universal cooperation, they maintain full contributions without hesitation, apparently prioritizing group payoff and norm consistency over individual short‑term gain. They do not appear to condition contributions on others’ recent behavior in any fine‑grained way; instead they exhibit a rule‑based strategy: everyone ought to contribute fully, including themselves, regardless of small deviations. Risk tolerance around being exploited is relatively high—they keep cooperating even when a free‑rider briefly appears again near the end. Their choices are highly predictable and non‑volatile.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nTheir tone is norm‑setting and mildly moralizing but not hostile. Early on, they actively try to coordinate the group around full contributions, explicitly stating that contributing is best for everyone and discouraging selfishness. Once cooperation is established, they mostly step back, offering occasional positive reinforcement to the group and encouraging them to “keep it going.” They do not join off‑topic banter and ignore side conversations about geography, earnings platforms, or jokes; their communication is task‑focused and sparse. They respond to the group’s success with brief praise, aligning themselves with cooperative group identity. They show no signs of aggression, sarcasm, or trolling, and they do not escalate when others defect; instead they rely on gentle social pressure and a single explicit threat of sanction to support the cooperation norm. Responsiveness to others is selective: they engage when it concerns contribution behavior and norms, but otherwise remain quiet.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey never actually use the punishment mechanism, despite having multiple opportunities and at least two clear instances of others contributing nothing. However, they explicitly state a conditional intention to punish a specific low contributor if that behavior continues, targeting a repeat defector rather than punishing immediately. This suggests they are willing in principle to use punishment as a deterrent against persistent free‑riding, but prefer to give others a chance to comply after social pressure. They appear selective: sanctions are reserved for clear, repeated norm violations, not one‑off mistakes. They do not express any desire for revenge, only for enforcing contribution norms. Once the target complies, they drop the idea and never revisit punishment, even when another player defects later; that last defection occurs against a backdrop of strong overall cooperation and end‑game uncertainty, and they still abstain from punishing. Overall, they are a reluctant, conditional punisher who prioritizes communication and group coordination over costly sanctions.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nThey are never punished in this game, so their direct reactions to being sanctioned are unknown. They never observe a need to retaliate or to respond publicly to punishment, because no one targets them. Based on their general style, if punished in a future setting, they are more likely to interpret it as norm enforcement than as a personal attack, and could update or at least acknowledge it, but this is speculative and low confidence. Their behavior provides no evidence of retaliatory tendencies or of forgiving explicit punishers, so their exact response pattern to identifiable punishers remains unknown."

They appear comfortable with the personal risk of being exploited by low contributors and prioritize maximizing group returns over their own narrow payoff. They implicitly accept the group norm that contributing is “what you do here,” and they never test whether deviating would be punished or tolerated. Fairness concerns are present but mild: they nudge a past low contributor once, but otherwise continue to cooperate without visible resentment or demands for reciprocity.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nTheir communication style is light, sociable, and low-pressure. They rarely initiate coordination, but when they do, it is brief and informal, encouraging someone who previously defected to join the contributing norm rather than threatening or shaming them. Once cooperation is established, they shift to casual, humorous chat about money and identity, signaling comfort and group belonging rather than task-focused leadership. They occasionally make short, upbeat comments that reinforce the sense that the group is doing well and that the game is easy and lucrative, which indirectly supports continued cooperation without overt persuasion. They do not engage in arguments or moralizing; they neither scold defectors nor join in more aggressive calls for punishment. Overall, they engage but stay in the social “background”: responsive enough to show presence and solidarity, but not trying to steer group norms beyond gentle prompts.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey never use the punishment mechanism. This holds even when a clear target for norm enforcement is available and others are openly considering punishing that target. They do not advocate for punishment in chat and do not echo others’ punitive sentiments. Their stance suggests a preference for positive coordination and patience over costly sanctions, despite the punishment technology being relatively efficient. The lack of any trial use indicates either a principled reluctance to harm others, skepticism about the value of punishment when cooperation can be sustained socially, or a desire to preserve earnings by avoiding any costly actions that do not directly increase the public good. They act as a pure cooperator without enforcement: willing to contribute fully but unwilling to spend to discipline others, even for deterrence.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nPunishment is never directed at them in this game, so their direct response to identifiable punishers is unknown. They never become a punisher themselves, so there is no evidence of retaliatory dynamics with others. Given their steady full contributions, lack of conflictual chat, and avoidance of sanctioning, it is plausible—but not confirmed—that they would respond to any future punishment with continued cooperation rather than escalation. However, their actual reactions to being punished (forgiveness, compliance, or retaliation) remain unknown due to lack of observation."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a stable, unconditional full cooperator within the binary-choice structure of this game. They always choose the cooperative option and never deviate, even when a few others free-ride. Their behavior suggests they internalize a strong norm that “everyone should contribute” and they follow it irrespective of minor defection. They do not appear to condition their own contribution on the last round’s pattern or on the presence/absence of punishment. They show no signs of strategic withholding or experimentation; once they see that widespread cooperation is possible, they simply maintain it. They also show an instrumental, money-focused motivation: they talk explicitly about earnings and wanting to “speedrun” to maximize pay, which in this environment strongly aligns with maintaining high group cooperation. Risk tolerance with respect to others’ deviations is moderate: they remain cooperative despite occasional zero contributions and do not test defection as a response. Fairness concerns are present in their early endorsement of “everyone contribute,” but they do not escalate when deviations occur, indicating they prioritize group payoff and smooth play over reacting to small inequities.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nTheir tone is light, humorous, and friendly. Early on, they support pro-cooperation norms in a casual way rather than lecturing others, using short, informal messages and playful symbols. Over time, they shift into more social and off-topic chat (weather, location, Prolific usage, income), engaging in small talk and joking with others. They actively participate rather than lurking: they respond to others’ comments, riff on ongoing jokes, and occasionally initiate new topics (e.g., about maximizing speed or earnings). When discussing enforcement mechanisms, they briefly express a pragmatic evaluation that the punishment tool is a “lose-lose,” signaling an efficiency-focused mindset. They coordinate around speed and effort—encouraging fast clicking to increase total earnings—but do not directly attempt to organize punishment campaigns. Their style is inclusive and relaxed: they show no hostility, even toward low contributors, and display comfort with mild teasing and banter. Overall, they are socially engaged, cooperative in tone, and oriented toward group cohesion and shared gains rather than conflict.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey never use the punishment option despite having multiple opportunities and at least some small instances of under-contribution in the group. Their one explicit statement about punishment frames it as inefficient for both parties, indicating an efficiency and payoff-maximization perspective rather than a retributive one. They are aware of the possibility of targeting free riders (others mention punishing defectors, and they see it), yet they do not join in or suggest using deductions. This suggests a “non-punishing cooperator” type: they rely on social norms and voluntary compliance instead of costly sanctions. Their threshold for punishing appears very high or effectively unreachable within this game; minor defection is tolerated, and they do not display anger or calls for retaliation. The underlying motive seems to be: maintaining high group payoff and time efficiency is more important than norm enforcement via costly punishment. Whether they would ever punish under extreme or repeated exploitation remains unknown, but in a largely cooperative environment they abstain entirely.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nThey are never punished in this transcript, so their direct behavioral response to being sanctioned is unknown. They also never act as a punisher, so reactions to identifiable punishers (e.g., gratitude for norm enforcement or resentment for aggression) are not observed. Given their expressed view that punishment is jointly harmful, it is plausible—but not evidenced—that they would see punishment as wasteful rather than as justified deterrence, yet this remains low confidence. They do not publicly encourage or praise others for punishing, nor do they criticize those who consider it; they simply route around the mechanism by ignoring it. In a new environment with identifiable punishers, it is unclear whether they would comply more, retaliate, or attempt to negotiate; available data only support that, when unpunished, they maintain full cooperation and a friendly, non-confrontational stance."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a stable, unconditional full cooperator in this environment. They always contribute their entire endowment when given a binary choice between nothing and everything, and this does not change over time or in response to others’ small deviations. Their behavior aligns with a strong efficiency norm: they act as if maximizing the group return is the default, even when a few others occasionally contribute nothing. They show no evidence of conditional cooperation (they do not reduce their own contribution when others free‑ride) and no sign of experimentation with defection. Their risk tolerance appears relatively high: they accept being vulnerable to free‑riders and to the possibility that cooperation could break down, rather than hedging by defecting. They appear to value maintaining a cooperative norm and the associated social harmony over exploiting short‑term individual gains, even when the marginal per‑capita return on their own contribution is less than 1 (indicating their preferences are not purely selfish). Fairness norms are present but moderate: they criticize clear deviation once in chat, but do not adjust their contribution level or use punishment to enforce strict equality.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nTheir communication is minimal but aligned with pro‑social group norms. They participate in chat only a few times, and always to support cooperation or to express mild disapproval of defection. They echo group sentiment that everyone should contribute and briefly affirm another’s message supporting cooperation, indicating they are attentive to the chat and comfortable reinforcing existing norms rather than leading or initiating them. When another player free‑rides after a run of cooperation, they gently call this out as unacceptable, but without aggression or threats. They do not engage in off‑topic banter or side conversations and avoid extended socializing; their style is concise, cooperative, and norm‑affirming rather than playful or domineering. They do not attempt to coordinate punishment strategies or to negotiate specific future behaviors; instead, they rely on shared understanding and group momentum. Overall, they engage selectively and instrumentally, to signal approval of cooperation and disapproval of defecting, but not to manage the group in detail.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey never use the punishment mechanism, despite clear opportunities and social license to do so. They experience others’ non‑contribution as “not cool,” but still decline to impose costly deductions. This suggests a reluctance to incur personal cost to sanction others, even when defection is salient and even when group members explicitly discuss targetable free‑riders. Their stance is consistent with either a strong aversion to interpersonal conflict, a belief that punishment is an inefficient “lose‑lose” tool, or a preference for maintaining goodwill over enforcing strict reciprocity; the exact underlying motive is unknown. They also do not engage in strategic or retaliatory punishment; their non‑use of punishment is consistent across early and late phases, regardless of whether contributions are perfectly cooperative or slightly eroded. They exhibit no evidence of “moralistic” second‑order punishment and do not try to deter future misbehavior via threats. In sum, they are a non‑punishing cooperator: they contribute fully but leave enforcement to others or to social messaging rather than to costly sanctions.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nThey are never targeted with punishment, so their direct behavioral response to being punished is unknown. They also do not publicly react to others’ punishment decisions (if any occur, they are not visible in the transcript), and they do not comment on punishers or on the legitimacy of using deductions. Because they never punish, there is no evidence of retaliatory punishment by others against them, and thus no observable retaliation cycle. From their consistent contributions and calm, norm‑supportive chat, their likely response style when punished would be acceptance or quiet compliance rather than confrontation, but this is speculative and not observed. Their willingness to maintain full cooperation even when others defect suggests they are resilient to mild norm violations and unlikely to escalate conflicts, but their actual behavior toward identifiable punishers in future settings remains uncertain."

They always contribute their entire endowment and never deviate, even when a few others occasionally fail to contribute. Their cooperation is stable and not contingent on short-term fluctuations in others’ behavior. They openly endorse the norm that everyone “chips in” and frames full contribution as the default, sensible behavior. They accept that others might sometimes get more than them and explicitly state that this is acceptable as long as everyone pays their way, which indicates low envy and a strong efficiency orientation. They appear comfortable with the group relying on mutual cooperation and do not hedge against potential free-riding, suggesting relatively high trust and low risk aversion regarding others’ cooperation in this context. There is no evidence of strategic reduction of contributions in response to observed defections, so conditional cooperation cannot be inferred; instead, they act as a principled, norm-driven cooperator.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nTheir tone is warm, affiliative, and lightly humorous. Early on, they help articulate the cooperative norm in simple, inclusive terms, trying to keep the group aligned without being confrontational. They are willing to explain the role of punishment in enforcing contributions but do so matter‑of‑factly, not aggressively. They frequently provide positive reinforcement when the group cooperates and use encouragement rather than pressure. They participate in small talk (about weather, locations, side income, platform practices) and share personal information at a low level (country, length of time on the platform, approximate earnings), which signals willingness to build rapport and a sense of “we’re in this together.” They respond to others’ topics instead of driving the conversation entirely, showing engagement and responsiveness. When chat drifts into joking or mild chaos, they comment on it with light humor rather than trying to reassert control, reflecting a relaxed, socially attuned style. Overall, they communicate as a pro-social, group‑oriented participant aiming to maintain a cooperative, pleasant atmosphere, not just maximize payoff in silence.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey never spend any coins on punishment. Even when some group members contribute nothing or visibly mis-coordinate early on, they do not actually sanction anyone. Nonetheless, they explicitly acknowledge the function of punishment as a tool to penalize non-contributors, so their non-use is not due to misunderstanding. This combination suggests a preference for norm explanation and social pressure over costly enforcement. There is no evidence of retaliatory motives or desire to “teach someone a lesson” through deductions. Their stance appears to be that cooperation should be achieved through shared understanding and encouragement, and that as long as contributions largely remain high, the punitive mechanism can be ignored. Their threshold for punishing is therefore either high (only after more serious or persistent free-riding) or, possibly, they are principled non-punishers; the data do not distinguish these, so their exact trigger is unknown.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nThey are never punished by others in this game, so their direct response to being sanctioned is unknown. Because they never punish, there is also no direct evidence of how they react to identifiable punishers (e.g., with gratitude, resentment, or indifference). Indirectly, their consistently cooperative play, lack of hostile language, and acceptance that others might sometimes earn more suggests they are unlikely to respond to punishment with retaliation or withdrawal of cooperation, but this inference is low confidence since it is not tested in the transcript."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a highly cooperative, near “pure cooperator” type with one brief deviation. They strongly favor full contribution whenever partners also cooperate and display a stable pattern of investing the entire endowment into the public fund. The lone free-riding move early in the game appears exploratory or opportunistic rather than the start of a defection pattern: once they see that others reliably contribute, they revert to full cooperation and maintain it without further experimentation. Their behavior is consistent with a payoff-sensitive yet norm-following strategy: they are willing to exploit cooperators once to test or capture a windfall, but not at the expense of collapsing group cooperation. They accept the moderate personal cost of contributing under this MPCR and appear comfortable forgoing short-term unilateral gain in exchange for stable, predictable mutual benefit.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nTheir communication is minimal, polite, and non-directive. They respond to another player’s greeting but do not initiate further discussion, proposals, or coordination. This suggests a low-communication, low-intrusiveness style: they neither try to lead nor to negotiate explicit contribution norms. They appear content to rely on observed behavior rather than verbal agreements. There is no evidence of attempts to persuade, pressure, or criticize others, and no visible reaction in chat to the one instance of another’s defection, indicating a restrained, non-confrontational social stance. Overall, they engage enough to acknowledge others but prefer silent coordination via actions rather than conversation.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThere is no visible end-game defection: they maintain full contributions through the final rounds, including the last one, despite clear knowledge of the finite horizon. This indicates either a stable cooperative preference or a belief that maintaining cooperation to the end is preferable to last-moment exploitation. They do not appear to adjust strategy as the remaining rounds shrink; their contribution pattern becomes more rigidly cooperative rather than decaying. This lack of end-game unraveling suggests they do not heavily engage in backward-induction reasoning or, if they do, they override it in favor of a consistent cooperative rule.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey never use the punishment option, even when they are directly exploited or when another group member defects. This indicates a strong reluctance to spend personal resources to harm others, despite the relatively efficient punishment technology. There is no evidence that they use punishment instrumentally to enforce norms, nor do they retaliate when they are the victim of free-riding. Their type is best characterized as “non-punitive cooperator”: they rely on positive behavior and reciprocity rather than deterrence. Whether this reflects moral aversion to punishment, disbelief in its effectiveness, or simple payoff-maximizing avoidance of costly actions is unknown, but their pattern is consistently non-punishing.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey observe others’ contributions and resultant payoffs but do not alter their long-run behavior in a retaliatory or opportunistic way. When they benefit by free-riding, they subsequently return to the cooperative norm once others resume cooperating; when another player free-rides later and gains a higher payoff than them, they neither punish nor reduce their own contribution. This suggests tolerance for occasional deviations and a willingness to “absorb” unfair outcomes without escalating. Their focus appears to be on maintaining a cooperative equilibrium rather than equalizing payoffs in every round. They seem to interpret others’ cooperative behavior as a signal to keep contributing fully and treat isolated defections as noise rather than grounds for breakdown of cooperation."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a strict, unconditionally cooperative contributor. They always give their entire endowment to the public fund, with no deviation across the game. Their strategy is stable and insensitive to others’ occasional free-riding: even when another player takes the entire endowment for themselves, they maintain full contribution rather than reducing or retaliating. This pattern suggests a strong internal norm or rule of “always cooperate” that overrides short-term payoff maximization. They do not appear to condition their behavior on fairness or on reciprocity; instead, they treat full contribution as the baseline regardless of group behavior. Risk tolerance regarding exploitation seems high: they accept that others might gain more than them and do not adjust. Whether this reflects intrinsic pro-social preference, confusion about incentives, or a deliberate commitment to efficiency is unknown, but their consistency indicates a deliberate or at least firmly held pattern rather than random play.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nTheir communication is minimal and purely phatic. They greet the others at the beginning, mirroring the emerging social convention, and then remain silent throughout. They make no attempts to propose strategies, request equal contributions, or comment on deviations. They also do not react verbally when others free-ride or when cooperation resumes. This suggests a low-engagement or reserved communication style: they are willing to be politely affiliative but do not use chat as a tool for coordination or social enforcement. There is no evidence of persuasion, negotiation, or emotional expression; their cooperative stance is enacted through behavior rather than talk. Responsiveness beyond the initial greeting is unknown or absent.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThey show no discernible end-game effect. Their contribution pattern remains identical through early, middle, and final rounds, including the very last decision when there is no future opportunity for reciprocity or reputation-building within this group. Awareness of the finite horizon is structurally available, but there is no behavioral sign that they incorporate it into their strategy. They do not attempt a last-round defection, nor do they taper contributions as the game progresses. This is consistent with a rule-based cooperative type who does not shift toward self-interest as the end approaches. Whether they conceptually recognize end-game incentives and ignore them, or simply do not reason in those terms, is unknown.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey never engage in punishment, even when doing so could reduce the payoff advantage of a clear free-rider. They refrain from using the punishment technology at all, across both cooperative and exploitative contexts. This indicates either a principled aversion to costly sanctioning or a purely payoff-focused assessment that punishment is not worth its cost, but the lack of any “test” use makes it more consistent with a non-punitive, tolerant type rather than an enforcer. They do not appear motivated by retaliation, inequality aversion in the punitive sense, or by deterrence aims; they simply absorb exploitation without sanctioning. Their strategy is thus cooperative but non-enforcing: they contribute fully yet do not invest in maintaining norms through punishment.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey consistently observe outcomes where others sometimes benefit disproportionately (e.g., when someone free-rides and earns more than them) and sometimes match them in earnings when everyone cooperates. Despite this, they do not alter their contributions or begin punishing. This indicates a relatively high tolerance of outcome inequality and exploitation at the behavioral level: unequal or unfair payoffs do not trigger strategic adjustment. When others return to full cooperation after a defection, they do not visibly “reward” it beyond continuing their pre-existing pattern of full contribution. There is no sign of reactive behavior to others’ use of punishment or reward, but that is likely because no one in the group uses these tools. Their focus appears to be on sustaining their own cooperative rule rather than responding to others’ payoff trajectories."

They consistently give the full endowment to the public fund in nearly every round, including the very first and the very last. The only exception is a single mid-game deviation where they contribute half their endowment while the group is broadly cooperative; this looks more like an experiment or temporary adjustment than a strategy shift, as they immediately return to full contributions and then maintain them through to the end. Their behavior indicates a stable fairness norm that favors high cooperation regardless of whether others free-ride. They tolerate persistent low contributions by at least one player without using their own contribution level as a retaliatory tool. They seem risk-tolerant regarding exploitation and prioritize maintaining a high-contribution environment over guarding against being taken advantage of. There is no clear evidence that their contributions are conditionally responsive to others’ individual choices; instead, they act as a consistent “moral anchor” for cooperation.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nUnknown. There is no chat content in the transcript, so their tone, persuasion attempts, and responsiveness in communication cannot be inferred. Their behavioral pattern (steadfast high contributions plus intermittent punishment) is consistent with someone who might advocate for fairness and cooperation, but this is speculative and unsupported by direct evidence.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThey show clear horizon awareness (the number of rounds is visible), but they do not reduce cooperation as the game approaches the final rounds. In the closing phase, they maintain maximal contributions and keep using punishment selectively, including in the very last rounds. There is no decay in their cooperative behavior or obvious “last-round defection.” Their pattern suggests they treat the end-game similarly to earlier stages, remaining focused on norm enforcement and group welfare even when there is no future opportunity for others to reciprocate. Any subtle adjustments in punishment size near the end appear small and do not amount to a qualitative shift in strategy.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey are clearly willing to incur substantial personal costs to punish. They do not punish in every round, but when they do, they often spend a non-trivial portion of their payoff. Their punishment is selective and appears targeted at players whose behavior deviates from a cooperative norm: primarily very low contributors or those who repeatedly contribute far less than the group of high contributors. They sometimes punish even when group contributions are already high, consistent with enforcing a principle (“everyone should at least match the group norm”) rather than purely responding to immediate payoff losses. Their punishment is not obviously tit-for-tat or retaliatory against those who punish them personally; instead, it seems oriented toward norm enforcement and deterrence, even at a net cost to themselves. They do not escalate indiscriminately when they receive deductions; after absorbing punishment from unknown others, they continue to cooperate and sometimes still punish apparent free-riders rather than attempting broad revenge.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey appear attentive to how others’ contribution and punishment choices translate into payoffs. When they punish, they often choose amounts that significantly reduce a target’s payoff, indicating sensitivity to the relative advantage that low contributors or non-punishers might gain. They do not mimic others’ strategies in a straightforward way: even when others gain by contributing little or by spending heavily on punishment, this player does not follow those patterns. Instead, they maintain their own cooperative standard and use punishment to narrow payoff gaps created by perceived free-riding. They do not reward high contributors, even implicitly, beyond maintaining high contributions themselves. There is no clear evidence of resentment-based targeting of players who end up with particularly high payoffs if those players are also cooperative; their concern seems more about contribution fairness than about absolute earnings. Overall, they respond to outcome patterns by reinforcing cooperation through stable giving and by strategically penalizing behavior that undermines that outcome structure."

They always contribute their entire endowment, from the very beginning to the very end, without any visible sensitivity to others’ average contributions, payoff differences, or punishment patterns. Their behavior fits a strong efficiency norm: they consistently choose the socially optimal action for the group, even when others free-ride or when they themselves are targeted with deductions. There is no evidence of conditional cooperation, reciprocity, or strategic adjustment; they do not reduce contributions in response to being punished or to persistent zero contributions by others. This suggests either a rigid adherence to a “do the right thing” or “maximize the public good” rule, or a strong preference for simplicity and consistency over strategic tailoring. Tolerance for exploitation appears high: they keep cooperating despite being singled out with negative payoffs multiple times. Risk tolerance regarding others’ opportunism is therefore high; they act as though their own cooperative standard is independent of others’ behavior. Whether this is driven by altruism, a moral rule, or misunderstanding of strategic incentives is unknown.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nChat is enabled in the game, but there is no chat content in the transcript, so their communication style, tone, and responsiveness in messages are unknown. There is no observable attempt at verbal coordination, persuasion, or norm-setting. Based on actions alone, they behave as a quiet, non-confrontational type: they never use punishment to send signals, and they maintain cooperation regardless of others’ actions, which is consistent with an action-based “leading by example” rather than verbal enforcement style. However, without chat logs, their actual engagement or avoidance in communication is unknown, and any inference about their rhetorical style or responsiveness to others’ messages is low confidence.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nAwareness of the time horizon is likely, since the interface displays remaining rounds, but their behavior shows no end-game effect. Contributions remain maximally cooperative through all rounds, with no decay, no attempt to exploit in late rounds, and no visible “last-minute” strategy shift. They do not appear to adopt backward induction or short-term payoff maximization at the end; instead, their decision rule is time-invariant. The absence of any contribution drop or punitive spike near the end suggests either that they prioritize consistency or norms over horizon-based reasoning, or that they do not strongly internalize the strategic meaning of the final rounds. Their long-run pattern is the same as their end-game pattern: stable full cooperation without punitive engagement.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey never use the punishment mechanism at any point. This holds despite repeated opportunities to sanction clear free-riders and despite instances where they themselves are punished. This pattern indicates a strong aversion to spending resources on punishment, even when punishment might plausibly deter low contributors or retaliate against those who target them. The absence of any punishment, even low-cost or symbolic, suggests either: (a) a principled non-punisher stance (e.g., disliking harming others or seeing punishment as wasteful), (b) a narrow focus on maximizing their own unspent coins, or (c) inattention or uncertainty about the punishment stage. Because they continue to cooperate fully in the face of others’ punishment behavior, deterrence is not part of their toolbox, and they do not engage in retaliation. They behave as a “pure cooperator, non-enforcer”: they contribute but do not police group norms through sanctions.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey see everyone’s contributions, payoffs, and punishment patterns, but they do not visibly react to these outcomes in their own decisions. They maintain full contributions even when some players repeatedly contribute nothing and others receive large payoffs while free-riding. They also maintain their behavior when punishment among others becomes intense and sometimes seemingly antisocial, and when they themselves become a target of deductions. There is no sign they try to “reward” good contributors via reduced punishment (they never punish anyone) or to “discipline” low contributors via sanctions. Likewise, they do not appear to adjust in response to fairness violations: being punished without cause does not trigger contribution reduction or aggressive punishment. This insensitivity to observed outcomes suggests that their decision rule is largely independent of the payoff landscape and of perceived fairness. It is consistent with a type who either (a) places intrinsic value on contributing regardless of external responses, or (b) follows a fixed heuristic that does not incorporate feedback. Their beliefs about why others punish or under-contribute are unknown; their actions do not reveal attempts to interpret or counteract others’ outcome patterns."

They behave as if full cooperation is the default and morally or strategically “right” choice, rather than something to be varied in response to others’ behavior.\n\nTheir contributions do not appear contingent on short-term payoff maximization: they continue to cooperate fully even when the group under-contributes and their own per-round payoff is relatively low. This suggests a strong internal norm in favor of contributing, with low sensitivity to exploitation risk. They tolerate free-riding by others without retaliating through reduced contributions.\n\nThey seem comfortable shouldering more than their “fair share” when others contribute less, yet they also remain engaged and mildly critical when some players do not match the cooperative norm. Overall, they embody a prosocial, high-trust type who treats contribution as a near-absolute rule, not a negotiable strategy.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nTheir communication is sparse but socially attuned. They respond politely to greetings and acknowledge successful coordination with a brief, positive signal. Their tone is friendly and light; they use a small expressive cue (a simple emotive symbol) once cooperation stabilizes, which reads as contentment or relief at the emerging norm.\n\nThey do not initiate detailed strategic proposals, but they do make at least one pointed, critical remark aimed at those not fully cooperating, implying awareness of and mild frustration with perceived hypocrisy or free-riding. This criticism is framed in a casual, somewhat joking style rather than overt aggression, suggesting they prefer soft social pressure over confrontational shaming.\n\nThey are reactive rather than leading in the chat: they respond after others talk about strategies and contributions, and they do not attempt to micro-coordinate specific contribution levels or reward patterns. Their engagement style is low-frequency but responsive, with a mix of politeness and light norm enforcement through comments rather than detailed argument.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey are willing but selective in using the reward mechanism. They rarely spend on rewards overall, and when they do, they spend modest amounts rather than systematically reinforcing all cooperators. Their use of rewards coincides with periods where others are contributing relatively more, suggesting that their reward behavior is conditional on observed cooperation level.\n\nThey do not use rewards to compensate themselves (since rewarding others is payoff-neutral by design, and they still choose to do it at times), implying that when they pay to reward, they are expressing approval or trying to support cooperative behavior rather than pursuing direct material gain. They show no clear pattern of rewarding in proportion to others’ exact contributions, and they do not reward every time cooperation improves, so their reinforcement is intermittent and somewhat cautious.\n\nThey refrain from rewarding during some full-cooperation episodes, which may reflect uncertainty about the impact of rewards, a desire to conserve payoff, or a belief that verbal and collective norms are sufficient once cooperation is established. They never use rewards punitively or manipulatively (the mechanism is symmetric cost/benefit), and their pattern suggests a primarily prosocial, norm-affirming intent: they are willing to incur small costs to encourage or acknowledge cooperative behavior but do not treat rewarding as a central or heavily strategic tool."

Their behavior fits a norm-following, efficiency-focused cooperator who prioritizes maintaining high group payoffs over individual short-term gain. There is no observable conditionality on others’ contributions; they continue to fully contribute despite one instance of zero contribution by another player and without any visible concern about being exploited. They appear risk-tolerant regarding potential free-riding and place strong weight on the cooperative norm once it is established. They treat full contribution as the obvious or “correct” choice and do not renegotiate that standard, suggesting a stable fairness or efficiency norm: everyone should give the maximum so everyone earns more.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nTheir communication is brief, cooperative, and supportive. They engage enough to affirm group norms and coordinate but do not attempt to dominate discussion. Early on, they express positive surprise at the high returns from cooperation and explicitly agree with the “always give maximum” norm. They acknowledge others’ plans for mutual benefit and respond succinctly, indicating alignment and consent rather than initiating new strategies. When asked about game structure (like the number of rounds), they provide straightforward information rather than speculation or pressure. Later, they encourage the group with a general compliment on performance and reason about reward schemes by noting that everyone must participate for side-contracts to work. Their tone is consistently friendly, polite, and constructive; there is no aggression, blame, or sarcasm toward anyone, including the one-time defector. They show awareness of payoff logic and use chat to clarify that coordinated rewarding is only beneficial if universal, but they stop short of actively organizing or enforcing that scheme. Overall, they communicate as a cooperative team member who values clarity and mutual benefit rather than as a strong leader or enforcer.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey never use punishment at any point, even when there is a clear opportunity: another player fully free-rides once while everyone else, including them, continues to contribute fully. They do not respond to this with sanctions, complaints, or even subtle social pressure. There is no evidence of retaliatory motives or willingness to use costly punishment for deterrence. This suggests either an aversion to punishment on principle, a belief that the cooperative norm is sufficiently stable without sanctions, or a preference to avoid conflict and negativity. Given their consistent full contributions despite no punishing and despite occasional asymmetries in reward receipt, they appear willing to absorb mild exploitation rather than introduce punitive dynamics. They behave as a non-punitive cooperator who relies on positive norms, rewards, and group goodwill instead of harm-based enforcement. Any inclination to punish is unknown but appears at most very low in practice.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey are an active but selective user of rewards, with a clear preference for reinforcing cooperation and reciprocating kindness. They reward only others, never themselves (self-reward is not possible), and they never pair rewards with punishment. Early in the interaction, they explicitly commit to rewarding after another player notes having given rewards without receiving any, and they follow through by distributing rewards broadly across cooperative group members. Over time, they alternate between periods of extensive, almost egalitarian rewarding of many or all contributors and periods of no rewarding, even while everyone continues to cooperate. They frequently include players who have been communicative or who express concern about being left out of rewards, and they occasionally target subsets rather than the entire group, suggesting a mix of reciprocity, gratitude, and perhaps an attempt at payoff balancing for specific individuals. They show some understanding of the underlying payoff logic, recognizing in chat that mutual rewarding can increase earnings if everyone participates, and they restate that this only works under full mutual compliance. However, they do not consistently enforce or follow that mutual-reward scheme once it becomes clear that not everyone always rewards; instead, their rewarding becomes more sporadic and selectively generous rather than strictly payoff-maximizing. Overall, they function as a prosocial rewarder: willing to spend their own payoff to thank, include, or support others, more motivated by reinforcing cooperation and fairness perceptions than by precise strategic optimization."

They do not appear to condition their actions on others’ exact contribution levels; even when one group member briefly contributes less, they continue to fully cooperate without punishment, reduction, or visible protest. This indicates high tolerance for minor norm deviations and a preference for norm stability over reactive adjustment. The player appears comfortable bearing the risk that others may not fully match their cooperation; they prioritize the collective outcome and adherence to a simple “always contribute everything” rule rather than calibrating contributions to protect themselves.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThe player does not send any chat messages, despite others using chat to encourage cooperation. This reflects a silent, non-leadership communication style: they neither initiate coordination nor verbally reinforce emerging norms. Instead, they “speak” through their consistent contributions. Their lack of verbal engagement suggests either low desire to manage others’ behavior directly, low need for social signaling via talk, or simple preference/comfort with passive participation.

Overall, they are a quiet cooperator who supports group goals through action rather than words.\n\n<REWARD>\nThe player never uses the reward mechanism, even when others are clearly cooperating at high and stable levels and when rewarders are identifiable to recipients. This indicates a strong reluctance to spend personal resources on direct positive incentives or gratitude payments, even in a fully cooperative environment. Their strategy appears to be: contribute maximally, but do not pay extra to influence or thank others. This could reflect several possibilities (all with low confidence): they may view contribution itself as sufficient cooperation; they may not see additional benefit from rewarding in an already cooperative group; they may be conserving payoff; or they may be indifferent or uncomfortable with active, targeted social interventions. There is no evidence that their decision to withhold reward is punitive; it is uniformly applied and not contingent on others’ actions. They are thus best described as a “non-rewarding cooperator”: they help via public good contributions but do not invest in second-order cooperation through reward.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nNo rewards are given to this player, so their response to being rewarded is unknown. There is no evidence about whether they would reciprocate rewards, form alliances with rewarders, or shift behavior after receiving recognition. Given their general pattern, the safest characterization is that their contribution behavior likely remains stable and high regardless of social reinforcement, but this is inferred with low confidence and not directly observed."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThe player is a strongly cooperative, near-unconditional high contributor. After an initial mid-level contribution, they shift rapidly to full contributions and then maintain them with no visible sensitivity to minor deviations by others. Their behavior fits a “principled cooperator” type more than a purely payoff-maximizing one: they continue to give the maximum even when others start reducing their contributions and even though the marginal per-coin return is below 1. They appear to accept a norm of full contribution once it is established and do not adjust downward in response to small free-riding. There is no evidence of strategic under-contribution, experimentation, or tit-for-tat style conditionality. Fairness seems defined as “everyone gives the maximum,” but they uphold that norm by example rather than by sanction or exit. Risk tolerance toward being exploited is relatively high: they keep contributing maximally despite seeing at least one group member contribute substantially less at times. Overall, they act as a stable, norm-following cooperator whose contribution pattern is simple, predictable, and robust to small norm violations.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThe player does not use the chat channel at all; their style is fully silent. They neither initiate coordination nor verbally endorse others’ calls for cooperation, even when those calls align with their contribution behavior. There is no direct persuasion attempt, no explicit signaling of expectations, and no observable responsiveness to messages from others in textual form. Their engagement style is therefore low-visibility and action-based: they “speak” only through consistent high contributions. Socially, this suggests either preference for minimal communication, deference to others’ role as coordinators, or low value placed on verbal enforcement of norms. Their silence also means their beliefs about others’ intentions or about the game’s remaining length are unknown; those must be inferred solely from contribution and reward behavior.\n\n<REWARD>\nThe player almost never uses the reward mechanism, despite frequent opportunities and repeated high cooperation by others. On the one occasion they do spend on reward, they simultaneously receive an equal amount of reward from someone else. Because the system is symmetric in cost and benefit, this act is net-costly and not individually profitable, so it is unlikely to be purely self-interested. However, with only a single instance and no information about the specific target, their underlying rule is uncertain. Possible interpretations include: a tentative or experimental use of the mechanism; a one-off attempt at positive reciprocity; or a weak tendency to reinforce cooperative norms. The very low frequency of reward usage indicates that, in practice, they rely primarily on direct contribution rather than on incentive engineering. They do not appear to systematically reward high contributors, to punish low contributors via withheld reward, or to structure long-run incentives. Their default is non-rewarding cooperation, with at most a minimal, sporadic use of rewards.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThe player receives reward only once and does not alter their already-high contribution pattern afterward, so there is no clear behavioral shift in response. There is also no evidence of sustained reciprocal rewarding: they do not develop a visible pattern of rewarding in return across multiple opportunities. Because rewarders are identifiable but individual reward flows are not shown here, it is unknown whether their single use of reward targets whoever rewarded them or someone else; thus, their tendency toward direct reciprocity or alliance-building via reward is unclear. What is observable is that their core cooperative policy is stable and apparently not contingent on being rewarded. They maintain high contributions before and after being rewarded and do not escalate their reward activity. This suggests that appreciation or dependence on external reinforcement is low; they behave more like a self-motivated cooperator whose actions are guided by internal norms rather than by reward-based relationships."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a highly stable, strict full cooperator once coordination on high contributions is achieved. They start with a substantial but not maximal contribution, then quickly shift to and maintain the maximum possible contribution for the remainder of the game, regardless of small deviations by others. Their behavior suggests a strong efficiency norm: they prioritize maximizing group payoffs over personal short-term gain, even when the marginal per-coin return from the public good is below 1 for the contributor. They do not exhibit conditional cooperation in a fine-grained sense; instead, they appear to adopt a simple rule: once most others are fully cooperating, they contribute fully and stay there, tolerating minor free-riding rather than adjusting downward. They show no visible concern for personal exploitation by occasional lower contributors and display no evidence of strategic endgame defection. Risk tolerance seems moderately high in social terms: they are willing to commit to full cooperation early and persistently without first testing whether others will reciprocate beyond an initial partial contribution. Fairness considerations are present but weakly enforced behaviorally: they advocate for equal, maximal contributions but do not change their own contributions when others briefly deviate, suggesting they care more about achieving and maintaining an efficient, cooperative norm than about punishing slight unfairness.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThe player uses brief, directive, pro-cooperation messages aimed at group coordination rather than relationship-building or emotional expression. Their tone is straightforward and mildly exhortative, focused on instructing others to contribute as much as possible for collective gain. They re-emphasize the same cooperative prescription rather than engaging in back-and-forth dialogue or tailoring messages to specific individuals, indicating a low-verbosity, broadcast style rather than interactive conversation. They support and reinforce emerging cooperative norms once they see others aligning with high contributions, but they do not elaborate arguments, explain payoffs in detail, or attempt nuanced persuasion. Their communication shows low responsiveness to others’ specific chat content; they acknowledge the cooperative frame set by others implicitly through their actions, not through direct replies. Overall, they engage enough to signal intentions and set norms, but they do not invest in ongoing social negotiation or conflict management via chat.\n\n<REWARD>\nThe player never uses the available reward mechanism despite consistently high contributions from others and a highly cooperative environment. This suggests a strong preference for conserving personal resources over engaging in costly positive reciprocity; they appear to believe that explicit rewards are unnecessary when cooperative norms are already in place. They do not use rewards strategically to stabilize cooperation or to encourage specific deviators back to the norm, even when minor deviations occur. This may indicate either that they see contribution behavior itself as sufficient mutual support, or that they do not integrate the reward tool into their strategy at all. Their non-use of rewards implies low propensity to engage in second-order cooperation (paying a cost to reinforce cooperative behavior) and a tendency to rely on direct contribution choices rather than meta-level incentives. Their behavior gives no evidence of gratitude signaling through rewards, nor of targeted reinforcement, so their reward strategy is best characterized as consistently inactive or unused.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nUnknown. The player never receives any rewards in the observed game, so there is no evidence about how they respond to being rewarded, whether they would reciprocate toward specific rewarders, or whether they would adjust their contributions or social stance in response. Their reciprocity toward identifiable rewarders, potential alliance-building, or gratitude signaling patterns therefore remain of low-confidence and cannot be inferred from this transcript."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a consistent high contributor once mutual cooperation emerges. They start at a moderate contribution, immediately move to full contribution when they observe group alignment, and then maintain maximal giving with almost no fluctuation. Their behavior indicates a strong preference for efficiency and group-optimal outcomes over short-term individual gain. They appear conditional: willing to contribute maximally when others do so, and they do not reduce their contribution even when one peer starts to contribute less, suggesting tolerance for minor deviations and a reluctance to retaliate or slide into defection. They show no evidence of actively exploiting higher contributors. Fairness seems important in the sense of “everyone should contribute high,” but they do not try to enforce this through their own contribution decisions. Risk tolerance appears moderate-to-high: they commit to full contributions despite uncertainty about the game length and without direct information about others’ payoffs, implying trust in the cooperative norm once established.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThey communicate rarely but in a way that aligns with cooperative norms. Their only observed message explicitly supports another player’s call for maximum contributions, using brief, polite language that signals agreement and group endorsement rather than issuing original instructions or threats. This suggests a supportive, affiliative style, more inclined to reinforce existing coordination than to lead or challenge. They do not engage in side conversations, emotional reactions, or complaints when others temporarily deviate. Responsiveness is present but minimal; they acknowledge and back up others’ pro-cooperation messaging without attempting to micromanage or negotiate detailed strategies. Overall, they exhibit a low-talk, high-cooperation profile: engaged enough to show alignment, but not reliant on communication to guide their own behavior.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey never use the reward mechanism at any point, despite frequent opportunities and despite others consistently contributing at the same high level as they do. This indicates a strong reluctance to spend own resources to provide direct incentives or expressions of gratitude, at least under a one-to-one cost-benefit structure where rewarding does not increase social surplus. Their non-use of rewards does not appear retaliatory or selective; it is a blanket strategy. This is consistent with a payoff-conscious cooperative type who sees reward as individually costly and socially neutral in this implementation, and therefore unnecessary. It may also reflect a belief that stable high cooperation among peers does not require additional reinforcement, or a preference for “silent” cooperation without extra signals. Their behavior provides no evidence of using reward as a tool for alliance-building, norm enforcement, or selective encouragement.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nUnknown. They receive no observable rewards, so there is no evidence of how they respond when identified rewarders support them. Their reciprocity toward rewarders, potential alliance formation, or adjustments in contribution or communication in response to being rewarded are therefore all unknown or at best extremely low-confidence to infer."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a strict, unconditional full contributor. They always give their entire endowment to the public fund, without deviation and without needing explicit assurances from others. Their behavior indicates they understand that full group cooperation yields very high returns and they are comfortable trusting the group to maintain this standard. They do not condition their contribution level on rewards, punishments, or small deviations by others; even after a visible defection, they maintain maximal contribution rather than cutting back. This suggests a strong, stable cooperation norm rather than a reactive or contingent one. They appear risk-tolerant with respect to potential free-riding: they prioritize maintaining the cooperative equilibrium and high group payoffs over protecting themselves against occasional exploitation. Fairness for them seems to mean “everyone contributing fully,” and they act as if that standard is both expected and achievable.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nTheir tone is friendly, succinct, and cooperative. They endorse the high-contribution strategy explicitly and frame it as a shared “plan” for “big bonuses,” reinforcing group norms rather than arguing or lecturing. They sometimes ask simple clarification or coordination questions (for example about whether everyone is rewarding) and occasionally make brief motivational comments about earning more money. They acknowledge others’ coordination proposals and express agreement, even when they do not fully follow through behaviorally later. They do not challenge or confront others directly about their actions; even when someone defects, they do not call them out in chat. Instead, they use chat mainly to reinforce collective strategies, signal generosity (“I give everyone”), and align verbally with group-wide reward schemes. Their engagement style is cooperative and encouraging but low-intensity: they participate enough to coordinate, not to dominate the conversation or negotiate in detail.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey almost never use punishment and show no interest in retaliatory behavior generally. The sole instance of punishment occurs immediately after the only clear defection from full contribution. In that case, they target the lone defector and apply a substantial sanction, while leaving all other players untouched. This pattern is highly selective and consistent with a norm-enforcing motive: punishment is reserved for clear, unambiguous deviation from a well-established full-contribution standard. They do not punish anyone else at any other time, even when discussions around rewards, fairness, and earnings might have given them justification to sanction “under-rewarders.” This suggests they view punishment as a tool to deter outright free-riding on contributions, not to fine-tune fairness in the reward stage or to retaliate for low generosity. Their willingness to bear a nontrivial personal cost to punish a single defector indicates a commitment to protecting the cooperative norm, but they keep punishment rare and targeted rather than using it routinely.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey are a high, sometimes extreme, rewarder with a strong inclination toward inclusive generosity. They frequently spend significant resources to give positive incentives to others, often distributing rewards broadly and symmetrically across all cooperating peers. This behavior is consistent with a strategy of reinforcing the fully cooperative equilibrium and signaling goodwill rather than maximizing immediate personal payoff. At several points they experiment with giving no rewards or selectively rewarding just one or a few partners, suggesting some sensitivity to their own net earnings and to whether others are also rewarding. However, they repeatedly return to wide, almost egalitarian reward distributions, and explicitly describe themselves as giving to everyone. They do not appear to condition rewards on fine-grained differences in others’ behavior; as long as others are contributing fully and broadly aligned with the group, they tend to treat them similarly. The single defector receives no reward and instead is punished, showing that rewards are reserved for cooperators. Overall, they use reward as a primary tool to sustain cooperation and express solidarity, accepting short-run personal costs in exchange for maintaining a generous, high-trust environment."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a steadfast full cooperator. They always contribute their entire endowment and never deviate, even when another player briefly free-rides. Their behavior indicates a strong internal norm that “everyone should give the maximum” and they appear to treat this norm as unconditional rather than contingent on others’ behavior. They do not experiment with lower contributions, suggesting low tolerance for efficiency loss and low interest in exploiting others. Their risk tolerance for being the “sucker” is high; they continue to fully cooperate even when others momentarily defect and when they themselves incur substantial costs through rewarding and a costly punishment episode. Fairness for them is expressed mainly at the group-efficiency level (maximizing the public fund), not through adjusting their own contribution in response to individual deviations.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nTheir communication is sparse, brief, and functional. They use chat mainly to nudge speed and share minimal information (e.g., giving a rough guess on total rounds, quickly agreeing with group plans, or acknowledging others’ comments). Their tone is neutral-to-positive and non-confrontational; they do not scold or call out others explicitly, even when they punish. They engage enough to show they are present and aligned with group goals but do not attempt to lead extensive coordination or persuasion. They follow emerging group norms more than they shape them, though they occasionally provide simple informational answers. They are responsive when directly relevant topics arise (e.g., duration, reward practices), but they do not seek emotional support or lengthy discussion. Overall, they adopt a cooperative, low-drama communication style focused on keeping the game moving and signaling agreement.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey almost never use punishment and appear reluctant to deploy it. The single observed punishment is targeted and proportional: they punish only when another player fully withholds contribution while all others continue to fully cooperate. This strongly suggests a norm-enforcing motive rather than retaliation, since their own payoff is not directly individually targeted and they have never been punished. Once the defector returns to full contribution, they immediately stop punishing, indicating that their aim is deterrence and correction, not ongoing spite. They show no evidence of using punishment to fine-tune contributions, to gain advantage, or to punish low rewarding. Their threshold for punishing seems high: only a clear, salient violation (taking everything for oneself while the group is fully cooperative) triggers action. They remain anonymous and silent about it in chat, supporting the view that they prefer minimal social confrontation while still being willing to enforce the cooperation norm when it is blatantly breached.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey are a generous and sometimes heavy user of rewards, with a clear pro-social orientation. They repeatedly spend substantial amounts to reward multiple or all other players, especially when group contributions remain maximally cooperative. They favor broad, symmetric reward distributions: when they do reward, they typically reward everyone who is cooperating, not selectively favoring particular partners. This implies a strong preference for fairness and group-wide reinforcement of the high-contribution norm, rather than forming cliques or reciprocating only towards those who rewarded them. They do occasionally vary their reward intensity, sometimes giving nothing, sometimes rewarding a subset (notably a player who had previously complained about not receiving rewards), which suggests some responsiveness to others’ expressed experiences of fairness and loss. They also engage in reward even when it is personally costly and not clearly profit-maximizing unless others also reward; nonetheless, they do not insist or coordinate aggressively around mutual rewarding, and at times decline to reward even when others argue it would raise group payoffs. Overall, they use rewards as a cooperative signal and as positive reinforcement for norm adherence, but they do not rigidly reward every round and appear to balance cost considerations with their desire to be fair and supportive."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a stable, unconditional high contributor. They consistently give the full endowment to the public fund in every observed round, with no downward adjustment even when one partner briefly deviates. Their behavior suggests a strong norm of full cooperation that does not depend on short‑term payoffs or others’ minor lapses. They appear to reason that contributing maximizes group earnings and accept that as the default, rather than testing or hedging. There is no evidence of risk aversion regarding potential free‑riding; they tolerate at least some risk of others under‑contributing without cutting back. Fairness for them centers on “everyone giving the maximum,” not on calibrating their own contribution to track others’ behavior. They are highly predictable and non‑volatile on this dimension.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThey are socially engaged, expressive, and responsive. Their tone is friendly and cooperative, with occasional light humor and self‑disclosure about waiting time and earnings. They openly share their feelings when they perceive imbalance, for example noting that they have rewarded others while not receiving as much in return and later explaining that this made them lose relative to the group. They use chat to clarify misunderstandings, to correct small mistakes in what they typed, and to explain their decisions (such as when they decide to stop or resume rewarding). They attend to others’ suggestions about coordination (e.g., about using rewards) and engage in the discussion rather than ignoring it. They also show some capacity for basic payoff reasoning in communication: they explicitly articulate the net gain from symmetric reward exchange when everyone participates, and they frame reward decisions in terms of group earnings. Overall, they pursue consensus and mutual understanding, rather than confrontation or withdrawal.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey never use punishment despite having repeated opportunities and at least one clear instance of under‑contribution by a specific partner. There is no sign of retaliatory intent or desire to impose costs on others, even when they personally earn less because others are not rewarding them as much. Their response to perceived unfairness is to communicate and adjust their own rewarding behavior, not to punish. This pattern suggests either a principled aversion to harming others, a belief that punishment is unnecessary in a highly cooperative group, or a perception that punishment is not an efficient way to increase earnings. Because they encounter very little defection overall, it is unknown how they would behave under more severe or persistent free‑riding; however, within this environment, they are a non‑punisher who relies exclusively on positive or neutral responses.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey are an active, often generous rewarder, using rewards as a primary strategic and social tool. Early on, they reward broadly across cooperative partners, sometimes covering nearly everyone, and they do this even when it makes them temporarily worse off in net coins. They openly express disappointment when others do not reward them back and explicitly state that this asymmetry caused them to lose relative to others, indicating that they track payoff consequences and care about reciprocity. Over time, their reward pattern becomes more selective and episodic: they alternate between rewarding many partners, rewarding only a subset, and occasionally not rewarding at all. These adjustments correlate with their expressed concern about “losing” when others do not reciprocate, implying that they condition their generosity on perceived group reciprocity and coordination.\n\nThey clearly understand the efficiency logic of symmetric rewarding and even articulate a simple “if everyone gives, we all earn more” calculation. In practice, they sometimes withhold rewards when they believe not everyone is participating or when they feel under‑rewarded, then resume rewarding after mutual assurances from others. Their use of rewards thus mixes altruistic reinforcement of cooperation, desire for fairness and reciprocity, and explicit payoff optimization. They never use rewards to single out defectors for exclusion; instead, they mostly direct rewards toward consistently contributing partners, occasionally omitting or including different subsets without obvious hostility. Overall, they are a “pro‑social reciprocator with positive reinforcement bias”: willing to spend to reward cooperation, but gradually sensitive to whether the reciprocal reward norm is actually being followed."

Their behavior is completely stable and does not respond to small payoff differences, delays, or others’ minor deviations; they continue to fully contribute even when one peer briefly free-rides. They appear motivated by group efficiency and mutual gain rather than narrow payoff maximization, and they seem to assume that full cooperation is both achievable and natural. They tolerate the risk that others might not match their effort and do not hedge their contributions in response to uncertainty about remaining rounds or others’ future behavior. Fairness for them is “everyone gives all,” with an expectation of symmetry, but they do not condition their own contributions on whether this expectation is perfectly met.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nTheir tone is cooperative, direct, and lightly expressive (e.g., mild complaints about waiting and delays), without hostility. They engage early to greet others and quickly propose a simple, efficient group norm. They participate in small talk around waiting time, showing willingness to socially bond, but they keep messages short and focused on coordination or clarification. They attempt to steer group strategy, especially regarding reward usage, and they explicitly reason about joint payoff gains from mutual rewarding. They show responsiveness to others’ concerns (apologizing when someone feels overlooked by rewards and later compensating them) and demonstrate an understanding that successful reward schemes require everyone’s participation. They are comfortable making explicit “everyone do X” calls, especially toward the end, and align their comments with the idea of collective benefit rather than personal advantage.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey never use punishment, even when there is a clear, isolated case of zero contribution that lowers group returns. There is no evidence of latent punitive tendencies: they do not threaten punishment, do not discuss it, and do not appear to consider targeting the one-time free-rider. This suggests a strong preference for positive-sum tools over negative ones, and an avoidance of retaliation or deterrence through loss-infliction. If they hold any punitive norms, they do not act on them here; they rely on contribution norms, coordination, and rewards instead. Their default is non-punitive, even when punishment could be rationalized as enforcing fairness or protecting group outcomes.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey are selectively but genuinely willing to reward, and they understand the positive efficiency of mutual rewarding. Early on, they experiment with broad, near-uniform rewards across the cooperative group, accepting a short-term personal cost to reinforce a fully cooperative environment. Over time, they reduce reward usage, possibly because others do not consistently reciprocate or because the group already maintains full contributions without it. When someone expresses feeling disadvantaged by others’ lack of rewarding, they respond both verbally and behaviorally by directing additional rewards to that person, which functions as targeted support and acknowledgment. Near the end, they explicitly advocate for a coordinated, symmetric reward scheme that would increase everyone’s payoff if universally adopted, showing that they view rewards as a tool for mutual gain rather than as gifts or favoritism. They do not use rewards strategically to manipulate defectors; instead, they reinforce cooperators and try to organize group-level reward norms."

They consistently contribute nothing in every decision, regardless of others’ behavior, the average contribution level, or changes in group size. Their strategy does not exhibit exploration or adjustment; it is a fixed rule rather than a reactive or conditional approach.\n\nThey appear to reason in payoff-maximizing terms given the game’s structure: the marginal per-capita return is below 1, so keeping the full endowment strictly dominates contributing from an individual-profit perspective. Their behavior aligns with a purely self-interested best response in a linear PGG without punishment or reputation consequences.\n\nThey do not follow reciprocity or fairness norms. They continue to free-ride even when others are clearly contributing very high amounts and could plausibly expect mutual cooperation. The player shows no tendency to “reward” cooperative episodes with partial giving, nor to “sanction” low-contribution periods with any change in their own behavior; they simply ignore these social signals.\n\nRisk tolerance in contribution space is effectively irrelevant for them because they never stake any coins on the public fund. This indicates either high aversion to downside risk for oneself, complete disregard for group payoffs, or both. Given that they repeatedly enjoy high returns generated by others without ever sharing costs, they are comfortable benefiting from positive externalities with no evident guilt or corrective impulse (though internal motivations are unknown).\n\nThe contribution pattern is highly stable and non-volatile: there are no switches, partial contributions, or reactive spikes. This stability suggests a pre-committed strategy (“always keep everything”) rather than trial-and-error learning. Conditional cooperation, inequality aversion, or norms of proportionality are not expressed in their actions.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThe player shows no end-game shift because their baseline behavior is already full defection. They begin with zero contributions and maintain this level through the final decision. As a result, there is no visible decay or escalation in cooperation tied to the known time horizon; their play is horizon-invariant.\n\nAwareness of the number of remaining rounds does not alter their strategy in any detectable way. Since they never cooperate at any point, they have no cooperative posture to unwind as the end approaches, nor do they attempt any last-round exploitation spike (they are already exploiting the group from the outset).\n\nFrom an inferential standpoint, this is consistent with a belief that contributing is never privately optimal, regardless of stage in the game, and that others’ tendencies to contribute can be treated as an exogenous resource to harvest rather than a pattern to cultivate or preserve. Whether they consciously model others as potentially reacting to their free-riding is unknown, but their unchanging strategy implies low concern for sustaining future cooperation.\n\nIn new PGG environments with similar incentives and no effective sanctions or reputational mechanisms, this player type is expected to defect from the start and stay that way, independent of remaining rounds or observed shifts in group behavior."

They always keep their entire endowment and never contribute to the public good, despite consistently high contribution levels from most others and a relatively high marginal per capita return. Their behavior is extremely stable and shows no experimentation or conditional cooperation: they do not increase contributions when others are generous, nor do they respond to being heavily punished by changing contribution behavior. Fairness and reciprocity norms appear to have no observable influence on their choices; maximizing own private payoff from the stage game seems to dominate. They tolerate substantial social and monetary risk (including very large deduction attacks) without altering their zero-contribution strategy, suggesting either a strong commitment to free-riding, indifference to social approval, or a belief that adjustment would not sufficiently change others’ behavior. Their pattern is consistent with a rational, payoff-focused defector who treats the public account purely as an opportunity to exploit others’ cooperation.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey never spend any resources on punishment, even when they are a clear target of intense and repeated deductions and could seek to retaliate or deter future attacks. This absence holds regardless of who contributes how much or who is punished or rewarded by others. There is no sign of norm-enforcing punishment, strategic punishment to shape others’ contributions, or revenge-type punishment in response to harm. This suggests either a strong aversion to sacrificing own payoff for norm enforcement, or a belief that punishment is ineffective or not worth the cost. They accept being punished as a cost of their free-riding strategy rather than attempting to counter-punish or discipline low contributors, indicating they do not see themselves as a norm enforcer and place minimal weight on reciprocity-in-kind, even in negative form.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey never reward anyone, despite consistently high contributions from many group members and extensive reward activity by others. They do not use reward to encourage cooperators, to signal gratitude, or to build alliances or goodwill that might protect them from punishment. The reward technology is relatively efficient, but they still refrain from ever using it, suggesting that any value they place on others’ welfare, reciprocity, or strategic reputation-building is outweighed by their desire to conserve own payoff each round. They do not appear to adopt a “carrot-and-stick” strategy at all; instead, they ignore the reward channel and treat others’ rewarding behavior as irrelevant for their own actions.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey are repeatedly punished and occasionally rewarded but exhibit no observable behavioral adaptation: contributions remain at zero and their use of punishment and reward remains at zero throughout. Massive deduction episodes directed at them do not change their strategy, implying either a very strong commitment to their initial plan, low sensitivity to social sanctions, or skepticism that changing would improve their longer-term outcome. They also do not copy or respond to others’ heavy use of punishment or generous reward; the variability and sometimes extreme spending by others does not trigger imitation or counter-behavior. They appear to treat others’ payoffs, punishment costs, and reward costs as background information rather than as signals to integrate into their decisions. Overall, they behave as a rigid, self-focused defector type: they free-ride regardless of group norms, do not invest in influencing others, and do not update in response to social or monetary feedback from the group."

They always keep their entire endowment and never contribute anything, despite consistently observing very high contributions from almost everyone else. Their behavior is extremely stable: there is no experimentation, no conditional cooperation, and no adjustment in response to being punished. They appear to follow a strictly self-maximizing, game-theoretic dominant-strategy logic toward the contribution decision, ignoring fairness norms and group efficiency considerations. There is no evidence of risk-taking for higher collective payoffs; they reliably choose the individually safe, selfish option even when it repeatedly provokes costly sanctions.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nAwareness of the finite horizon does not change their strategy. They maintain the same zero-contribution pattern from start to finish, including the final round. There is no observable cooperation decay because cooperation is absent from the outset; likewise, there is no last-round “grab” since they are already fully exploiting the group throughout. This suggests either a fixed rule (“never contribute”) or a belief that others’ behavior and sanctions will not shift their incentives sufficiently at any point in the game.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey never use the punishment option, even though they themselves are repeatedly and heavily punished. They do not punish either low contributors or high contributors, despite clear information about others’ actions and identities. This indicates a strong reluctance to spend personal resources on sanctioning, whether for norm enforcement, deterrence, or retaliation. Their stance is consistent with second-order free riding on others’ willingness to punish: they accept being disciplined by others but never participate in the costly enforcement system themselves. Motives for this could be strategic (preserving own payoff) or disinterest in moralistic aggression; which of these dominates is unknown.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nThey experience substantial and repeated punishments from several group members, yet their behavior remains unchanged: they continue to contribute nothing and continue to avoid punishing in return. There is no evidence of retaliatory punishment, targeted counterattacks, or even selective adjustments toward the harshest punishers. There is also no sign of compliance with the implied cooperation norm; they do not “learn the lesson” that the group is trying to teach. This pattern suggests a high tolerance for being sanctioned and/or a belief that changing strategy would not be worthwhile. Emotionally, whether they feel resentment, indifference, or confusion is unknown, but behaviorally they are non-retaliatory and non-responsive.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey never use rewards, despite persistent and often very high contributions by others. They ignore opportunities to positively reinforce cooperative partners or to signal gratitude or alliance. Given that rewards are relatively inefficient, this could reflect a payoff-focused calculation, but the absence of any token or symbolic reward also points to very low concern for prosocial signaling or relational strategies. They neither strategically reward to shape future behavior nor altruistically reward to acknowledge others’ generosity.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThey receive small rewards on occasion but do not reciprocate in any way, either by rewarding back or by increasing their contributions. Being rewarded has no visible effect on their subsequent behavior. This indicates that they do not treat rewards as part of a reciprocal exchange relationship, nor do they appear to value the implicit social gesture enough to adjust their strategy. Rewarders remain unreciprocated, and the player stays a strict free rider.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey observe others consistently investing in the public good and frequently spending additional resources to punish defectors and occasionally to reward cooperators. Despite this, they do not adapt. High cooperators often earn more than they do, especially when punishments against the focal player are strong, but the player does not move toward the more profitable cooperative pattern. This suggests either a strong adherence to a predetermined rule or low engagement with comparative payoff information. They also see that certain other players who deviate slightly from the high-cooperation norm get punished, yet they do not join these partial free riders or adjust toward any intermediate strategy. Overall, they show minimal behavioral learning from others’ payoffs, sanctions, or rewards; they remain a passive observer who lets others shape the social environment while they persist in pure first- and second-order free riding."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a calculated, opportunistic free-rider who occasionally cooperates but does not commit to any stable norm. They alternate between full contribution and full defection in a way that suggests active experimentation with payoff structures rather than moral or fairness-driven behavior. They begin by cooperating when the group appears coordinated and optimistic, but quickly show that they are willing to defect even when others are mostly or fully cooperating, capturing large private gains while still benefiting from others’ contributions. Their pattern indicates low intrinsic concern for fairness; they are comfortable taking more than their “share” when the environment allows it. They appear to understand the payoff consequences well enough to exploit high group contributions rather than treating the game naively. Their risk tolerance is moderate: they defect in socially risky moments (when cooperation is fragile), but never push that into explicit confrontation or explanation in chat. Overall, they behave as a payoff-maximizer who is willing to cooperate when convenient but defaults to self-interest once they see that others’ cooperation can be exploited.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThey are minimally communicative and socially reactive rather than proactive. They speak only a couple of times, and their contributions to chat are brief and somewhat ambiguous in tone. One remark expresses surprise at another player’s heavy use of rewards, which reads as a mixture of mild judgment or bemusement and curiosity rather than moral outrage or support. They do not make direct attempts to organize group behavior, nor do they explain or justify their own contribution choices. When others question their behavior indirectly, they do not respond. This suggests a low-engagement, low-justification style: they are aware of the social environment but do not invest effort in persuasion or reputation management. They are also not openly hostile or trolling; instead, they occupy a quiet, somewhat aloof role, letting others argue about norms and strategy while they adjust their own choices in the background.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThey show clear awareness of the finite horizon: the number of rounds is visible and referenced by others, and they are exposed to explicit “last round” talk. Their behavior late in the game, however, does not show a shift toward “cooperate for the finale”; instead, they continue to free-ride even when some others still contribute. There is no observable attempt to use the final rounds either to punish defectors (via withholding cooperation) in a principled way or to reward cooperators through their own contributions. Their end-game pattern is consistent with forward-looking self-interest rather than reciprocity or reputation building: once they recognize that coordination is unstable and others are debating whether to stop contributing, they maintain or increase their own defection. They do not comment on the approaching end directly, suggesting that horizon awareness affects their strategy but not their explicit communication.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey never spend any coins on rewards in any observed round, despite having multiple opportunities and seeing others experiment with rewarding. This strongly indicates that they either see no instrumental value in rewarding (given the technology and group behavior) or that they are unwilling to sacrifice private payoff for normative or expressive reasons. Their behavior is consistent with a simple rule: keep all reward resources for themselves, regardless of whether others contribute or reward. There is no sign that they use rewards as strategic reinforcement, as a signal of approval, or as a way to build alliances. They also do not even use small, low-cost “tokens” of reward, which suggests a robust reluctance to incur any cost for others’ benefit, at least within this incentive structure. Whether they conceptually understand reward dynamics is unknown; what is clear is that, behaviorally, they act as a strict non-rewarder.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThey receive a small, unsolicited reward early in the game, but they do not acknowledge it explicitly in chat, do not reciprocate to that specific player, and do not begin using the reward mechanism themselves afterward. This is strong evidence that they are not guided by reciprocity norms in this environment. Being rewarded does not trigger gratitude signaling, alliance formation, or even a minimal return reward. Their silence toward the rewarder also suggests low social investment: they neither thank nor criticize the rewarder, and they do not attempt to coordinate future cooperation with them. Their one notable chat remark about rewards expresses surprise at a different player’s large reward expenditure, not gratitude toward their own rewarder. Overall, they treat rewards as windfall gains rather than as part of a reciprocal relationship.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey observe others’ contributions and the use of rewards, and their limited comments focus on surprising or extreme behavior rather than moralizing about fairness. When a player spends a large amount on rewarding, they respond with brief amazement, which likely indicates that they see this as strategically or economically unusual. They do not verbally criticize defectors or praise cooperators, even when others vocally do so. Likewise, they do not join in when others complain about “greed” or “not understanding math.” Instead, they adapt their own behavior—moving toward more defection as the group becomes more fractured—without publicly aligning with either side of the emerging norm conflict. This pattern suggests that they monitor the social and outcome environment mainly to adjust their own payoff strategy, not to enforce norms or seek group harmony. They remain largely detached from others’ fortunes, neither openly gloating nor empathizing, and they do not use outcome information to build any visible coalition."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThe player fits a “quiet, profit‑maximizing free rider with occasional conformity” type. Their baseline is to keep almost all of their endowment and contribute minimally, even when others contribute fully and explicitly advocate universal giving. They do not match the prevailing norm of full contribution and never sustain high contributions across time. Their contributions fluctuate between very low and moderate levels rather than converging on a stable pattern, suggesting opportunistic experimentation rather than a principled norm.\n\nThey clearly prioritize individual payoff over group efficiency: they repeatedly choose contribution levels that maximize their private returns in the given environment, even when a stable, high‑contribution norm is visible and reinforced in chat. Occasional higher contributions appear sporadic and are not tied to any expressed reasoning or explicit coordination, so their underlying decision rule is unknown; however, those higher contributions do not persist when they see that others continue contributing high amounts regardless of their own behavior.\n\nThey show no visible fairness norm: they regularly contribute far less than the group while benefiting from others’ generosity, without any evident attempt to “make up for it” later or to track proportionality. Their risk tolerance regarding potential social sanctions is high; they free ride openly in the presence of identifiable partners and critical chat but do not adjust towards more cooperative behavior in response to social pressure alone.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThe player remains completely silent in chat throughout the game. They neither defend their low contributions nor attempt to justify or explain themselves. They ignore explicit appeals to cooperate, ignore light shaming, and do not respond to attempts to build a sense of group solidarity. This points to an avoidant or non‑engaging communication style: they do not use verbal channels for coordination, signaling, or reputation management.\n\nBecause they never speak, their sensitivity to social approval, guilt, or shame is unknown; what is observable is that they do not act to manage others’ impressions via communication. They also pass up the opportunity to influence others’ behavior through persuasion, even though others are clearly using chat to try to maintain cooperation. This suggests they rely on unilateral payoff optimization and are not inclined to invest effort in social influence.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThe player appears aware of the finite horizon but does not display a clear change in strategy at the very end: they already free ride heavily for much of the game, and they continue to do so near and at the end. There is no visible late‑game “collapse” in cooperation on their part, because they never commit to a high‑cooperation regime long enough for a decay pattern to emerge.\n\nThey do not respond behaviorally to others’ references to the game being almost finished in any distinctive way; their contribution stays low even as the game closes. Thus, any sophisticated end‑game reasoning about backward induction is hard to distinguish from their standing tendency to free ride. At minimum, they do not use the final rounds to reciprocate past generosity or repair norms; they maintain the same low‑communication, low‑contribution stance through to the last round.\n\n<REWARD>\nThe player never pays to reward anyone, despite being repeatedly exposed to a group where others are contributing generously and where the reward technology is clearly explained. They forgo rewarding even when they personally benefit a great deal from others’ high contributions and when reward could theoretically help sustain the cooperative norm that advantages them.\n\nThis indicates a strong reluctance to incur personal cost for prosocial signaling or norm support. They do not use rewards strategically to encourage others, to build alliances, or to express gratitude. Whether this is due to not valuing social reciprocity, not seeing reward as effective, or simply maximizing short‑term payoff is unknown; the only clear pattern is a consistent refusal to sacrifice coins for others’ benefit via reward.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThe player receives rewards from others at least twice but does not change their contribution pattern in a clearly cooperative direction afterward. They also do not reciprocate by rewarding in return, nor do they verbally acknowledge being rewarded. This implies very weak observable reciprocity: being rewarded does not trigger sustained higher contributions, does not elicit counter‑reward, and does not prompt any social signaling of appreciation.\n\nTheir internal beliefs about rewarders are unknown, but behaviorally they treat received rewards as windfall gains rather than as part of a reciprocal relationship. They do not appear to engage in alliance building or reputation dynamics; even with identifiable rewarders, they continue to act primarily as an individual profit maximizer rather than as a partner responding to targeted kindness."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a pure, unwavering free-rider. They always keep their entire endowment and never contribute anything to the public fund. This pattern is completely stable: there is no experimentation, no conditionality on others’ behavior, and no visible adjustment to changes in group contribution levels or punishment intensity. They behave as if the only relevant incentive is the immediate private payoff from keeping all coins, ignoring both efficiency gains from cooperation and any informal norm that contributors might be trying to establish. They do not appear to adopt fairness norms such as matching the group average or reciprocating high cooperation; they take full advantage of others’ generosity regardless of how cooperative or punitive the environment becomes. Risk tolerance regarding social sanction is high: they continue to free-ride despite being repeatedly and heavily punished, suggesting either a deliberate willingness to absorb sanctions as a “cost of doing business” or a disregard for norm enforcement.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nunknown. There is no observable chat content from this player in the transcript, so their tone, persuasion style, and responsiveness in communication are not inferable. It is unknown whether they attempt to justify free-riding, to coordinate, or simply remain silent. Engagement vs avoidance style in chat is therefore unknown.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThis player shows no discernible end-game shift. Their strategy is static: they free-ride from the beginning through the final round without any increase in contributions or strategic change as the horizon approaches. Even when the game nears its end, they do not attempt to “repair” relations with contributors, avoid punishment by briefly conforming, or exploit a final-round “grab” (they are already maximally grabbing from the start). This suggests they behave as if each round is independent or as if the only relevant consideration is short-run private income, not dynamic reputation or future consequences. They show awareness of neither cooperation decay nor last-round coordination; their pattern is flat and unresponsive to the game’s remaining length.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThis player never uses the punishment mechanism at all. Across all rounds, they spend nothing on punishing others despite facing sustained and often severe punishment themselves. They do not retaliate against those who are likely punishing them, do not try to discipline low contributors (there are others contributing zero in some periods), and do not use punishment strategically to deter future sanctions or shape group behavior. This indicates a strong reluctance or refusal to incur personal cost for norm enforcement, even when such enforcement might increase their own future payoffs by encouraging cooperation or reducing targeted punishment on them. Their motives appear purely payoff-maximizing in the short run: they avoid any costly social action, whether “prosocial” (punishing defectors) or “antisocial” (retaliating), and accept being the target rather than spending to fight back. From a type perspective, they act as a non-punishing, non-enforcing free-rider who does not invest in any form of costly sanctioning.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThis player’s behavior appears strikingly insensitive to others’ outcomes. They keep free-riding even as cooperative players suffer from heavy punishment by others, even as overall cooperation levels fluctuate, and even as their own payoff is repeatedly reduced by deductions. They do not seem to condition on who is being punished or rewarded; they do not respond when contributors are targeted, nor when other free-riders exist, nor when punishment intensity or focus changes across group members. There is no observable attempt to exploit shifts in who is being sanctioned, no strategic mimicry of higher earners, and no adaptation when their own earnings fall substantially due to punishment. This suggests either that they are not paying attention to the rich feedback about others’ payoffs and sanction patterns, or that they notice but discount it heavily relative to the simple rule “contribute nothing.” Their type can thus be characterized as a rigid, payoff-focused free-rider who neither learns from nor strategically reacts to others’ contributions, punishments, or resulting payoffs."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a pure free-rider. They consistently contribute nothing to the public fund in all situations, regardless of how much others give or how cooperative the group is. Their strategy is stable and non-conditional: they do not adjust contributions upward in response to widespread high contributions, nor downward when some others defect. They appear unconcerned with fairness norms around proportional giving, and they show no evidence of sacrificing own coins for efficiency or group benefit. Risk tolerance regarding social backlash is high; they persist in full defection despite recurrent punishment from others, suggesting they either discount the likelihood or severity of retaliation, or they value their chosen stance more than the cost imposed on them. There is no sign of conditional cooperation or reciprocity on the contribution dimension.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nUnknown. There is no chat content in the transcript, so their tone, persuasion attempts, and responsiveness in explicit communication are not observable. Their interactional style must be inferred behaviorally: they remain behaviorally unresponsive to whatever norms or expectations others implicitly express through high contributions and repeated punishment, which is consistent with a low-communication or non-coordinative stance, but this is speculative (low confidence).\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThey show no end-game decay in cooperation because they never cooperate at any point; contribution behavior remains at zero throughout. Their punishment behavior, however, remains active and sometimes intensive even in the final phase, rather than tapering off. They continue to spend nontrivial amounts on punishment, including in the last rounds, indicating they remain engaged with norm enforcement or retaliation until the very end rather than switching to a purely payoff-maximizing “take and ignore” strategy. They appear horizon-aware in the sense that the game length is visible, but they do not reduce punishment intensity toward the end; if anything, they are willing to make very costly punishment choices late, suggesting they prioritize expressing disapproval, retaliating, or enforcing their own norms over maximizing final earnings.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey are a heavy and persistent user of costly punishment while simultaneously being a full free-rider. They frequently spend substantial portions of their payoff punishing others, sometimes to the point of drastically lowering their own round earnings. This indicates that they are not payoff-maximizing in a narrow monetary sense; they accept significant personal cost in order to impose losses on others.\n\nTheir targeting is not fully inferable, but some patterns are plausible (medium to low confidence):\n- They repeatedly face punishment from others, yet they continue punishing in subsequent rounds, suggesting a strong retaliatory or spiteful component: they are willing to escalate or sustain punishment conflicts rather than de-escalate.\n- They appear to direct punishment at both low contributors and high contributors at different times (inferred from changes in others’ deductions and from the fact that they never contribute themselves). This suggests that their punishment is not driven by a standard “pro-social” norm of punishing defectors on behalf of cooperation, but more by personal grievances, perceived slights, or idiosyncratic norms.\n- They sometimes punish very heavily in rounds where others are contributing generously, which is inconsistent with classic altruistic punishment and more consistent with anti-social punishment or vendetta-like behavior.\n\nOverall, they function as an anti-social punisher: they do not cooperate yet are willing to pay materially to harm others. Their punishment does not appear to be used strategically to increase future cooperation—the group remains highly cooperative without any contribution from them, and their own behavior does not change—so deterrence of defection is unlikely to be their primary motive. Instead, motives likely include retaliation against those who punish them, expression of hostility, or an attempt to reduce others’ relative advantage.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey are repeatedly punished by others, sometimes quite heavily, but do not adjust their free-riding in response, indicating low responsiveness to social sanctions in terms of contributions. Instead of conforming, they answer sanctions with continued or escalated punishment spending, consistent with a reactive or vengeful stance: when others’ outcomes show that someone has invested in punishing, they are more likely to keep engaging in the punishment environment rather than withdraw.\n\nThey also seem sensitive to relative payoffs: they often choose to sacrifice their own earnings in order to reduce others’ payoffs, even in rounds where others are doing well and contributing a lot, which suggests some concern with not letting others “get ahead” uncontested. However, they do not alter their own cooperative behavior to improve group outcomes; their response channel is almost exclusively punitive rather than constructive. Thus, when they observe others receiving high payoffs from cooperation, their typical adjustment is to impose monetary harm, not to join the cooperative pattern.\n\nIn sum, their behavioral type combines strict free-riding with active, sometimes extreme, punishment use that is not clearly aligned with cooperative norms, and a notable resistance to learning or adjusting in response to others’ sanctioning behavior."

Their strategy is fully stable: there is no experimentation, no one-shot deviation, and no apparent conditional reciprocity. They exhibit no detectable fairness norm in favor of contributing; they accept benefiting from others’ contributions while giving nothing in return.\n\nThey appear to understand the incentive structure and exploit the fact that others sometimes contribute. They are willing to let others bear all the contribution cost and simply collect the redistributed benefit when available. When others stop contributing, they still do not change course, indicating that they value maximizing their own short-term payoff per round over any group-efficiency or fairness concerns. Risk tolerance regarding future group retaliation is irrelevant here because punishment/reward is disabled; within this environment they behave as if there is no strategic cost to being blatantly selfish.\n\nOverall, their type aligns with a payoff-maximizing, non-cooperative defector who does not condition on others’ past or current contributions.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThere is no discernible end-game shift in strategy because the player defects from the very beginning and maintains that strategy through to the very last round. Awareness of the remaining rounds does not visibly alter their behavior; they do not “coast” into defection after early cooperation because cooperation never occurs at all.\n\nIf anything, the consistent refusal to contribute, even when others continue to do so late in the game, suggests that they treat every round as an independent opportunity to free-ride rather than part of a broader relational or reputational horizon. They show no sign of last-round generosity or symbolic reciprocity. Their horizon awareness is behaviorally irrelevant given their already fully non-cooperative baseline.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThis player’s contribution pattern is completely insensitive to others’ outcomes. They continue to free-ride when others contribute heavily and earn lower net payoffs than them, and they also continue to free-ride when others contribute nothing and everyone earns the same. They never respond with increased cooperation when others sacrifice for the group, nor do they attempt to sustain mutually beneficial high-payoff states through their own contributions.\n\nThe player appears comfortable with systematic payoff advantages over more cooperative others and does not adjust to reduce inequality. Likewise, when others also defect and their relative advantage disappears, they still do not contribute to restore higher joint payoffs. This suggests they either prioritize absolute self-payoff over group efficiency and equality, or they are indifferent to both others’ payoffs and the collective surplus, focusing narrowly on keeping their own endowment each round. Their beliefs about others’ motives and preferences are unknown; all that is observable is a consistent lack of behavioral response to social or payoff information."

Across the game, they usually keep their entire endowment and rely on others’ contributions to generate returns. They show two isolated full-contribution choices surrounded by many zero-contribution decisions, indicating highly volatile cooperation rather than a stable norm of fairness or reciprocity.\n\nTheir default pattern is to contribute nothing even when the group contributes at a high level and continues to do so. They do not systematically match, reward, or even modestly reciprocate others’ high contributions. When they do contribute fully, it is not followed by sustained cooperative behavior; instead, they immediately revert to free-riding. This suggests their cooperative moves are experiments or hedges rather than a principled commitment to fairness.\n\nThey appear relatively insensitive to being targeted with punishment for low contribution. Despite repeatedly suffering substantial deductions after free-riding, they persist in contributing nothing. This implies either a high tolerance for risk and social disapproval or a belief that the material benefits of free-riding are still worth the occasional sanction. They do not display a clear conditional cooperation rule like “contribute when others do”: the group consistently maintains high contributions overall, but the player mostly defects regardless.\n\nFairness norms are weak or absent in their behavior. They accept profits that are clearly leveraged on others’ generosity without signaling any internal fairness correction through increased contributions afterward. Their two episodes of full contribution might reflect short-lived attempts to see whether contributing protects them from punishment or improves payoffs, rather than a stable norm shift.\n\nOverall, they behave as a strategic, payoff-focused free-rider who experiments briefly with cooperation but quickly abandons it when it does not obviously dominate in immediate material terms. They prioritize retaining their own endowment and exploiting the public fund, even under a credible threat of punishment. Their risk tolerance for social sanctions appears high, and they seem willing to incur repeated deductions rather than adopt a more cooperative, norm-compliant strategy.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThis player never uses the punishment option at any point, despite the presence of persistent free-riding by some others and despite being personally punished multiple times. They show zero willingness to spend on sanctions, even when many group members are contributing substantially more than some low or zero contributors. This indicates a strong preference to avoid the personal cost of punishing, even when doing so could, in principle, increase future cooperation or retaliate against those who harm them.\n\nTheir inaction suggests that they do not adopt a norm-enforcing or altruistic-punisher role. They do not attempt to deter low contributors, nor do they punish in retaliation for being heavily sanctioned themselves. The absence of any punitive response, even after repeated and sometimes severe deductions, implies they are not motivated by revenge or by maintaining fairness. Instead, they appear narrowly payoff-maximizing: any coin spent on punishment is viewed as an unnecessary cost.\n\nTheir lack of punishment is also non-selective: they do not target either clear free-riders or moderate contributors; they simply refrain from punishing altogether. This points toward a stable “non-punisher” strategy rather than indecision about whom to punish. They may believe that others will enforce norms if needed, or that punishing is futile or too expensive relative to the benefit; however, these beliefs are inferred with low confidence because they are never revealed directly.\n\nIn sum, this player adopts a strictly non-punitive stance: they free-ride on both others’ contributions and on others’ willingness (if any) to enforce norms via punishment, and they neither retaliate nor attempt to deter exploitation in the group."

Their motives appear purely payoff-focused rather than norm-enforcing or vindictive. Whether they conceptually support punishment as a norm-enforcement tool is unknown; behaviorally, they are a non-punisher who tolerates exploitation of their own free-riding without reaction. Their non-use of punishment holds even when doing so might plausibly deter further sanctions, indicating either indifference to strategic deterrence or low confidence/engagement with the punishment mechanism.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nWhen others impose substantial and repeated punishment on them, they do not change their contribution behavior and do not respond with counter-punishment.

They appear unmoved by others’ sacrifices for the public good or by the efficiency losses caused by the punishment system. Other players’ lower payoffs from spending on punishment do not tempt them into changing roles; they do not exploit punishers differently, nor do they attempt to align with them. Overall, they treat others’ outcomes—whether those are high cooperative payoffs or reduced payoffs from bearing punishment costs—as background information, not as guidance. Their learning from social outcomes is minimal or absent, and they maintain a stable, individually rational but socially exploitative strategy."

This points to a payoff-responsive, conditional style rather than principled adherence to either pure altruism or pure self-interest.\n\nRisk tolerance appears moderate: they are comfortable taking the “risk” of cooperating in a social environment that includes visible free riders, but they also mitigate that risk by intermittently defecting. Their willingness to cooperate even when some others do not suggests they are not purely pessimistic about others’ behavior, yet their willingness to defect after observing payoff differences shows they are alert to being exploited and will adjust accordingly.\n\nIn fairness terms, they do not enforce or follow a strict equality norm; they are willing both to be the one who earns less than free riders (by cooperating in mixed groups) and to be the one who earns more (by free riding when others contribute). This asymmetry suggests that securing acceptable personal outcomes is more central than maintaining symmetric fairness across players.\n\nOverall, the player can be characterized as a flexible, payoff-aware conditional cooperator who alternates between pro-social and self-interested choices, adapting to observed incentive patterns rather than committing to a stable cooperative identity.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThe player clearly attends to others’ outcomes, at least implicitly, as shown by their behavior aligning with changes in the payoff structure between contributors and non-contributors. When free riders are earning more than cooperators, the player is willing to join the free riders; when the payoff gap narrows or reverses in a way that weakens the attraction of free riding, they are willing to return to contributing. This pattern implies that peer outcomes inform their strategy, even though there is no direct evidence of emotional reactions.\n\nThey do not have access to punishment or reward tools in this environment, so there is no direct data on costly sanctions or positive reinforcement. As a result, their “response” to others’ outcomes manifests entirely through their own contribution level: they indirectly “reward” cooperative environments with occasional contributions and indirectly “punish” cooperative others by sometimes exploiting them through free riding.\n\nThere is no evidence that they attempt to stabilize group behavior by consistently matching the group’s average contribution level; instead, they use a coarse-grained response—switching between full cooperation and full defection—with an apparent focus on their own relative payoff. How much they care about others’ absolute payoffs or welfare beyond this relative comparison is unknown.\n\nIn terms of beliefs, their actions are consistent with expecting that at least some others will continue to contribute even when they themselves defect, and that group cooperation is reasonably robust in the short run. They seem to “ride along” with others’ generosity when it is profitable, but they are still willing to support the public good intermittently, suggesting they do not fully expect universal defection or complete collapse of cooperation.\n\nBecause the player cannot communicate or target individuals, their social style in response to others’ outcomes remains largely inferential. What is observable is a pragmatic, outcome-sensitive adjustment of their own behavior rather than any principled enforcement or strong emotional stance toward high or low earners."

Their default is to keep the entire endowment and rely on others’ contributions. The pattern is highly skewed toward non-contribution, with only rare switches to full contribution. These cooperative moves are isolated and do not convert into a new stable pattern; the player quickly reverts to non-cooperation even when others are contributing at substantial levels.\n\nThe player appears to recognize the incentive structure: they consistently choose the individually payoff-maximizing action given others’ ongoing willingness to contribute. They do not match others’ high contributions, and they accept being the main beneficiary when others act cooperatively. This suggests weak or absent fairness concerns within the game context and a low internalization of efficiency norms (they do not move toward the socially optimal high-contribution outcome even when it is repeatedly demonstrated by at least some co-players).\n\nThere is some evidence of strategic experimentation or momentary norm-following: they contribute fully on a small number of occasions despite strong evidence that free riding yields higher personal payoffs. These cooperative episodes are infrequent and not sustained, suggesting either low commitment to cooperative norms or low confidence that cooperation will be reciprocated in a way that justifies the cost.\n\nOverall volatility is low: they maintain a dominant free-riding strategy with only a couple of brief cooperative departures, not a responsive tit-for-tat or contingent strategy. Their risk tolerance for “wasting” contributions appears low; once it is clear that at least one peer systematically free rides and that contributing does not reliably improve their own earnings, they avoid further costly cooperation. They do not show evidence of using contributions to enforce norms or signal trustworthiness.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThe player is clearly aware of the game horizon: they can see how many rounds remain, and their behavior near the end is consistent with an end-game logic that favors strict free riding. As the game approaches its conclusion, they maintain or intensify their baseline non-contributory stance rather than attempting any last-moment cooperative surge. There is no sign of “final-round generosity” or symbolic cooperation.\n\nCooperation does not decay from a high baseline; instead, the baseline is already low, and it remains low through the end. Occasional earlier contributions do not blossom into a reciprocal pattern that might then unravel; rather, the player continues to choose the safer, individually rational action as the remaining number of rounds shrinks. End-game behavior is thus consistent with a backward-induction style: when future reciprocation is limited or nonexistent, there is no reason, in their revealed preference, to bear the personal cost of contributing.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThe player closely tracks that others sometimes incur substantial costs by contributing while the player benefits disproportionately. They do not respond by adjusting toward fairness or reciprocity when others earn less than them due to their own contributions. Instead, they continue to exploit these cooperative acts, suggesting low sensitivity to outcome inequality inside the game.\n\nThey also witness extended periods where at least one peer contributes regularly and another often free rides, creating a clear contrast in both strategies and resulting payoffs. The player does not align with the contributor out of solidarity, nor do they punish the free rider (not possible in this configuration), nor do they voluntarily “compensate” contributors through increased cooperation. Their main reaction to the outcome structure is to keep choosing the action that preserves or improves their own payoff, irrespective of whether others are advantaged or disadvantaged in that round.\n\nWhen everyone converges on non-contribution and all players earn the same moderate payoff, the player does not treat this equality as a cue to reintroduce cooperation. Instead, they maintain non-contribution, indicating that equality per se does not motivate them toward greater provision of the public good. Their behavior suggests that others’ outcomes matter primarily as an input to understanding what they can profitably free ride on, not as a target to equalize or as a basis for building mutual cooperation. Overall, they act as an opportunistic, low-inequity-aversion type who is comfortable benefiting from others’ costs and does not adjust contributions in response to observed payoff distributions."

The default choice is to keep the entire endowment and rely on others’ contributions, and this pattern is highly stable across the game. Contributions occur only in a small minority of rounds and do not escalate or persist; they appear as brief experiments or context-specific exceptions rather than a shift in strategy.\n\nThey do not match others’ generally high contribution levels, even when surrounded by multiple consistent cooperators. This indicates very weak adherence to fairness or reciprocity norms and a low internal weight on outcome equality. The player appears comfortable earning strictly higher payoffs than most others.\n\nTheir behavior fits a straightforward economic logic: contributing is individually costly relative to free-riding, and they act as if each decision is evaluated myopically in terms of personal payoff rather than group efficiency or social preference. Because contributions are all-or-nothing, their rare cooperative moves suggest some willingness to occasionally test or signal cooperation, but there is no follow-through when cooperation would mean sustained personal cost.\n\nOverall, they display low altruism, low inequality aversion, and low willingness to sacrifice own payoff for group benefit. Risk tolerance appears moderate: they are willing to free-ride even when many others are contributing (risking future norm-based backlash, if any existed), but because punishment/reward tools are absent here, this is effectively a low-risk strategy. Sensitivity to the marginal per-capita return is unknown, but their actions are consistent with a standard selfish best response in this environment.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThe player repeatedly observes that others’ contributions generate substantial group returns and that contributors often earn less than non-contributors, including themselves. Nevertheless, they largely maintain their free-riding strategy. This suggests they respond to others’ outcomes primarily as confirmation that exploiting cooperative behavior is profitable rather than as a prompt to join in.\n\nThey do not escalate contributions in response to high cooperative participation by others; if anything, their behavior indicates an expectation that others will continue to contribute even without reciprocal effort. When cooperative levels fluctuate, they do not systematically adjust to stabilize group welfare; instead, they continue to prioritize their own payoff, indicating low responsiveness to efficiency losses borne by the group.\n\nThere is no mechanism for explicit punishment or reward in this game, so their disposition toward spending resources to sanction or support others is unknown. However, given their reluctance to incur any cost to help others through contributions, it is low-confidence but plausible that they would also be reluctant to bear personal cost to intervene via punishment or reward in similar settings.\n\nThe player appears relatively unaffected by inequality in payoffs. When they personally benefit more than cooperators, they continue with the same free-riding pattern rather than attempting to reduce disparities. When some others shift toward more self-interested play, the focal player does not react with either “retaliatory” cooperation breakdown (because they are already mostly non-cooperative) or compensatory generosity. Overall, they come across as an individually focused, outcome-oriented type who tracks others’ outcomes mainly to confirm that their own strategy is working, not to align with social norms or fairness."

The dominant pattern is non-contribution even when others are contributing substantial amounts, indicating that maximizing individual gain outweighs concerns about equality or group efficiency.\n\nTheir few contributions occur when the group is already contributing at relatively high levels and/or when multiple peers are giving. This suggests weak conditional cooperation: they are willing to contribute when they expect the public good to be well funded by others, but they do not maintain a cooperative stance consistently, even in similar group environments. This inconsistency implies either ongoing experimentation with payoffs or opportunistic “appearances” of cooperation rather than a stable fairness norm.\n\nIn fairness terms, they tolerate and actively exploit outcome asymmetries in their favor. They repeatedly accept earning more than many cooperators without adjusting toward more equitable contributions. There is no sign that they are a strong inequality-averse or reciprocity-driven type; instead, they appear comfortable with advantageous inequality.\n\nRisk tolerance appears moderate: they do not contribute in a way that gambles on others suddenly increasing cooperation. When they do contribute, it is in situations where overall contribution levels are already robust and the risk of “wasting” a contribution on a poorly funded public good is relatively low. They avoid aggressive shifts or large cooperative gambles; their behavioral changes are sparse, not volatile.\n\nOverall, their contribution profile is stable in its free-rider orientation with rare, strategically placed cooperative acts. These acts look more like testing or conditional signaling than a commitment to sustained mutual cooperation.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThe player consistently observes others earning less than them when they free-ride and still continues to free-ride, indicating low behavioral sensitivity to others’ disadvantaged outcomes. They do not react to lower payoffs for high contributors by increasing their own contributions in a sustained way. When others’ payoffs decline along with decreasing group contributions, they do not step in to stabilize the group outcome; instead, they maintain or return to non-contribution.\n\nIn environments without explicit punishment or reward, they do not spontaneously “self-discipline” by contributing more after observing that cooperators are systematically worse off than non-contributors. This suggests that their internal response to others’ outcomes is not driven by concerns about compensating cooperators or correcting payoff imbalances.\n\nTheir occasional contributions do not reliably coincide with moments when others are especially disadvantaged, so there is low evidence that they are motivated by altruistic concern for those doing poorly. Instead, their behavior fits a belief that others will continue to contribute enough to keep the public good profitable, allowing them to largely maintain a free-riding stance. They act as if they expect at least a core of persistent cooperators, and they exploit this expectation rather than reciprocating.\n\nUnknowns: Their emotional or moral reaction to others earning less is not observable; we only see that it does not translate into a consistent behavioral adjustment. Their exact beliefs about how long cooperation persists, or whether they feel any guilt or justification for free-riding, remain unknown."

The cooperative choices appear sporadic rather than part of a stable rule like “match the group” or “reward cooperators.” They do not systematically reciprocate high group contributions, nor do they clearly exploit downturns in contributions; instead, they maintain a free-riding default with occasional deviations.\n\nThey display low adherence to fairness norms: they repeatedly accept earning more than consistent cooperators and do not appear to move toward equalizing payoffs. Their few contributions do not persist across subsequent rounds, suggesting they are not anchored by guilt, inequality aversion, or a strong fairness principle. Risk preferences are hard to infer with confidence because the action space is discrete and symmetric, but their willingness to contribute only occasionally in a largely cooperative group suggests they may be experimenting or checking payoff consequences rather than avoiding risk; confidence on this interpretation is low.\n\nOverall, their stable type is: “profit-oriented, low-commitment cooperator,” whose primary tendency is defection/free-riding, with limited, non-sustained cooperative episodes that do not reshape their long-run behavior.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThe player repeatedly observes that others who contribute more often end up with lower payoffs than themselves, yet they continue to free-ride in most rounds. This indicates that they respond more to the payoff gradient (defection is individually advantageous) than to any norm of reciprocity or mutual support. They do not move toward higher or more stable contributions even when the group’s cooperative level is relatively high for multiple consecutive rounds.\n\nThey do not appear to condition their behavior on specific individuals’ outcomes; their pattern does not track any one peer’s shifts. Instead, they seem to respond at most to the overall payoff structure: defection yields higher individual returns given the group’s contributions. When they do choose to contribute, they do not follow this with a new cooperative streak despite others still bearing costs, which suggests that any inequality they observe does not strongly motivate them to correct it. There is no discernible pattern of “rewarding” cooperative phases with sustained cooperation or “punishing” group-wide defection by withdrawing contributions; their own payoff remains the central reference point.\n\nWith no explicit punishment or reward mechanisms available, their reaction to others’ outcomes manifests only through their own contribution decisions, and those decisions show minimal pro-social adjustment. They treat others’ lower payoffs relative to theirs as acceptable collateral of the game structure rather than as a signal to change course. Their beliefs about others’ behavior are not directly observable, but their persistence in free-riding despite ongoing contributions from many peers is consistent with expecting that others will continue to contribute enough to make defection profitable."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a verbally pro-cooperation but strategically self-interested conditional cooperator–defector. Early on, they fully contribute and explicitly endorse the logic that everyone investing maximizes group payoffs, indicating they understand the payoff structure and accept full cooperation as the group norm. They publicly criticize a low contributor, signaling an expectation that everyone should contribute fully and that non-contribution is “greedy.” However, once the group has stabilized into a highly cooperative pattern, they begin to intermittently free-ride while others continue to contribute fully. These defections are not preceded by any expressed disappointment or retaliation rationale; instead, they appear opportunistic, exploiting the established norm they helped create. Their pattern alternates between full cooperation and full defection rather than gradual shading down, suggesting a simple binary strategy (all-in vs zero) rather than fine-tuned calibration. They show no visible guilt or justification when free-riding, and they even joke about their behavior when called out, indicating low internalization of fairness norms relative to material gain. They are attentive to the idea of an “end” to the game and mention “one more round,” suggesting some awareness of endpoint effects and a willingness to defect when they believe the game is near over, though they misjudge the horizon. Overall, they are willing to cooperate as long as it doesn’t preclude them from taking lucrative free-riding opportunities once a cooperative environment is in place.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nTheir communication style is upbeat, sociable, and norm-shaping. They actively initiate chat, encourage others, and frame cooperation as a shared project, using inclusive language and group-oriented slogans. They also display mild moralizing behavior, publicly labeling a low contributor as greedy, which serves both as social pressure and as a way to signal their own cooperative identity at that point. They respond to others’ questions and speculation about game length and join casual banter, indicating engagement rather than withdrawal. When their own free-riding is noticed, they do not become defensive; instead, they lean into the “chicken” persona with playful self-description, reframing criticism as humor. They also shift the conversation at one point to what participants will do with their earnings, which distances attention from immediate contribution choices and reaffirms the “we’re all gaining” narrative. Overall, they use communication to build and maintain a friendly, lightly humorous atmosphere, to promote cooperative norms early, and later to soften or deflect scrutiny of their own opportunistic behavior.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey never spend any of their own payoff on rewarding others, despite repeatedly benefiting from rewards given by others. This holds even when the group is highly cooperative and multiple players are actively using rewards to reinforce contributions. There is no instance where they reciprocate reward-giving or use rewards strategically to stabilize cooperation. Their behavior is consistent with a strictly self-maximizing view of the reward mechanism: they accept rewards but never incur a cost to provide them. This indicates low willingness to invest in positive reciprocity or reputation-building via rewards, even under anonymity where free-riding on the reward system is relatively safe. They rely entirely on others to fund the reward environment and appear content to let others bear those costs while they enjoy the extra income. This strongly suggests that, for this player, rewards from their perspective are a windfall to be received, not a tool to be deployed.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey pay attention to others’ contribution behavior and occasionally comment on it, but they do not explicitly reference others’ specific payoffs or reward expenditures. Their reaction to a consistently low contributor is to label that behavior as greedy in chat, indicating a negative normative judgment of free-riding—at least when performed by someone else. When later singled out by another player for not contributing, their response is not to correct course or justify rationally, but to respond playfully and embrace their avatar identity, effectively downplaying the seriousness of the accusation. They do not publicly acknowledge the substantial reward costs borne by certain group members, nor do they express gratitude or concern for players who spend heavily on rewarding others. Despite being a net recipient of rewards over the game, they offer no explicit verbal thanks or reciprocal reward, suggesting that others’ generosity does not substantially shift their strategy. Overall, they notice and comment on conspicuous deviations from cooperation when it is someone else defecting, but they treat both others’ heavy spending on rewards and the group’s tolerance of their own free-riding as exploitable features rather than signals that warrant changing their own behavior."

Their overall contribution pattern is highly volatile rather than stable: they move from maximal contribution to zero with no intermediate levels. This suggests they condition their behavior strongly on early-round experience rather than following a fixed rule.\n\nInitially, they act in a strongly prosocial way, choosing the most cooperative option available despite a relatively low marginal per capita return. After observing that at least one peer contributes far less yet earns a higher payoff, they cease contributing altogether and do not return to cooperative behavior. This indicates that they attend to payoff comparisons and are willing to abandon cooperation when they perceive themselves as exploited or relatively disadvantaged.\n\nThey do not appear to follow an equality-of-contribution norm once they see clear deviation from it. Instead, they pivot to a “take advantage of cooperators” stance, prioritizing their own payoff over group efficiency or fairness. Their risk tolerance in the first decision is relatively high (they risk being the “sucker” by fully contributing), but once that risk is realized in relative payoff terms, they react by fully eliminating contribution risk rather than experimenting with intermediate “tit-for-tat” levels. They show rapid, discrete updating rather than gradual adjustment.\n\nOverall, they are best characterized as a conditional cooperator with a strong payoff-sensitivity and a sharp threshold: cooperative when they expect fairness or mutual high contributions, and quickly shifting to strict self-interest when those expectations seem violated.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThe player is clearly aware of the game horizon and behaves consistently with classic end-game defection once their cooperative expectations break down. After the initial cooperative choice, they defect in all remaining periods, including the final one, and do not attempt any last-round prosocial gesture or reciprocity. There is no evidence of “warm-glow” giving or intrinsic cooperation that survives into the end game once they have switched to self-interest.\n\nTheir behavior after switching is stable: once they adopt a non-contributing strategy, they maintain it through the final period. This implies that, given a finite horizon and the absence of punishment or reward tools, they see no strategic benefit in resuming contributions, even when some others continue to give substantial amounts. The end of the game does not trigger additional decay in contribution because they are already at the minimum; instead, the horizon effects manifest in the permanence of their defection after they update their beliefs.\n\nThey thus appear to think forward-looking in a relatively simple way: when conditions for mutually beneficial cooperation are not met and cannot be enforced, they default to consistent non-cooperation for the remainder of the game. Whether they explicitly reason about backward induction is unknown, but their pattern aligns with a player who treats remaining rounds instrumentally rather than as opportunities for reputation building or norm enforcement.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThe player is clearly sensitive to the relationship between others’ contributions and payoffs. After initially cooperating more than some peers and earning a comparatively lower payoff than at least one low contributor, they pivot to a strategy that exploits others’ continued cooperation. This points to a reactive, outcome-focused orientation: when they see that low contributors can earn more than high contributors, they adopt that pattern themselves.\n\nThey do not have access to punishment or reward tools, so no direct enforcement responses are observable. However, their unilateral withdrawal of contributions functions as a behavioral “punishment” of the group: they stop supporting the public fund once they infer that free-riding is present and profitable. They do not differentiate among individuals; their response targets the entire environment rather than specific players, consistent with an undirected retaliation against perceived unfairness or naivety.\n\nEven as some peers maintain relatively high contributions later on, the player does not reciprocate or partially restore cooperation. This suggests that once others’ earlier outcomes reveal that defectors can do better than cooperators, the player updates to a cynical belief that continuing to give is strategically dominated. They appear to value not being the worst-off more than preserving high group welfare. Whether they feel moral disapproval, frustration, or simple opportunism is unknown, but their behavior is consistent with someone who tracks inequality and moves to avoid being on the losing side, even if that undermines collective gains."

They occasionally adjust upward, but remain well below the group’s cooperative levels when those are high.\n\nThey appears to follow a “pay a small amount to look/coexist as minimally cooperative” style rather than fully free-riding or fully cooperating. This suggests a weak fairness or reciprocity norm: they do not match the high contributions of others even when those are consistent, but they are also not a pure zero contributor. Their risk tolerance for “missing out” on higher mutual payoffs seems low; they reliably secure high personal payoffs by exploiting the group’s cooperation, indicating calculated self-interest. There is no strong evidence of conditional cooperation in the sense of proportional matching; any conditionality is weak or asymmetric (they are willing to benefit from others’ cooperation without reciprocating at a similar level).\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nAs the game approaches its final round, this player does not shift toward more aggressive free-riding; instead, they slightly increase their contribution while still remaining a relatively low contributor. This indicates clear horizon awareness (they know how many rounds remain) but do not exhibit the classic strong end-game decay in cooperation. The modest increase at the end might reflect a tentative adjustment to the overall decline in group contributions, an attempt to hedge or stabilize outcomes, or a low-confidence effort to sustain some cooperation even when others are reducing their input.\n\nOverall, their end-game pattern shows that they maintain their underlying self-interested strategy rather than dramatically changing behavior in response to the finite horizon.

When others contribute a lot and earn relatively less, the player continues to contribute at a low level, implying comfort with payoff asymmetries that favor them. They do not appear to be motivated by inequity aversion in a way that would reduce their advantage; there is no clear effort to sacrifice payoff to bring their earnings closer to others’.\n\nAs some peers later reduce their contributions and obtain higher payoffs through more blatant free-riding, the player does not escalate to extreme free-riding themselves, but also does not shift upward to compensate for the public good losses. Their response to changing others’ outcomes is muted: they slightly adjust contributions but keep the same general low-contribution, payoff-maximizing stance. This suggests limited emotional or normative reactivity to others’ gains or losses and a relatively stable, self-focused strategy. Any inferences about their internal beliefs, moral judgments, or feelings beyond this behavioral stability are unknown or low confidence."

Their baseline is to contribute nothing, and this pattern is stable over almost the entire game. This indicates a strong tendency toward individual payoff maximization and a willingness to benefit from others’ cooperation without matching it.\n\nThey do eventually make a full contribution, but only after repeatedly experiencing the benefits of others’ giving while personally free-riding. Even in the one instance of full contribution, the outcome leaves them at a relative disadvantage compared to non-contributors, suggesting that they do not time this move to maximize their own payoff. This makes the final cooperative act look less like a tightly optimized exploitation strategy and more like a late, somewhat miscalibrated attempt to participate in cooperation or test a different approach.\n\nTheir contribution behavior is conditional in a weak, lagged sense: they do not reward high cooperation by joining early, nor do they clearly punish declines in cooperation with further defection, because they are already defecting. Instead, they hold a persistent non-contribution stance in the face of both relatively high and declining group contributions, only deviating once without an obvious payoff-based trigger. This suggests either limited strategic sophistication, low attention to dynamic optimization, or a simple heuristic like “default to keeping my coins; maybe contribute once.”\n\nThey show no evidence of fairness-driven norms such as “matching the group average” or “taking turns” with contributions. They are willing to earn more than generous contributors when free-riding and willing to earn less than defectors when they finally contribute, implying that relative payoff concerns are not consistently guiding their actions. Risk tolerance is hard to infer with high confidence: choosing to defect in a setting where many cooperate is low risk and high payoff, while the late full contribution exposes them to the risk of being the “sucker.” Overall, they are more payoff-focused than risk-focused, but the timing of the cooperative move is, at best, only weakly rational from a risk–return perspective.\n\nIn summary, their default type is: self-oriented free-rider with a single, somewhat opaque cooperative deviation, low adherence to fairness norms, and only weak, delayed sensitivity to the cooperative environment.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThis player observes that others frequently contribute and often receive lower payoffs than they do when they defect, yet they do not respond by joining early cooperation or by stabilizing cooperation later. Their reaction to others’ outcomes is thus largely exploitative in practice: they continue to free-ride while the group provides a strong public good, and they do not incur any cost to support or protect high contributors.\n\nThey never have access to punishment or reward in this game, so direct behavioral responses via sanctions or bonuses are impossible to observe. However, their contribution choices in the face of others’ payoffs serve as an indirect measure of their social response. When others’ generous behavior yields them high personal payoffs, they continue to defect rather than reciprocate, indicating a low tendency toward gratitude-based or reciprocity-based adjustment. When some others reduce their contributions and overall outcomes fall, they still maintain defection, suggesting limited conditional cooperation or moralistic response to declines in public-good provision.\n\nTheir one cooperative move does not clearly align with an apparent change in others’ outcomes that would make cooperation especially attractive or justified; it places them in a worse relative position compared to free-riders. This suggests that, if they are responding to others’ outcomes at all, they are doing so in a noisy or poorly calibrated way—perhaps experimenting, perhaps briefly conforming, but not in a way that systemically rewards or stabilizes cooperation.\n\nThere is no observed effort to manage inequality in payoffs. They are comfortable benefiting when cooperators earn less than them, and they also tolerate earning less than defectors later without clearly reversing course. This combination points to a player who is not strongly inequality-averse and who does not consistently adjust behavior to protect either their dominance or their status relative to others.\n\nOverall, their implicit response to others’ outcomes is: tolerate and exploit others’ cooperation for personal gain; do not systematically reciprocate high contributions; show at most a weak, one-off cooperative response that does not reliably encourage or reward others’ behavior. Their beliefs and emotional reactions to others’ outcomes remain unknown, but their behavioral pattern fits a mostly self-interested, low-reciprocity type."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is best characterized as a predominantly selfish free-rider with a brief, exploratory deviation toward cooperation.\n\nThey consistently choose the individually payoff-maximizing option of keeping their entire endowment when possible. Their modal behavior is to contribute nothing while benefiting from the contributions of others. The one instance of contributing their full endowment appears atypical rather than a stable preference; it looks more like a test of what happens if they cooperate than a genuine shift in strategy.\n\nTheir pattern suggests low adherence to fairness or equality norms. They repeatedly position themselves on the high-earnings side relative to contributing peers and do not persist in cooperative behavior even after observing that the group continues to supply public contributions. The solitary cooperative move is not followed by any sustained attempt to share the burden of funding the public good.\n\nThey show conditionality that is weak and short-lived. After initially free-riding while others contribute substantially, they briefly switch to full contribution once it is clear that many group members are willing to put in resources. However, when this cooperative act predictably reduces their own payoff relative to other non-contributors, they immediately revert to full free-riding and maintain that stance. This indicates that their conditional cooperation, if any, is highly sensitive to immediate personal payoff comparisons rather than to group outcomes or norms.\n\nThey are payoff-focused and risk-averse to personally costly cooperation. When cooperation involves a clear relative loss compared to defectors, they abandon it and show no sign of experimenting further. They do not appear to take altruistic or “investment” risks for the sake of the group; the one cooperative act is quickly “corrected” once it proves individually disadvantageous.\n\nOverall, their contribution rule in similar environments is likely:\n- Default: contribute nothing.\n- Possible exception: briefly test full contribution early or midstream if others seem cooperative, but discontinue if this harms relative payoff.\nThey do not show gradual adjustment or intermediate contribution levels here (only all-or-nothing is available), but given their reactions, if partial contributions were allowed, they would likely choose low or zero levels unless doing more clearly protects or improves their own relative standing. Confidence in this extrapolation is moderate.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThe player pays close implicit attention to payoff rankings and uses them to guide behavior. After seeing that defectors earn more than contributors under the existing group pattern, they align themselves with the better-paid group (the non-contributors) and remain there. Their one cooperative act is immediately followed by a shift back to free-riding once it yields a lower payoff than that of non-contributors while still leaving contributors in the group.\n\nThey show no evidence of reciprocity toward high contributors in terms of adjusting their own behavior to protect or reward them. Even when others continue to invest in the public fund alongside clear non-contributors, this player chooses to remain in the advantaged defector position. This suggests low concern for inequality that favors them and little inclination to incur costs to support cooperators.\n\nThere is no punishment or reward mechanism in this environment, so direct enforcement responses cannot be observed. However, their behavioral adjustments indirectly “reward” free-riders (by joining them and confirming that defection is payoff-maximizing) and “penalize” cooperators (by refusing to share the contribution burden). This is consistent with a competitive or at least self-centered orientation: they appear more motivated by maintaining a favorable payoff position than by maximizing group welfare.\n\nThey exhibit rapid learning from outcome feedback: a single experience of being worse off than defectors while contributing is sufficient to shift them back to defection and keep them there. There is no sign of longer-term experimentation with different strategies to see if group outcomes improve; outcome sensitivity is short-horizon and self-focused.\n\nTheir likely response pattern in new PGGs is:\n- Track whether cooperators earn more or less than defectors.\n- If defectors are doing at least as well or better, continue to defect.\n- If cooperation were somehow tied to strictly higher personal payoffs, they might be willing to cooperate instrumentally, but not out of principle.\n\nTheir personality style, as inferred from outcomes, is instrumental and self-regarding rather than norm-driven or pro-social. They are responsive to others’ outcomes mainly as signals for how to secure or preserve their own advantageous position. Concern for relative payoff and avoidance of being the “sucker” being exploited by others’ defection are prominent; concern for mutual benefit beyond their own gain is weak or unknown but likely low."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a generally high contributor who alternates between full cooperation and moderate free-riding. They often give the entire endowment or half of it, rarely contributing very little. Their pattern suggests conditional cooperation: they appear more willing to give fully when others are also giving high amounts, and they reduce to a mid-level contribution when they either test or exploit a cooperative environment. They are not purely self-sacrificing; they balance own payoff with group returns and sometimes keep a substantial portion despite others’ full cooperation. Their behavior indicates awareness that high group contributions are profitable, but they are willing to deviate downward when they can still benefit from others’ generosity. Contribution choices are somewhat volatile but within a narrow band (medium vs. maximum), hinting at experimentation or mild strategic adjustment rather than random play. They appear comfortable taking advantage of a cooperative norm at times, but not to the extreme of contributing nothing. Their risk tolerance is moderate: they repeatedly invest heavily even after seeing others defect or fluctuate, implying they are willing to risk being the “sucker” occasionally to preserve or regain high group payoffs.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThe player communicates very little and only engages once the group has already established a norm and called attention to their behavior. They respond briefly and directly when someone questions their contribution, using a short reassurance that implicitly acknowledges group expectations and seeks validation. They do not initiate coordination proposals, explanations, or persuasion; they let others lead the norm-setting discussion. Their tone is cooperative and non-confrontational; there is no sign of irritation or defensiveness, and they appear willing to align with the group once attention is on them. Overall, they adopt a low-visibility, reactive communication style: they monitor the chat, intervene minimally, and only speak when socially prompted.\n\n<REWARD>\nThe player uses rewards sparingly and selectively. They are willing to spend on rewards but do so infrequently, suggesting that they reserve rewarding for specific situations rather than routine reinforcement. Their first use of rewards occurs in a context where cooperation is already very high, indicating that they may use rewards more as a signal of appreciation or encouragement than as a tool to change poor behavior. They do not systematically reward every instance of strong cooperation, nor do they appear to run a consistent “reward-the-highest-contributor” strategy. They receive rewards in several cooperative contexts, which may reinforce their sense that contributing relatively high amounts is socially approved, but their own rewarding does not clearly escalate in response. Overall, they show a moderate willingness to reward, with no evidence of targeted strategic reinforcement or explicit gratitude signaling beyond the bare act of rewarding itself. Their reward behavior suggests they tentatively support prosocial norms but prioritize conserving their own payoff over actively incentivizing others."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a mostly cooperative, mildly opportunistic contributor. They usually choose the fully cooperative option when group cooperation appears strong and stable. Their default is to match or support a high-cooperation environment rather than free ride on it. However, they are not a pure unconditional cooperator: when there is visible defection by others and the cooperative norm looks less secure, they are willing to withhold contribution at least once. This shift indicates conditional cooperation with some tolerance for exploiting a perceived breakdown in norms.\n\nThey do not experiment with mixed or intermediate strategies (where available) and instead treat contribution as a binary norm decision: either fully join the cooperative majority or fully opt out. Their behavior suggests moderate risk tolerance in early and mid game, as they continue to contribute fully despite observing at least one clear defector and no guaranteed individual-level enforcement. At the same time, they are sensitive to fairness: once multiple group members defect and the cooperative standard feels less universal, they temporarily switch to free riding.\n\nOverall, their contribution pattern fits a “norm-first, but not self-sacrificial” type: they want the efficient cooperative outcome when others are on board, yet they are prepared to deviate if they perceive that others are undermining that norm.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nunknown. There is no observable chat content or turn-taking in communication in the transcript, so their tone, persuasion style, and responsiveness to others’ messages cannot be inferred.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThis player shows clear awareness of the game horizon and treats the final stage differently from the immediate prior period. After testing or exploiting a lapse in cooperation shortly before the end, they revert to full cooperation at the final opportunity when everyone else is also cooperating. This pattern is inconsistent with a pure backward-induction “defect at the end” logic and is more consistent with either norm-maintenance or payoff-salience at the final stage.\n\nThey appear responsive to the current social environment in the end game: seeing universal or near-universal cooperation, they align with it instead of taking a last-moment free-ride. This suggests that, near the end, their behavior is shaped more by a desire to conform to an established cooperative standard and secure the efficient outcome than by a short-term temptation to defect. Their cooperation does not decay as the end approaches; if anything, it recovers after a brief deviation, indicating either learning from negative feedback or a deliberate choice to leave on a cooperative footing.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey never use the punishment mechanism, despite at least some opportunities where punishing low contributors might be a straightforward norm-enforcing response. This strongly indicates a reluctance to spend their own resources to sanction others, even when punishment is highly cost-effective in terms of imposed loss versus personal cost.\n\nTheir non-use of punishment occurs even when they themselves are targeted by punishment from others. They do not retaliate or engage in second-order punishment, suggesting they are either indifferent to such sanctions, strategically focused on preserving their own payoff, or unwilling to escalate conflict. Their behavior fits a “non-punishing conditional cooperator”: they adjust their own contributions in response to others’ behavior instead of using the formal sanctioning tools to deter or correct defection.\n\nTheir motives for avoiding punishment could be efficiency-oriented (avoid wasteful costs), conflict-averse, or simply indifferent to enforcement; the transcript does not allow distinguishing these, so this is unknown.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey never use the reward mechanism, even in periods of strong cooperation where rewarding could reinforce prosocial behavior. Given that rewarding is cost-neutral in expectation (one coin spent to give one coin), their abstention suggests they are unwilling to spend any resources, even break-even, to shape others’ incentives or to express gratitude.\n\nThis pattern implies a strictly self-payoff-focused approach to the sanctioning stage: they rely on their own contributions as their cooperative signal and do not engage in explicit positive reinforcement of others. They appear to treat high contributions by others as expected behavior rather than something to be actively rewarded.\n\nOverall, they resemble a “quiet conditional cooperator” who supports cooperation mainly through their own contribution choices and adapts those choices based on the group’s behavior, while systematically abstaining from both punishment and reward tools."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a conditional, alternating cooperator with a strong norm for full contributions but a willingness to free‑ride intermittently. They are clearly comfortable both fully cooperating and fully defecting rather than using intermediate or “hedging” levels when the option set is binary. Their cooperation is not purely altruistic: they sometimes exploit a cooperative group by withholding their own contribution while others continue to give. At the same time, they repeatedly return to full contribution, indicating that they value group efficiency and do not settle into persistent defection even after being punished. Their pattern suggests a mix of norm compliance and opportunism: they appear to treat full contribution as the default “right” behavior but occasionally test or exploit the environment by defecting when they may feel safe or uncertain about others. Risk tolerance appears moderate: they are willing to risk punishment and social sanctions by defecting, but they also invest in costly punishment to uphold norms, which is itself risky in payoff terms. There is no clear evidence of systematic fairness balancing over time beyond a basic expectation that everyone should contribute the maximum.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nunknown (no chat or explicit communication is present in the transcript). Their “communication” is entirely through contribution and sanction decisions, which function as implicit signals. Through these, they signal strong disapproval of non‑contributors and acceptance of full contributors but do not explicitly reward good behavior.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThey remain fully cooperative at the end of the game and do not show a decay in contribution in the final period. There is no sign of an end‑game defection spike; instead, they align with the group’s high-contribution norm right through the last round. They also stop using punishment when the group is fully cooperative, showing that they track current conditions and do not use sanctions gratuitously at the horizon. Their horizon awareness is evident in that they have full information about remaining rounds, yet they still maintain cooperation at the end, consistent with either a preference for sustaining norms regardless of horizon or a belief that maintaining a cooperative reputation matters even when there is no future interaction in this specific game (true underlying motive remains uncertain).\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey are an active, selective norm enforcer who uses costly punishment against clear free‑riders but does not employ antisocial punishment. They only target players who contribute nothing when most others are contributing fully, suggesting a focus on enforcing a simple norm: everyone should contribute fully. They do not punish cooperators, and they do not respond with retaliation against apparent punishers; their sanctions always match visible contribution deviations rather than their own payoff changes. They are willing to punish even when it is individually costly and when the offender later cooperates again, indicating a deterrence or retributive motive more than strategic payoff maximization. They also expand punishment to new defectors as they appear, suggesting attention to the entire group’s behavior rather than fixating on a single offender. They cease punishing once full cooperation is restored, consistent with instrumental norm enforcement rather than spite. Overall, they behave like a prosocial, third-party enforcer of contribution norms who tolerates some personal cost to sustain cooperation but also occasionally defects themselves, implying some inconsistency between their own behavior and the standard they enforce.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey never use the reward mechanism, despite frequent opportunities and repeated high contributions from almost all others. This indicates a strong asymmetry between negative and positive sanctions: they rely on punishment, not reward, to shape behavior. Possible interpretations include a belief that contribution is merely expected and not something to be positively reinforced, or an efficiency-minded preference to spend resources only on high-impact punishments rather than low-leverage rewards. It is also possible they regard the reward tool as unnecessary when a high-contribution norm is already in place. Their lack of reward use persists even when players who previously defected move to full cooperation, suggesting little inclination toward gratitude signaling or rehabilitative reinforcement; once behavior meets the norm, they simply withhold both punishment and reward."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a mixed, somewhat erratic conditional cooperator with a clear free-riding streak. Early on, they explicitly state an intention to increase their contribution but initially keep their own endowment, benefiting from a highly generous group. After that, they often match or nearly match the emerging “full contribution” norm, but they periodically revert to zero or partial contributions without clear public justification. They do not appear strongly principled about always contributing; instead, they oscillate between cooperative and self-interested behavior. Their giving is not tightly conditioned on specific individuals’ actions, as they keep contributing even when one identified low contributor is being criticized, and they continue to cooperate while others complain about the game length. At times they apologize for “messing up,” which suggests they recognize their deviations from group norms as suboptimal or socially undesirable, but this does not prevent later free-riding. Overall, they value payoff and are willing to exploit a high-contribution environment, but they also repeatedly participate in sustaining that environment rather than purely maximizing short-term personal gain.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThey engage in light, friendly, and somewhat humorous chat, often aligning with the group’s playful tone. They praise the group when cooperation is high and use enthusiastic language to reinforce the positive collective outcome. They speculate about the experiment design (e.g., the possibility of a “mole”) and later endorse the idea that a problematic player is “part of the study,” indicating some meta-level thinking about the game rather than pure myopic focus on coins. When they believe they have deviated from the cooperative pattern in a way that might harm the group, they explicitly acknowledge fault and apologize, showing awareness of social expectations and a desire not to be seen as undermining the group. They do not confront or criticize other specific players; instead, they stay supportive and light-hearted. They respond to ongoing banter (including slang-testing and animal-role jokes) in a way that signals social alignment but do not attempt to lead coordination or establish explicit contribution rules. Their communication style is affiliative and non-confrontational, more about maintaining group morale and belonging than about strict enforcement of norms.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey never spend any of their own coins to reward others, despite having multiple opportunities and being in a high-contribution environment where many others clearly cooperate. This holds even though they themselves receive rewards in multiple later rounds. This pattern suggests they view the reward mechanism as not worth the cost, consistent with comments by others that rewards are inefficient. Since they never reward after being rewarded, their behavior does not reflect direct reciprocal rewarding or strategic use of rewards to shape others’ behavior. Their stance appears either payoff-focused (seeing the cost as too high), or they defer to the emergent group consensus that rewards are generally to be skipped. There is no evidence that they use rewards as a social signal of appreciation or alliance-building.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThey receive rewards several times but never comment directly on being rewarded, never thank anyone, and never reciprocate through the reward mechanism. There is no verbal acknowledgment of rewarders or attempts to form a reward-based alliance. Their only explicit self-referential comment about behavior is an apology-like statement when they believe they “messed up,” which is tied to their contribution choice rather than to receiving rewards. This indicates that their main axis of social accountability is contribution behavior, not reward exchanges. In practical terms, they treat rewards as a passive benefit rather than as part of a reciprocal or relational system, and their observable response to being rewarded is effectively neutral and non-reciprocal."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a consistently above-average contributor who mixes moderate generosity with some self-protection. They rarely match the highest contributor and rarely free-ride; instead they choose contributions in the mid-to-high range relative to the endowment. Their behavior suggests a preference for cooperative efficiency, but not at any cost: they sometimes reduce contributions when others lower theirs, and sometimes increase contributions when others’ cooperation rises. This pattern indicates conditional cooperation anchored around a “fair share” norm (roughly splitting the endowment between self and group, with occasional more generous moves). They tolerate some inequality and under-contribution by others without withdrawing cooperation entirely, implying moderate rather than extreme sensitivity to fairness violations. There is no sharp end-game drop; their final contributions remain non-zero and non-minimal, indicating they do not strongly pivot to pure payoff maximization even near the end. Overall, they appear as a pro-social conditional cooperator with bounded generosity and mild risk tolerance regarding being exploited by lower contributors.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nunknown (no chat content is provided in the transcript).\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey never use punishment despite multiple opportunities, even when another player clearly contributes much less or targets them with costly sanctions. This indicates a strong reluctance to spend resources on harming others, even when it could be justified by standard fairness norms or serve as deterrence. Their non-use of punishment persists across contexts with both mild and severe free-riding and after they themselves are punished, suggesting that retaliation is not a driving motive. They appear to prioritize conserving their own payoff and/or avoiding aggressive actions over enforcing norms through negative sanctions. This strongly points to a non-punitive, non-retaliatory type who accepts some exploitation rather than escalating conflict.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nWhen another player punishes them, they do not respond with counter-punishment at any later opportunity. Their contributions after being punished vary but do not show a clear compliance pattern directed specifically at the punisher (they continue to contribute at moderately high levels in general, not obviously favoring or targeting anyone). They also do not visibly reduce their cooperation in apparent spite. This suggests they are non-confrontational and absorb punishment without overt revenge. Whether they interpret punishment as informative feedback, as random hostility, or simply ignore it is uncertain, but behaviorally they show forgiveness or at least non-escalation. They maintain their broader cooperative stance rather than shifting into a defensive or vindictive strategy.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey never use rewards, even in situations where others contribute more than them or sustain high cooperation. Given that rewards are cost-neutral in immediate effect but can serve as positive reinforcement, their non-use indicates either a general preference not to engage with sanctioning mechanisms, a belief that rewards are unnecessary or ineffective, or a desire to keep decisions simple and self-focused. They do not selectively recognize or support the highest contributors through rewards, so they are not an “active norm enforcer” via positive incentives. Their pro-sociality is expressed mainly through their own contribution choices rather than through meta-level incentives.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nunknown (they are never rewarded in this game).\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey observe others’ contributions, payoffs, and the occasional use of punishment and reward, yet they do not adopt these tools themselves nor do they sharply mimic others’ payoff-maximizing behavior. When others defect more heavily or earn higher payoffs by contributing less, they do not collapse to minimal contribution, only moderating their level somewhat. When others increase their cooperation and gain strong payoffs, they respond with generally high contributions but do not differentially reinforce anyone via reward. They also do not appear to adjust behavior specifically to avoid future punishment, as their contribution pattern remains generally similar before and after being targeted. Overall, they seem to track the cooperative climate and adjust moderately, but they are relatively insensitive to others’ use of sanctions and to short-term payoff comparisons, maintaining a stable, moderately cooperative identity rather than chasing relative advantage."

At multiple points they contribute their full endowment, indicating a willingness to prioritize group welfare, yet they also choose mid-range contributions that preserve a comfortable private payoff. Contribution levels fluctuate in response to others’ visible behavior: when partners contribute more, the player sometimes increases to full contribution; when others contribute little or free-ride, the player reduces back toward a moderate level rather than persisting at a high sacrifice. They appear to value fairness and mutual effort but not at any cost; they do not push a strict “always equal or above others” rule, nor do they clearly condition contributions on any one individual’s behavior. They tolerate some free-riding and asymmetry without sharp withdrawal. Risk tolerance seems moderate: they repeatedly risk being the highest contributor in the group, but they do not lock into that stance when it is not reciprocated.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nunknown (no chat content is provided, so tone, persuasion attempts, and direct coordination behavior are not observable).\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey never use the punishment option, even when others contribute substantially less or free-ride completely, and even though punishment is highly effective (large deductions for small cost). This indicates a strong reluctance to engage in costly negative sanctions. There is no evidence of reactive or retaliatory impulses toward low contributors or toward anyone who affects their relative payoff. They appear to prioritize keeping their own payoff and avoiding conflict over enforcing norms through harm. Whether this is driven by efficiency concerns (avoiding wasteful punishment) or by dislike of antagonism is unknown, but behaviorally they function as a non-punisher who tolerates deviations without imposing deterrence.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nThey are never punished by others, so their reaction to being targeted is unknown. There is no observable retaliation, compliance shift, or appeasement because they receive no negative sanctions.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey never reward anyone, including occasions where others contribute more than them or where a partner repeatedly benefits them via prosocial choices. Given that rewarding is payoff-neutral in this design (cost equals benefit), their refusal to use it suggests they do not adopt an active reinforcement strategy. They rely instead on passive adjustment of their own contributions, rather than using rewards to shape others’ behavior or signal gratitude. There is no sign that they attempt to form alliances via rewards or to encourage high cooperators with positive incentives.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThey receive small rewards multiple times from another player but do not reciprocate with rewards or visibly change their contribution pattern in a way tailored to that rewarder. Their cooperation level remains generally pro-social but not specifically responsive. This indicates low propensity for direct reciprocity via the reward mechanism and little interest in building dyadic exchange relationships. They also do not escalate their contributions beyond what they already do as a general cooperative baseline. Overall, they accept rewards passively without using them as a cue for special treatment.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey observe clear differences in others’ contributions, payoffs, and the presence of punishment events between other players, yet they maintain a calm, non-interventionist stance. They neither protect punished players nor join in sanctioning them, and they do not adjust contributions sharply in response to others’ gains or losses. When others benefit more than them, they do not exhibit envy-driven reduction in cooperation. When others are punished, they do not move to exploit the weakened player or compensate them. Their adjustments in contribution levels seem broadly responsive to the overall cooperation climate rather than to specific payoff shocks or sanction patterns. This suggests a player who monitors the environment but avoids direct involvement in sanction dynamics, and who maintains a baseline cooperative identity irrespective of local payoff inequalities or conflict among others."

They almost always contribute the full endowment, deviating to free ride only rarely and without clear strategic timing. Their cooperation persists despite repeated exposure to group members who sometimes withhold contributions. They do not systematically match others’ lower contributions nor escalate defection when others free ride; instead they continue to put in the maximum most of the time. This suggests they follow a simple cooperative heuristic rather than a finely tuned conditional strategy.\n\nTheir willingness to keep contributing when some others do not indicates tolerance for inequity and a relatively low aversion to being the “sucker” in the short term. There is no sign that they are experimenting with contributions to probe others’ behavior; deviations from full contribution are isolated and not followed by evident pattern shifts. They seem to value group-efficiency norms or “doing the right thing,” even when the immediate personal payoff is not maximized.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThe player communicates sparsely and in a light, self-deprecating, affiliative tone. When directly called out by another player, they respond immediately, defending their cooperative record but in a nonconfrontational way and with a touch of humor. They also explicitly express willingness to align with a group plan once they believe they understand it, signaling deference to group norms and a desire to conform rather than to lead.\n\nThey do not initiate strategic coordination proposals; instead they react to others’ initiatives. When confused about whether they are meeting expectations, they openly voice uncertainty, suggesting low defensiveness and a preference for clarity in social evaluation. Overall, they show engagement when socially addressed but avoid any aggressive or directive communication, favoring harmony and reassurance over argument.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThe player shows no strong “end-game defection” pattern. Their contributions remain high through the final rounds, including when others increasingly defect from contributing. There is no visible attempt to exploit the last rounds for personal gain by withholding contributions. If anything, they maintain or even double down on cooperative behavior despite clear signals that a subset of others is not fully cooperating.\n\nThis suggests limited horizon-based strategizing: they either do not leverage the known game length in their decision process or they choose to ignore its strategic implications in favor of stable cooperative norms. Their reward behavior also does not show a clear shift toward self-focused hoarding as the game nears completion; although variable, it remains nonzero and sometimes quite generous late in the game.\n\n<REWARD>\nThe player is a frequent, sometimes heavy user of the reward mechanism. They are clearly willing to incur costs to reward others, and they do so across many rounds. Their rewards consistently flow toward apparent cooperators and never toward clear defectors when behavior is easy to classify. They use rewards to reinforce full contributions and to support those who seem to be carrying the public good.\n\nTheir reward giving is not strictly proportional or perfectly stable: the magnitude of reward they send fluctuates. Nonetheless, the underlying principle seems to be: support group members who contribute, especially when others are also cooperating. They sometimes spend substantial amounts on rewards even when it is personally expensive relative to the immediate gain, which points to a prosocial or norm-enforcing motive rather than narrow payoff maximization.\n\nThere is no evidence they use reward in a retaliatory or manipulative way (e.g., no “withholding reward” as an explicit punishment in chat, no “bribing” language). Instead, their use of reward looks like positive reinforcement of cooperation and maintenance of goodwill.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThe player frequently receives rewards from others and appears to reciprocate at least at the group level, although specific dyadic reciprocity patterns cannot be determined with certainty from the aggregate summaries. They do not verbally thank or call out particular rewarders, so any reciprocity is behavioral rather than explicitly signaled in chat.\n\nTheir continued willingness to reward others after having been rewarded themselves is consistent with a generalized reciprocity or “pay it forward” style rather than targeted alliance formation. There is no overt attempt to create exclusive sub-coalitions; their rewards are distributed among multiple cooperators over time. They do not display resentment when rewarded less than others, nor do they respond by visibly cutting off rewards to people who previously rewarded them less. Overall, they treat rewards as mutual reinforcement of a cooperative atmosphere, not as a strict tit-for-tat exchange.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThe player appears attentive to others’ outcomes, but their reactions are mostly implicit in their contribution and reward patterns rather than in explicit comments. They do not express anger or blame in response to free riding, even when non-cooperators earn visibly higher payoffs. Instead of punishing through defection, they largely maintain their own cooperation, and they channel their response through selectively rewarding those who continue to contribute.\n\nThey seem sensitive to normative talk from others: when another player frames “everyone contribute the max” as a shared rule and later admonishes a peer in chat, the focal player does not join the chastising. Their behavior shows alignment with the cooperative norm, but their style remains non-accusatory. They do not overtly react to how much reward others spend or receive, even when some players invest very heavily in rewards. There is no evidence of envy or frustration about payoff differences; their strategy remains focused on supporting contributors and preserving mutual cooperation, rather than reacting strongly to every distributional detail."

They appear more focused on sustaining group provision with the reliable high contributors than on enforcing strict fairness norms on everyone.\n\nRisk tolerance is moderate-to-high in social terms. They consistently expose themselves to the risk that others might reduce contributions later, yet they keep cooperating. Economically, they do not exploit the individually rational strategy of free-riding for most of the game. This implies a cooperative orientation or prosocial preference rather than pure payoff maximization.\n\nOverall, their contribution profile fits a “cooperative but occasionally opportunistic” type: they default to strong cooperation, are robust to some free-riding, but are not entirely immune to short-term temptation as the game unfolds.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThey never send any chat messages and never respond directly to others’ comments, despite sustained attempts by others to coordinate and express appreciation. This indicates a silent, non-engaging communication style: they observe others’ talk but do not participate.\n\nThe lack of verbal coordination, combined with consistently high contribution levels, suggests they treat the game as an individual decision problem rather than as a social negotiation. They allow others to set the cooperative norm in chat but follow or adjust based on observed actions, not on conversation.\n\nTheir silence is not clearly hostile or supportive; it is more neutral/withdrawn. They do not publicly endorse the cooperative norm, do not complain about free-riders, and do not express gratitude when rewarded. This makes them socially opaque to others: they contribute like a strong cooperator but do not signal intentions or emotions verbally.\n\nResponsiveness to others’ communication is unknown in content terms; however, their behavior loosely tracks the group pattern (staying mostly aligned with the high contributors), which suggests they are at least paying attention to outcomes and possibly inferring norms indirectly from others’ talk.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThey are aware of the game horizon, as the interface displays remaining rounds, but they do not show a steady cooperation decay as the end approaches. They continue to contribute at or near full even when very close to the final round, including in the last round itself.\n\nThere is one marked low contribution late in the game, but it does not trigger a sustained shift to defection in subsequent rounds. Instead, they quickly revert to high contributions, including at the end. This pattern does not match a classic end-game unraveling strategy; it is more consistent with a one-off deviation or exploration.\n\nThey do not appear to condition their last-round behavior on reciprocal expectations or “last chance” exploitation. Their final-round choice aligns with their early-game cooperative mode, indicating either a stable internal norm of contribution or low salience of finite-horizon strategic thinking.\n\nIn summary, their strategy is only weakly shaped by end-game incentives; they maintain substantial cooperation rather than exploiting the final period.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey never spend any coins on rewarding others, even when others contribute maximally and express appreciation in chat. This shows a strong reluctance to incur personal costs for positive sanctions in this institutional setting.\n\nGiven the cost-benefit structure of reward (costly and efficiency-reducing from an individual standpoint), their behavior is consistent with self-interested evaluation of the reward mechanism: they are willing to cooperate via contributions but not willing to spend additional resources to reinforce others’ cooperation.\n\nThey receive rewards multiple times but do not reciprocate with reward spending, even toward those who likely rewarded them or consistently contributed highly. This absence of observable rewarding suggests they do not use reward as a strategic tool for alliance-building, reciprocity, or norm enforcement.\n\nThey rely entirely on their own contribution choices to influence outcomes and never attempt to shape others’ behavior via the reward mechanism. Their incentives appear to prioritize preserving their payoff over actively supporting or thanking others financially.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThey are rewarded on several occasions, but their subsequent behavior shows no clear change in contribution pattern that can be directly linked to being rewarded, and they never reward anyone in return. There is no observable direct reciprocity in the use of the reward mechanism.\n\nTheir contributions remain generally high before and after receiving rewards, so it is unclear whether reward has any motivational effect beyond what their baseline cooperative preference already dictates. Any internal feeling of gratitude is behaviorally invisible: they do not respond in chat and do not repay via rewards.\n\nIf they recognize specific rewarders, this recognition does not manifest as targeted behavioral changes (either extra contributions or reward-giving). Their response to being rewarded is thus best characterized as neutral in terms of observable strategy—no retaliation, no alliance formation, no signaling.\n\nOverall, they behave as a cooperative contributor who is largely indifferent, at least behaviorally, to the reward system and does not engage in explicit reciprocal rewarding."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a generally high contributor with one clear deviation. They usually give the full endowment, even when others start defecting, suggesting a baseline cooperative or efficiency-oriented inclination. Their contributions are not mechanically unconditional, however: after making a costly cooperative move that is not reciprocated via reward, they temporarily switch to free-riding. This indicates conditional cooperation influenced by perceived social reciprocity, not just contribution levels. They explicitly reference the payoff logic later, recognizing that defectors can earn more when others continue to contribute, so they understand the strategic incentives and are not simply naïve. Despite this awareness and explicit peer pressure to defect at the end, they continue to contribute fully, implying some combination of fairness concern, mild social anxiety about defecting, and a tendency toward “doing the proper thing” even when others suggest otherwise. Their behavior is somewhat volatile early on (switching once to zero), but then stabilizes to full contributions, showing fast adaptation and then commitment to a cooperative pattern.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThey are active and engaged in chat, with a mix of emotional expression, mild sarcasm, and playful humor. They openly share their frustration when their initial generosity via reward is not reciprocated, using a somewhat dramatic, self-pitying tone that signals hurt feelings and a desire for mutual recognition. They participate in norm-enforcement talk, aligning with others who criticize non-contributors, including a brief call to “get” a perceived free-rider, hinting at a punitive or at least sanctioning attitude despite the absence of formal punishment. They also use humor and light teasing to maintain social rapport, and they engage in meta-commentary on the game (noticing player exits, referencing the game horizon, and joking about other avatars). When facing a coordination dilemma at the end, they explicitly voice “decision paralysis” and attempt to negotiate a side deal (offering to cooperate in exchange for being rewarded), suggesting both social dependence and strategic bargaining. Overall, they are socially engaged, responsive to others’ comments, and comfortable using chat both for coordination and emotional venting.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThey are clearly aware of the finite horizon and explicitly acknowledge when the last round arrives. Unlike the classic end-game defection pattern, they do not shift to non-contribution at the end; instead, they experience genuine internal conflict about whether to defect when others urge everyone to stop contributing. They express this conflict directly and try to resolve it socially by tying their decision to potential rewards. Ultimately, they continue to contribute fully in the final round even though prominent others advocate zero contributions, suggesting that end-game awareness does not fully override their cooperative or norm-following tendencies. Their final-round behavior looks like a mix of conditionality (they seek assurance or reward) and an underlying reluctance to join a collective defection even when it is strategically justifiable.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey exhibit a strong initial willingness to reward, to the point of making a very large and personally costly reward investment early on. This is done before having any evidence of reciprocal rewarding from others, suggesting a hopeful attempt to create or signal a cooperative reward norm rather than a purely reactive strategy. When no one rewards them back, they immediately conclude that rewarding is “pointless” and stop entirely for the rest of the game. From that point on, they never spend on reward again, even when later rewarded by others. This pattern indicates that their reward behavior is driven by expectations of mutual reciprocity and social recognition: once those expectations are violated, they withdraw from the reward system completely. They also later try to use reward strategically as a bargaining chip (“you reward me and I will…”), showing that they treat rewards as a possible tool for contingent cooperation, not just as moral praise.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThey are rewarded by others in at least one round but do not respond with reciprocal reward. There is no evidence of them acknowledging specific rewarders in chat, thanking them, or building an explicit alliance based on rewards. Given their earlier verbalization that rewarding is useless because no one rewarded them back, it appears that once they form this negative belief, they generalize it and ignore subsequent positive signals. Thus, their reciprocity via reward is asymmetric: they are willing to initiate rewarding in hopes of a rewarding norm, but once disappointed, they do not re-engage even when others start to reward them. This implies low propensity to form dyadic, reward-based alliances; instead, they treat the reward environment in a more global, binary way (“worth it” vs “not worth it”), with limited nuance or updating based on individual-level behavior. Emotional acknowledgment of being rewarded is absent or unknown.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey pay attention to who contributes and who does not, and they also track group size and exits. They join in the informal condemnation of low contributors, encouraging others to “get” them and echoing the narrative of certain players being the problem. They comment on the changing composition of the group (noting when someone disappears) and on shifts in contribution patterns, including the rise of free-riding and the resulting payoff advantage for defectors. They explicitly analyze the payoff dynamics, recognizing that those who contribute nothing can get higher payoffs when others continue to contribute, yet they also distinguish between short-run and long-run consequences when discussing the math with others. They adopt a somewhat moralistic, resigned tone toward free-riders (“some people just want to watch the world burn”), blending normative judgment with an understanding of strategic incentives. Overall, they are outcome-aware, sensitive to fairness and reciprocity, and their attitudes toward others are shaped strongly by perceived contribution behavior and the presence or absence of mutual rewarding."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a mixed, somewhat erratic conditional cooperator with occasional free-riding. They are clearly willing to fully cooperate: they repeatedly choose the maximal contribution and continue to do so even after witnessing at least one clear defector gain higher payoffs. At the same time, they also fully defect in some rounds, including when many others defect and when free-riding is especially profitable. Their pattern suggests they are sensitive to group norms and possibly experimenting rather than strictly following a single rule.\n\nThey appear comfortable with risk in the sense of not always aligning with the majority: they fully contribute in situations where many peers call for defection, but also defect in situations with both cooperative and uncooperative behavior around them. There is no evidence that they follow a strict fairness norm such as “match the group average” or “never exploit cooperators”; instead they alternate between being a full cooperator and a free-rider.\n\nOverall, they seem responsive to the broad cooperation climate, but not in a strictly monotone way: they sometimes cooperate when others say not to, and sometimes defect when substantial cooperation is present. Their decisions fit a type that weighs both profit and the social environment but does not lock into a stable rule.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nTheir communication is sparse, reactive, and focused on clarification rather than leadership. They greet others, but they do not initiate strategy proposals about contribution or reward. When another player appears to accuse “monkey” of not contributing, they quickly defend their reputation, clarifying that they did contribute everything. This shows concern about how others perceive their contribution, and a desire not to be misclassified as a defector.\n\nBeyond this, they ask for clarification when they are confused about being addressed, indicating they pay attention to chat and care about understanding social references. They do not engage in moralizing, blaming, or directing others’ strategies, and they never join the more heated or sarcastic exchanges. Their tone is neutral to slightly defensive when their behavior is questioned, but not aggressive. They seem socially attentive yet reserved, preferring to correct misunderstandings rather than steer group norms.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThey clearly have awareness of the game horizon (the number of rounds) from the shared information and chat context, but there is no direct statement from them about the remaining rounds. Behaviorally, they do not follow a simple end-game defection logic. Even when others explicitly push for universal defection at the very end, they still fully contribute in the last round. This suggests that, at least in this setting, they do not adopt a purely backward-induction or “last-round, always defect” strategy.\n\nInstead, they seem willing to maintain or attempt cooperation even in an environment where many explicitly discuss shutting cooperation down at the end. At the same time, they defect in earlier late-stage play, so it is not that they are consistently principled; their last-round full contribution indicates either a residual cooperative inclination, confusion, or a deliberate choice to keep contributing despite the end-game incentives. Their end-game pattern is thus mixed but notably not purely self-serving.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey never spend any coins on rewarding others in any round, despite having multiple opportunities and clear examples of others using the reward mechanism. This holds even when they personally receive a small amount of reward early on. Their revealed preference is that reward is not worth the cost under these parameters, or at least not worth using given how others behave.\n\nThey also never publicly endorse or discuss reward in chat. There is no sign they use reward strategically to encourage cooperation, reciprocate kindness, or punish defectors indirectly by rewarding only cooperators. In terms of type, they act as a non-rewarder: they rely solely on contribution choices rather than secondary mechanisms to influence others.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThey receive a small reward early in the game from another player. After this, there is no observable change in their reward behavior or contributions that clearly reflects gratitude-based reciprocity. They do not start rewarding the rewarder (or anyone) afterward, and they do not comment on the reward in chat. There is no explicit attempt to build an alliance or exchange of favors with the identifiable rewarder.\n\nTheir subsequent contribution pattern (alternating between full contribution and defection) does not obviously track whether they have been rewarded or who rewarded them. This suggests that, at least in this context, they do not strongly condition on having been rewarded, either in terms of reciprocity or increased commitment to cooperation. Their response to reward is best characterized as neutral: they accept the payoff but do not change their strategic toolkit or communication because of it.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey observe all outcome information, including who contributes, who defects, and who spends on reward, but they rarely comment on it. The only clear reaction to outcome-related social information is when they are implicitly accused of not contributing; then they assert that they did contribute fully. This indicates they care about their cooperative image relative to others’ outcomes and do not want to be grouped with defectors.\n\nThey do not publicly criticize or praise players who defect or over-reward, nor do they join in group condemnation of perceived free-riders. They also do not publicly engage with others’ questions about the value of reward. Their behavior suggests a player who monitors the environment, adjusts contributions in a way that loosely tracks the group’s cooperation level, but does so quietly and without overt commentary on others’ payoffs or strategic choices. They appear more concerned with their own payoff and reputation than with norm enforcement or moral judgment of others."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a “stubborn moderate cooperator.” They almost always contribute the same intermediate amount, with only one brief deviation downward and one brief deviation upward. Their default is to give a consistent, non-maximal share that is below what many others give but still far from free-riding. They do not systematically adjust contributions in response to changes in others’ average behavior, even when they are repeatedly the unique low contributor among mostly high contributors, and even when they are singled out by punishment. This suggests they treat their chosen level as a personal fairness norm or comfortable compromise between self-interest and group benefit, rather than using a flexible, conditional cooperation strategy. They show low reactive volatility: feedback from others (via punishment, rewards to others, or shifts in group contributions) does not produce sustained upward or downward trends in their own giving. Their risk tolerance appears moderate: they are willing to undercontribute relative to others despite visibility and sanction risk, but they also avoid extreme free-riding that might trigger harsher responses or collapse group cooperation.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey never use punishment, despite having multiple opportunities and a clear pattern that one specific partner targets them with costly sanctions. This indicates a very high threshold for imposing costs on others and a strong reluctance to spend personal resources for either deterrence or retaliation. Their behavior does not show targeted or proportional sanctions toward lower contributors, nor retaliation against someone who persistently punishes them. From this, it is reasonable to infer that they either (a) view punishment as inefficient or not worth the cost, (b) are conflict-averse and prefer not to escalate, or (c) are focused on maximizing own payoff without engaging in norm enforcement. Because they themselves are consistently under the group’s contribution norm, it is also plausible that they recognize their own vulnerability and avoid a punishment “war”; however, this is uncertain. Overall, they function as a non-enforcer type: they free-ride somewhat on the norm-enforcement efforts of others without joining those efforts.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nWhen another player repeatedly punishes them, they do not retaliate, they do not significantly increase their contribution to align with the punisher’s implicit demand, and they do not shift into a punitive stance toward anyone else. Their contribution pattern remains essentially stable after being sanctioned multiple times, including instances where the sanction is substantial. This indicates that punishment does not successfully coerce them into higher cooperation and does not trigger counter-punishment. They appear to “absorb” the punishment and continue with their own strategy, implying either a strong commitment to their chosen contribution level, indifference to others’ attempts to control their behavior, or uncertainty about how to interpret the sanction. They exhibit behavioral forgiveness or at least non-retaliation: even persistent, costly punishment aimed at them does not change their treatment of the punisher relative to other group members.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey never use rewards, even though several others actively reward high contributors. They do not reciprocate those prosocial signals, and they do not selectively reinforce any partner’s behavior. This suggests that they either place low value on norm-reinforcement via positive incentives, consider the reward mechanism inefficient for their own payoff, or are generally uninterested in actively shaping others’ behavior. The absence of rewarding despite clear evidence that others employ it implies they do not try to join the “prosocial coalition” that uses rewards to sustain high cooperation. Their stance is thus passive with respect to positive incentives: they benefit from a high-contribution environment that others help sustain, but they do not invest in maintaining it.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThey never receive rewards from others in this game, so their direct response to being rewarded is unknown. Because they consistently refrain from using reward on anyone, including players who are frequently rewarding others, it is uncertain whether they would respond with reciprocal reward or higher contributions if they ever were rewarded. There is no behavioral evidence that they attempt to form alliances with rewarders or distinguish rewarders from non-rewarders in their own actions.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey observe a group where several players often contribute close to the maximum and sometimes spend on rewards, while one player regularly devotes substantial resources to punishing them. Despite this, they do not visibly condition their behavior on others’ payoffs, spending, or treatment of them. High contributors’ relatively strong earnings and prosocial signaling do not induce them to match those contribution levels, and the punisher’s lower payoffs (due to punishment costs) do not induce them to exploit that player further or adjust contributions downward. They appear largely indifferent, behaviorally, to whether others are sacrificing for the group (via high contribution or reward) or sacrificing to enforce norms (via punishment). This points to a type that monitors the environment enough to see that cooperation is stable and beneficial, and then “locks in” a personally satisfactory contribution that exploits some of the surplus generated by others’ generosity while avoiding extreme opportunism. Their social style is quiet and self-contained: they neither coordinate with prosocial players nor escalate conflict with punishers, and they maintain their own rule-of-thumb strategy regardless of others’ detailed outcomes."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a highly stable, moderate contributor with a strong internal anchor. They fixate on a single contribution level that sits below typical high cooperators but far above free-riders, and they maintain it with striking consistency across almost the entire game. Their contribution barely reacts to fluctuations in others’ behavior, including periods when many peers contribute very little and periods when peers contribute a lot. This suggests they follow a simple personal rule (e.g., “always put in a certain share”) rather than finely adjusting to the group.\n\nThey appear to care about contributing something meaningful but not maximizing social efficiency. They rarely match the highest contributors and are also not the lowest; they sit in the middle, which indicates a moderate fairness norm: they are not comfortable free-riding, but they also do not feel obliged to fully match the most generous players.\n\nVolatility is extremely low. The one clear upward deviation to a higher contribution late in the game is isolated and not sustained, implying either a brief test, a momentary experiment, or a response to a particularly cooperative group state, but not a full strategy shift. They show no evidence of risk-seeking experiments like extremes of 0 or full contribution as a repeated pattern. Overall, their risk tolerance in contributions is low: they prefer a predictable, rule-based input to the public good.\n\nConditioning on others appears weak at best. When others drop their contributions sharply, this player does not retaliate by reducing their own to very low levels, and when others contribute very highly, they do not significantly increase their own beyond their usual anchor. If any conditionality exists, it is faint and overlaid on a dominant “fixed-rule” tendency. They behave more like a rule-following, mildly prosocial type than a reactive conditional cooperator.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nAwareness of the game’s horizon does not produce a classic end-game unraveling. This player does not progressively reduce contributions as the game approaches the final rounds. Instead, they maintain their usual level almost all the way through, with only a single temporary spike above their norm very near the end and then a quick return to their baseline.\n\nThis pattern suggests that they either do not think in terms of backward induction or do not prioritize it. They do not exploit the final rounds by defecting or sharply lowering contributions. If anything, they show a slight late-game willingness to try a higher contribution in one instance, which is quickly abandoned, implying that any end-game adjustment is weak and unsystematic.\n\nOverall, the end-game has minimal impact on their behavior. They behave as if the same simple rule continues to apply regardless of how many rounds remain. This is consistent with either limited strategic reasoning about the horizon, or a deliberate choice to keep a steady “fair” contribution independent of stage of the game.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThe player never uses the punishment mechanism, despite frequent availability and despite repeated coexistence with clear under-contributors and free-riders. This is robust across cooperative and uncooperative group states. The absence of any punishment even in periods of noticeably low group contributions points to a strong reluctance to spend resources harming others.\n\nThey do not appear to engage in norm enforcement through costly punishment, even though they themselves are not free-riding and thus sometimes bear the cost of others’ low contributions. This suggests they prioritize conserving their own payoff or avoiding interpersonal conflict over enforcing contribution norms. They do not use punishment as a signal, a deterrent, or a retaliatory tool.\n\nTheir non-use of punishment appears unconditional: there are multiple episodes where targets for norm enforcement are clear (consistent zero or very low contributors), yet this player still refrains. This pattern fits a “non-punishing cooperator” profile: willing to contribute moderately and tolerate some unfairness, but unwilling to incur extra cost to discipline others, even when the punishment technology is relatively effective.\n\nMotivationally, this is consistent with either: (a) a purely payoff-maximizing view that punishment is not worth the personal cost, or (b) a prosocial/peace-keeping stance that avoids harming others even when they contribute less. The transcript does not distinguish these motives clearly, so this inference is low confidence.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nThis player is never punished by others in the observed game. Their deduction field remains at zero throughout, and they therefore receive no direct experience of how it feels to be punished or who their punishers are. As a result, there is no behavioral evidence on how they respond when a specific punisher is identifiable.\n\nWe thus cannot observe whether they would react with retaliation, compliance (increased contributions), forgiveness, or indifference. Given their general stability in contribution, and complete non-use of punishment even when provoked by low contributors, a cautious extrapolation is that they are more likely to respond to being punished, if it happened, by either maintaining their rule-based contribution or, at most, making a modest, non-retaliatory adjustment. However, this is speculative and should be treated as low confidence. For practical purposes, their response to punishers is unknown."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a conditional, somewhat volatile contributor who oscillates between full cooperation and full defection rather than settling into a stable pattern. They frequently contribute the entire endowment when they perceive a cooperative or mixed environment, but they also switch to contributing nothing when they feel exploited or when low contributions by others appear prevalent. Their behavior suggests that they value fairness and reciprocity over strict self-interest: they are often willing to contribute fully even when others are not, but this willingness has limits and erodes when free riding seems persistent or when they are personally punished.\n\nThey appear sensitive to relative behavior rather than absolute payoffs. When the group is broadly cooperative, they match that level and maintain or resume high contributions, suggesting an internal norm that “everyone should contribute” and that they should personally uphold that norm when others do too. When cooperation looks uneven—with some clear free riders—this norm weakens and they are more willing to free ride themselves. Their own defecting is not purely opportunistic; it frequently follows being punished or observing substantial non-cooperation, indicating a reaction to perceived unfairness rather than a fixed selfish strategy.\n\nRisk tolerance for unilateral cooperation is moderate. They sometimes continue to fully contribute despite several others giving nothing, indicating a willingness to risk exploitation for the possibility of supporting or restoring cooperation. However, once they are repeatedly targeted by punishment while also seeing non-contributors benefitting, they become more defensive and more willing to defect. They do not appear to chase short-term maximum earnings aggressively; they often accept a lower immediate payoff (due to contributing or punishing) when that aligns with their fairness expectations or with sanctioning free riders. Overall, they behave like a conditional cooperator with a relatively quick emotional or norm-based response to perceived mistreatment.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThis player does not show a strong classic end-game collapse in contribution. In the final segment of the game, they continue to contribute fully in most rounds and end with full cooperation in the very last round. They do not gradually wind down contributions as the end approaches; instead, they maintain or even reassert full contributions, particularly when others also appear cooperative. This suggests that they either do not heavily factor in the finite horizon strategically, or that maintaining fairness and cooperative norms is more salient for them than last-round exploitation.\n\nTheir punishment behavior near the end becomes more intense in some late rounds, indicating increased willingness to pay to enforce norms even with few rounds remaining. This is consistent with a player who seeks to “correct” behavior or express disapproval rather than a player who is optimizing long-run payoff continuation. There is no clear evidence that they treat the last round as a special opportunity to defect; instead, they leave on a cooperative note, consistent with an internal preference for norm-consistent behavior over purely backward-induction reasoning. Overall, they appear horizon-aware in the sense of adapting to patterns that have developed, but they do not strategically exploit the final rounds by slashing contributions.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThis player is a frequent and sometimes heavy user of costly punishment. They are clearly willing to sacrifice their own earnings to reduce others’ payoffs. The timing and context of their punishment choices indicate that norm enforcement against free riders is a central motive. They tend to punish in situations where there are obvious non-contributors alongside cooperators, and they tend not to punish when the group contributes uniformly. This pattern aligns with a “moralistic punisher” type who targets low contributors to sustain or restore fairness.\n\nTheir punishment is not perfectly restrained. There are episodes of substantial punishment expenditure, especially later in the game, suggesting that emotions such as frustration or resentment may amplify their sanctioning. They continue to punish even after experiencing punishment themselves, which implies that they are not primarily using punishment as a tit-for-tat retaliation tool against specific individuals (since punishers are anonymous and cannot be targeted directly). Instead, they appear to direct punishment broadly at visible defectors, accepting that they themselves may also be punished by others. This supports the interpretation that they see punishment as a collective tool to discipline free riding rather than a purely retaliatory device.\n\nSelectivity is moderate. They do not punish in every low-cooperation environment—there are rounds with substantial free riding where they refrain from punishing—so they are not a rigid or mechanical punisher. However, when they do punish, they are willing to commit nontrivial resources, indicating that the perceived severity or persistence of norm violations matters. Deterrence seems to be an intended function: after punishing in contexts with mixed contributions, they often continue or resume cooperating, as if expecting that sanctions will encourage others to contribute. Overall, they present as a conditional cooperator with strong, sometimes costly, norm-enforcing tendencies and relatively high readiness to bear punishment costs to express disapproval of free riding."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a generally high, norm-following contributor who occasionally experiments with defection. Across the game they choose the cooperative option far more often than the selfish one, so their baseline type is “conditional cooperator with principled leanings.” They appear to adopt a simple rule: contribute fully when a substantial core of others also does so, and withhold only sporadically when cooperation levels are low or mixed.\n\nTheir contributions are mostly stable and not strongly volatile. Isolated deviations from full contribution do not cascade into a persistent free-riding strategy; after trying non-contribution, they quickly return to full cooperation even if the group does not uniformly improve. This suggests they value maintaining a cooperative standard more than strictly optimizing against short-run incentives.\n\nThey display a concern for fairness: they keep contributing even when several others free-ride, and they combine this with selective punishment (discussed below). They seem willing to bear personal cost to support a group norm of high contribution, which is consistent with an internalized fairness or reciprocity norm rather than pure payoff maximization.\n\nTheir tolerance for risk is moderate. They continue to contribute fully in an environment where some players regularly give nothing, indicating they are prepared to “risk” being exploited for the possibility of sustaining cooperation. However, the occasional zero contribution shows they are not blindly altruistic; they are willing to test what happens when they themselves free-ride, likely to gauge both income effects and social feedback via punishment.\n\nConditioning on others’ behavior is present but not extreme. When the environment looks strongly cooperative, they reliably cooperate; when it is mixed or deteriorating, they still usually contribute but occasionally defect. They do not engage in rapid tit-for-tat or fine-grained matching; their reactions are coarse and slow, consistent with a player who tracks the general cooperative climate rather than individual histories (which they cannot fully observe here).\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nAwareness of the finite horizon does not produce a sharp unraveling of their cooperation. They continue to contribute fully in late rounds and do not shift into systematic end-game defection. Sporadic non-contribution is not concentrated at the very end, and they finish the final round by fully cooperating despite the absence of future interactions. This pattern suggests either that they discount backward-induction logic, or that they prioritize maintaining a cooperative identity and norm over exploiting the last opportunities for gain.\n\nThere is no clear evidence of escalating contributions at the very end; rather, they maintain the same high-cooperation rule they use through most of the game. Their behavior is consistent with a player who treats each round similarly in terms of moral or normative expectations, with only weak sensitivity to the shrinking horizon.\n\nGiven they are punished when they defect and that this punishment does not lead to a persistent switch to defection, they may interpret late-game conditions as still worth enforcing norms rather than giving up. Their strategy appears horizon-robust: the end-game does not substantially alter their cooperative stance.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThis player is a willing but selective punisher who uses punishment primarily as norm enforcement against clear low contributors rather than for retaliation or random spite. They spend on punishment in several rounds but also forgo it in many others, indicating they are not compulsive punishers. Their use of the institution is measured: they do not try to punish in every period of low cooperation, but when they do, they commit noticeable resources, sometimes at a relatively high personal cost.\n\nThe triggers for punishment are strongly associated with visible free-riding: they punish in contexts where several group members contribute nothing while they contribute fully. They never punish when the group is nearly or fully cooperative. There is no evidence they punish high contributors or engage in antisocial punishment; instead, their pattern aligns with a desire to sanction defectors and support a cooperative norm.\n\nThey themselves are punished when they defect, but there is no clear sign that they respond by targeting those who punished them, because punisher identities are hidden and their subsequent punishment patterns continue to track free-riders rather than any identifiable subset. This points toward a motive of generalized deterrence of low contribution, not focused retaliation.\n\nTheir selectivity varies over time: in some low-cooperation environments they choose not to punish, possibly conserving resources or perceiving that punishment would not be effective. In other low-cooperation environments they escalate punishment intensity, suggesting that when they believe deterrence might work—or when frustration with persistent free-riding peaks—they are willing to incur significant personal cost to discipline defectors.\n\nOverall, they fit the type of a conditional cooperator–norm enforcer: they cooperate by default, accept personal costs to punish obvious free-riders, and aim to sustain a cooperative standard even when the material incentives and end-game logic would support defection. Their use of punishment is instrumental and morally framed (inferred), but the exact beliefs about its effectiveness and about others’ responsiveness remain uncertain (low confidence on their precise beliefs)."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a conditional, mixed-strategy contributor who alternates between full cooperation and full defection rather than sticking to one extreme. They are willing to contribute the entire endowment when they perceive the group as reasonably cooperative, but they also defect repeatedly, especially once it is clear that some others continue to free-ride and that punishment is available and used against them.\n\nTheir pattern suggests they anchor on a fairness norm close to “if most others give, I should give; if some persistently give nothing, I am entitled to keep my own endowment.” They do not appear to be purely profit-maximizing: they sometimes contribute fully in environments where average contributions are modest and where free-riding would clearly yield more money. This implies a non-monetary value on cooperation or on “doing their part” when they think the group deserves it.\n\nAt the same time, they are opportunistic. They periodically defect even in relatively cooperative environments, especially once they have experienced being punished as a low contributor. This indicates they view defection as acceptable when others are already shouldering the cooperative burden and when they feel personally treated unfairly or targeted. Their contribution behavior is volatile: they switch multiple times between full giving and full keeping, which is consistent with ongoing updating and experimentation rather than a fixed rule.\n\nThe player seems moderately risk-tolerant. They freely expose themselves to punishment by defecting despite evidence that low contributions are punished in this group. That suggests either a willingness to gamble that punishers will focus on more blatant free-riders, or a readiness to accept some punishment as a cost of exploiting cooperative periods.\n\nOverall, they fit a “resentful conditional cooperator”: inclined to support cooperation, but quick to withhold contributions when they feel others or the institution are not aligned with their fairness expectations.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThe player is clearly aware of the finite horizon and does not simply drift into full defection near the end. In the final portion of the game, they continue to alternate between defection and full contribution rather than showing a monotonic decay in cooperation. In the very last round, they fully cooperate in a highly cooperative environment and do not use punishment, consistent with a desire to end on a mutually beneficial, high-efficiency outcome rather than to exploit the final opportunity.\n\nTheir end-game behavior suggests that they do not apply a strict backward-induction logic (which would dictate defection and possibly no punishment at the end). Instead, they maintain their conditional fairness rule through to the final round: if the group is strongly cooperative, they match that cooperation even when there is no future to influence. This implies that the act of cooperating itself and the immediate fairness of the outcome matter, beyond strategic future-oriented incentives.\n\nThere is no evidence of escalating retaliation or of “last-round spite.” If anything, the end-game displays a reversion to cooperative norms when others’ behavior justifies it. This indicates that the player values outcome symmetry and group welfare in the moment, and does not prioritize squeezing out maximal private payoff at the very end.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThe player is an active and persistent punisher who spends substantial resources across many rounds. They are clearly willing to incur personal costs to impose even larger costs on others. Punishment use is not random: it is systematically associated with others’ low contributions. Their pattern fits a norm-enforcing role rather than arbitrary aggression.\n\nThey appears to target clear free-riders—those contributing nothing when many others contribute—and they use punishment both when they themselves cooperate and when they defect. This is important: they do not restrict punishment to “moral high ground” situations. Even in rounds where they give nothing, they still pay to sanction others who also give nothing. That behavior is consistent with strong norm enforcement and with a view that defection is acceptable for themselves when they feel wronged but that particularly egregious or repeated free-riding by others still deserves sanctions.\n\nThey also continue punishing even after being punished by others, but there is no direct evidence that they identify or target specific individuals in retaliation, since punishers are anonymous. The observed pattern is more consistent with continued enforcement against low contributors than with personal revenge. However, the fact that they keep defecting and keep punishing while being punished themselves suggests a possible layer of frustration: they may believe their own low contributions are more justified than those of others (for example, as a response to perceived unfairness), and therefore they see others’ low contributions as more blameworthy. Confidence in this interpretation is moderate, as motives cannot be directly observed.\n\nThe player does not appear to use punishment purely instrumentally to maximize their own monetary payoff. They sometimes punish in contexts where it plainly lowers their own income relative to simply tolerating others’ behavior. This is consistent with strong reciprocity or inequality aversion: they are prepared to sacrifice money to reduce perceived unfair advantages enjoyed by free-riders and to push the group toward higher cooperation."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThe player is a “conditional high contributor with intermittent free-riding and sensitivity to norms.” They demonstrate a clear willingness to cooperate: they choose the cooperative option substantially more often than not and repeatedly sustain full contributions even when others do not match them. This suggests they value collective efficiency and are not purely self-interested in the short term.\n\nTheir contributions are conditional, not rigid. They occasionally switch to zero when others’ cooperation looks fragile or uneven. These non-contribution choices cluster after exposure to low contributions or punishment aimed at them, indicating that they condition behavior on perceived fairness and on how they are treated. However, they do not adopt a simple tit-for-tat rule; after free-riding, they readily return to full contribution, even while some peers still contribute little. This points to a flexible, exploratory strategy rather than a strict rule-based one.\n\nThey appear to hold a fairness norm where full or near-full contribution by most players is the reference point. When the group approximates that norm, they reliably cooperate. When contributions are uneven or declining, they tolerate some level of free-riding by others but sometimes temporarily free-ride themselves, likely balancing payoff and frustration. Their willingness to keep contributing in the presence of multiple low contributors suggests a relatively high tolerance for inequality, provided that overall cooperation remains substantial.\n\nRisk tolerance is moderate to high: they contribute fully many times when the strategic environment is uncertain and they have already experienced being punished themselves. They accept the risk of being exploited in order to support or probe for a cooperative standard, instead of defaulting to self-protection. At the same time, their occasional zero contributions indicate they are not a naïve unconditional cooperator; they do protect their own payoff when norms look unstable or when they have just borne unfair costs.\n\nOverall, their contribution pattern is mixed but biased toward cooperation, with adjustments that appear responsive to perceived group norms and personal treatment rather than purely to immediate monetary incentives.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThe player shows clear awareness of the finite horizon and does not exhibit pure end-game unraveling. In late rounds, they continue to make cooperative choices in several instances, including in the final round, even after episodes of being punished and after some periods in which they themselves free-ride. This indicates that they do not strictly follow backward-induction logic that would dictate universal defection near the end.\n\nInstead, they appear to use the late game to either reinforce or test norms one last time. They continue to contribute fully in multiple late rounds despite mixed cooperation from others and despite prior punishment aimed at them when they free-rode. This persistence suggests that they maintain a preference for achieving or maintaining a cooperative outcome up to the end, not just early on.\n\nTheir behavior across the final several rounds alternates between cooperation and free-riding, but they finish the game by cooperating and also spending on punishment in the very last round. This pattern is consistent with a player who remains engaged with norm enforcement and group outcomes until the last opportunity, rather than “cashing out” entirely. It suggests that they derive some utility from upholding a cooperative standard or from sanctioning norm violators, even when there is no future round in which to reap discipline-driven benefits.\n\nThey do not show a strong decay in contributions that monotonically accelerates towards the final round. Instead, their contributions fluctuate but repeatedly rebound. This indicates that their strategy in the end game emphasizes expressing or stabilizing norms more than exploiting the final stage.\n\nOverall, they treat the end game as still meaningful for both contribution and punishment decisions, implying horizon awareness but only partial adoption of standard end-game defection logic.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThe player is an “active but selective norm enforcer.” They are clearly willing to incur personal costs to punish, and they do so in multiple, separated episodes across the game rather than as a one-off reaction. This repeated willingness to spend suggests a stable readiness to use sanctions as a strategic tool, not merely a single burst of emotion.\n\nPunishment behavior appears primarily linked to deviations from a cooperative norm. They tend to punish in periods where some players are contributing less than what looks like the emerging standard of full or near-full contribution. They do not punish continuously whenever any low contribution exists, which indicates selectivity and some thresholding rather than indiscriminate hostility. The selectivity suggests they may target more persistent or salient low contributors, or times when free-riding is especially at odds with the group pattern. The exact targeting is unknown, but their repeated punishment in such contexts is consistent with a desire to deter free-riding and reinforce cooperation.\n\nThey also continue to punish later in the game, including in the final round, which cannot influence future behavior. This willingness to punish when no future benefits are available points to motives beyond instrumental deterrence. It is consistent with expressive or retributive motives: they may value enforcing fairness or “doing justice” even absent strategic payoff. At the same time, earlier punishment episodes, when future rounds remain, can plausibly have a deterrence component. Thus their punishment motives appear mixed: partly strategic, partly norm- or emotion-driven.\n\nTheir punishment is not tightly coupled to being punished themselves. They are punished in several rounds but do not always respond with punishment immediately afterward, and they also punish in rounds where they are not freshly targeted. This weak link between experienced sanctions and subsequent punishment suggests they are not purely retaliatory or spiteful in a personal sense; they seem more focused on contribution patterns than on revenge. However, because punishers are anonymous, they cannot target specific punishers, which limits our ability to infer responses to specific individuals; any interpretation of retaliatory motives remains low confidence.\n\nThey do not appear to combine non-contribution with punishment in a consistent pattern (such as always free-riding while punishing low contributors), which would be characteristic of “selfish punishers.” Instead, they often punish while also contributing fully, a hallmark of “altruistic punishment” types in PGGs. This combination—bearing both contribution and punishment costs—matches a persona that cares about upholding group-beneficial norms even at personal expense.\n\nOverall, they function as a conditional cooperator who is willing to enforce cooperation via costly punishment, with motives that likely blend instrumental norm support with a fairness or reciprocity ethic."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a generally high, but not unconditional, contributor. They regularly give well above the group’s average and are comfortable matching or exceeding the modal cooperation level when others are cooperative. They appear to value maintaining a strong public good and are willing to sacrifice private payoff to do so.\n\nTheir contributions are adaptive rather than fixed. When most others contribute high amounts, they push their own contribution higher, sometimes up to the full endowment, indicating a strong conditional-cooperation tendency: they are more generous when they perceive the group as cooperative and stable. When there is a noticeable emergence of very low contributors, they reduce their own contribution substantially, signaling that they expect at least a minimal norm of participation and are not willing to indefinitely subsidize clear free riders.\n\nThey show some sensitivity to fairness: they do not insist on perfect equality, but they react behaviorally when others’ contributions fall far below the group cluster. This reaction includes both downward adjustment of their own giving and increased punitive activity, suggesting they link fairness norms to both contribution and sanctions. Their willingness to swing their contribution both upward and downward suggests moderate risk tolerance: they are prepared to risk being more generous than necessary when the group looks trustworthy, but they will also risk triggering conflict by cutting back when norms are violated.\n\nOverall, the player fits a “conditional altruist with enforcement”: they like high cooperation, readily invest in it, but make their cooperation contingent on others meeting a baseline standard and on having tools to discipline severe free riding.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThis player is a consistent, low-intensity punisher who targets clear under-contributors and apparent free riders. They are willing to spend on punishment in most rounds, but typically in small, single-unit amounts. This pattern indicates that they see punishment as a tool to enforce norms rather than as a way to maximize immediate material payoff, since the punishment technology is costly and they still choose to bear that cost.\n\nTheir targets are systematically those contributing conspicuously less than the bulk of the group, particularly very low or minimal contributors. When someone’s effort to the public good is far below what the player and most others are doing, the player reliably participates in sanctioning. The player does not appear to punish high or typical contributors, suggesting they are not using punishment opportunistically or for spite; instead, they are discriminating and norm-oriented.\n\nThey are willing to punish even when their own contribution is high and the group outcome is strong, which indicates an enforcement motive rather than pure frustration or retaliation over personal loss. At the same time, when low contributing behavior becomes more widespread or extreme, the player reduces their own contribution and sometimes withholds punishment, hinting at a limit to how much they will invest in “policing” if they feel it will not be effective or reciprocated by others.\n\nTheir use of relatively small punishment units suggests a preference for calibrated, signaling sanctions rather than maximal harm. They seem to aim for deterrence and norm communication—reminding deviators of the expected standard—rather than trying to drive them out or impose disproportionate suffering. There is no evidence of retaliatory punishment in response to being personally punished; after being sanctioned themselves once, they do not launch a visibly harsher or broader punishment campaign. This implies they either do not infer who punished them or deliberately avoid vendettas, staying focused on contribution behavior rather than on payoff shocks.\n\nIn summary, this player acts as a mild, principled enforcer: ready to pay to punish clear free riders, careful not to punish cooperators, and using punishment as a corrective signal more than as revenge.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThis player pays close attention to the pattern of others’ contributions and the resulting payoffs, and they adjust both contribution and punishment accordingly. When they observe a cluster of high contributions leading to high payoffs for almost everyone, they are comfortable sustaining or increasing their own cooperation, even while spending coins on sanctioning a few deviants. The fact that they continue to punish while group welfare is high suggests they prioritize maintaining norms over squeezing out maximum immediate profit.\n\nWhen others’ outcomes reflect extreme free riding—visible in low contributions that nonetheless share in the redistributed pool—they respond by combining two moves: they reduce their own contributions, and they either initiate or maintain targeted punishment toward those low contributors. This shows that they interpret others’ good payoffs (achieved via low contributions) as an unfair gain that justifies costly correction. They do not, however, lash out against everyone; they distinguish between typical contributors whose payoffs are high but norm-consistent, and outliers whose payoffs seem unearned.\n\nAfter receiving punishment themselves once, they do not obviously change strategy in a way that reflects fear of being punished for high or low contributions; instead, their main behavioral inflections track the structure of others’ contributions and apparent norm violations. This suggests they care more about contribution patterns and fairness than about their own short-run payoff volatility.\n\nThey appear to infer that most other players are broadly cooperative but that a subset is willing to free ride if unpunished. Their behavioral response is to support the cooperative majority by staying generous and, at the same time, to participate in disciplining the minority through modest, repeated sanctions. If they see that others are also punishing egregious under-contributors—reflected in heavy deductions to those players—they continue to invest in the norm, likely believing that the enforcement environment is shared rather than solitary.\n\nOverall, the player treats others’ outcomes as signals about the health of the cooperation norm. High, fairly earned payoffs lead them to remain cooperative and gently enforcing; visible gains from free riding trigger lower contributions and focused punishment."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a consistently high contributor with mild responsiveness to the group. They start by giving substantially more than the minimal cooperative norm and then move quickly to full contributions. Across the game they keep their contributions at or near the maximum, with only small downward adjustments. Their giving is not purely mechanical: when group contributions dip, they modestly reduce their own, and when low contributions come from clear outliers, they still remain above the group average. This suggests a conditional cooperator with a strong internal norm to support the public good rather than a strict “mirror” of others’ behavior.\n\nThey do not appear highly risk‑averse about being exploited; they continue to contribute generously even after receiving unexplained punishment and in the presence of repeat low contributors. Efficiency matters to them: the environment has a high marginal per capita return, and their behavior matches someone who recognizes that mutual high contributions are collectively and individually beneficial. They also accept minor personal disadvantage to uphold this cooperative pattern, rather than optimizing narrowly for short‑term payoff. Overall, they fit a “pro‑social conditional cooperator” type with a strong fairness/efficiency norm and moderate tolerance for free‑riding before adjusting downward.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThis player is willing to use costly punishment selectively and in a principled way. They do not punish every round, and they never appear to punish high or average contributors. Their punishment is concentrated on clear low contributors and is applied at a non‑trivial intensity when they act, indicating they care about enforcement rather than symbolic gestures.\n\nTheir pattern fits a norm‑enforcing role: they punish those who contribute far below the informal group standard, particularly when such behavior threatens the cooperative equilibrium. They do not show clear signs of retaliation toward those who might have punished them earlier; punished targets are better explained by low contributions than by any clear link to their own prior deductions. They also refrain from punishing borderline cases, indicating some threshold before they act rather than punishing any deviation. This suggests a “strong conditional cooperator with altruistic punishment”: willing to spend to discipline free‑riders but not inclined to use punishment vindictively or indiscriminately. They appear motivated more by deterrence and fairness maintenance than by short‑term payoff maximization.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThis player observes others’ contributions and net payoffs and updates their behavior in a measured way. When the group largely maintains high contributions and punishment keeps defectors in check, they continue to contribute fully and abstain from further punishment, suggesting satisfaction with the emergent norm. When conspicuous low contributors appear and sanctions against them are either absent or appear insufficient, the player both slightly reduces their own contribution and steps in with targeted punishment, indicating sensitivity to both actions and outcomes.\n\nThey do not escalate or withdraw cooperation in response to personally receiving punishment; their giving remains high and their use of punishment continues to target low contributors rather than suspected punishers. This implies they interpret outcomes primarily through a cooperative‑norm lens rather than through a personal grievance lens. They tolerate some inequality in payoffs when it arises from differences in contribution and sanctioning, but respond when inequality is driven by sustained low contributions benefiting from the group. Overall, they read the outcome structure for signals about the health of cooperation and adjust in ways intended to stabilize a high‑contribution, norm‑compliant environment."

They reliably give the full endowment or very close to it and stay above the group average throughout. When they do reduce their own contribution, the change is incremental rather than abrupt, indicating controlled calibration rather than collapse of cooperation. Their pattern suggests they treat high contribution as the default norm and respond only weakly to the presence of moderate or even substantial under-contributors. They appear tolerant of inequality in contributions as long as the overall group output remains high, prioritizing collective efficiency over strict proportional fairness. Risk tolerance is high: they repeatedly expose themselves to exploitation risk by contributing more than many others, even after receiving some punishment themselves. Overall, they fit a “pro-social conditional cooperator,” but with a strong pro-cooperation bias and only mild sensitivity to others’ deviations.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThe player is an active but restrained punisher who mainly targets conspicuous under-contributors and appears focused on norm enforcement rather than revenge. They are willing to incur nontrivial costs to sanction others in several periods, but they never escalate into heavy or widespread punishment campaigns. Their use of punishment coincides with clear gaps between their own contributions and those of certain low contributors, especially repeated or extreme low contributors, which suggests a fairness or reciprocity motive: they use punishment to discipline free-riding rather than to settle personal scores. When group contributions improve or align more closely, they are willing to withhold punishment entirely. They also do not respond in any obvious tit-for-tat fashion when they themselves are punished; their own experience of being deducted does not translate into broad counter-punishment, which implies they do not interpret punishment as a personal attack so much as a signaling device about norms. Overall, they use punishment in a targeted, low-intensity way to support high cooperation, accepting personal cost but not obsessively maximizing deterrence.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThe player monitors others’ outcomes and adjusts in a measured, non-reactive style. Seeing that many others earn high payoffs despite contributing less, they do not dramatically cut their own effort or stop cooperating; instead they make small contribution adjustments and continue to invest heavily in the public good. This indicates a priority on maintaining group welfare rather than seeking immediate payoff parity. When low contributors suffer sizable deductions, the player does not visibly “pile on” nor relax their own standards; they keep using moderate punishment and high contributions, suggesting they view such outcomes as confirmation that sanctioning low cooperation is acceptable and perhaps shared by others. The fact that they experience some deductions themselves yet maintain high contributions and only modestly change punishment behavior implies they interpret punishment as norm feedback rather than as unjust hostility. In new environments, this type is likely to keep cooperating at a high level, use selective punishment to shape contributions, and accept being occasionally sanctioned or out-earned without abandoning their cooperative strategy, so long as the overall cooperative norm does not collapse."

Contributions cluster around the group average or slightly below it, with occasional full contributions when group cooperation looks strong. The player clearly understands that contributing is socially beneficial, given that they never free-ride aggressively and sometimes give the maximum possible amount. However, they also show willingness to under-contribute relative to high contributors when overall cooperation appears secure, which suggests a concern for personal payoff and a readiness to “coattail” on others’ generosity.\n\nTheir contribution pattern is responsive to the group rather than fixed. When others’ cooperation is high and stable, they are willing to match or exceed the typical contribution. When some group members start contributing very little and total contributions fall, they do not escalate their own giving to compensate; instead, they stay around a moderate level that protects their payoff while still participating in the public good. This indicates conditional cooperation based on observed peer behavior rather than unconditional altruism.\n\nFairness norms appear present but not strict. The player does not insist on exact equality in contributions, tolerating moderate deviations as long as the overall cooperation level remains high. They seem more bothered by very low contributors than by small under-contributions. Risk tolerance is medium: they are willing to risk higher contributions when others appear cooperative, but they do not keep pushing contributions upward when the environment grows more erratic.\n\nOverall, their type is a “pragmatic conditional cooperator”: they value the public good and prefer high-contribution equilibria, but they also guard against being exploited and are comfortable contributing somewhat less than the most generous group members when that seems safe.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThis player is an active, norm-enforcing punisher who primarily targets conspicuously low contributors and appears focused on shaping group behavior rather than retaliating for personal harm. They do not punish every round, and when they do, they spend a meaningful but not extreme amount on punishment. This indicates they are willing to incur real costs to enforce norms, but they are not obsessed with punishment nor are they punishing indiscriminately.\n\nTheir punishment choices are selective: they direct punishment toward players whose contributions are far below the informal group standard, especially when those low contributions stand out amidst generally high cooperation. They do not appear to punish those who are roughly at or above the group mean, even if those players are slightly below the maximum, suggesting they are enforcing a “no blatant free-riding” rule rather than a “everyone must give the maximum” rule.\n\nThe timing of their punishment aligns more with deterrence than with revenge. They are not personally targeted by punishment in a way that would justify strong retaliatory motives, yet they still choose to punish low contributors on some occasions. This behavior is consistent with a desire to correct or deter free-riding for the sake of the group outcome. They also show that punishment decisions can change over time: they sometimes refrain from punishing despite the presence of low contributors, which suggests they may be balancing the marginal benefit of further norm enforcement against the cost to themselves, or inferring that others are already punishing the same targets.\n\nThey do not use punishment to discipline high contributors or to respond spitefully to others’ payoffs; there is no evidence of antisocial punishment. Their pattern fits a “prosocial, efficiency-minded norm enforcer” who uses punishment strategically against clear deviants, not as an expression of hostility or competition.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThis player tracks others’ contributions and the aggregate payoff environment closely and uses that information to adjust both contributions and punishment. When the group’s overall payoff is high and cooperation is strong, they are willing to maintain or even increase their own contribution and sometimes abstain from punishment, effectively free-riding partially on the social order while still supporting it. When they see individuals benefiting from the group while contributing very little, and especially when those individuals still end up with solid payoffs, they become more willing to spend to reduce those players’ earnings.\n\nThey seem more sensitive to contribution behavior than to final payoff levels per se. High earners are not punished if their contributions are also high; low contributors are targeted even if their payoffs are not the very highest. This suggests that what matters to them is whether others have “earned” their payoffs by contributing adequately, not the absolute size of those payoffs.\n\nThe player appears to infer and rely on emergent norms. When many others also spend on punishment and low contributors suffer large total deductions, the player sometimes holds back from adding their own punishment, implying they expect group-level enforcement to suffice. Conversely, when low-contribution behavior looks under-sanctioned relative to its deviation from the norm, they step in and contribute to punishment. This indicates a belief that punishment is a shared responsibility rather than solely theirs.\n\nIn terms of learning, the player adapts gradually: they adjust contributions up or down in response to observed group cooperation and punishment patterns, but they do not show abrupt swings or extreme reactions. As the environment becomes more heterogeneous, with some players contributing very low amounts and others remaining high, they neither collapse into full free-riding nor escalate into constant punishment. This stability suggests a temperament that is measured and pragmatic, valuing cooperation and fairness while continuously weighing personal cost against group-level benefits."
