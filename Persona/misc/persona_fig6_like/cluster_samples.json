        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThe player is a moderately prosocial but self-oriented conditional cooperator with high volatility. They do not anchor on a single contribution level; instead, they frequently shift between very low and very high contributions. They clearly understand that contributing can be profitable when others also contribute, because they repeatedly choose high contributions in environments where group contributions appear strong. At the same time, they are comfortable free-riding and sometimes take the full endowment while still benefiting from others’ cooperation.\n\nTheir contributions track the perceived cooperativeness of the group in a broad, qualitative way: when others as a whole appear generous, the player is generally willing to join in, though rarely as the most altruistic member. When the group seems more mixed or deteriorating, they reduce their own contribution sharply, sometimes down to zero, even if cooperation has not completely collapsed. They do not insist on strict equality or fairness; they tolerate contributing more than many low contributors around them at times, and at other times they themselves are among the least generous while others are still contributing substantially. This suggests weak or flexible fairness norms: they care about payoff-relevant conditions (is it lucrative to contribute now?) more than about matching others exactly.\n\nRisk-wise, the player shows a willingness to “gamble” on high contributions when the environment looks cooperative, accepting the immediate personal sacrifice for the expectation of a good group return. However, they do not sustain high contributions unconditionally. Their pattern indicates a payoff-sensitive, opportunistic stance rather than a principled commitment to cooperation or a strict free-riding strategy.\n\nOverall, they are a payoff-oriented conditional cooperator: willing to support the public good when it seems profitable and somewhat socially supported, but quick to scale back and free-ride when they sense fragility or unevenness in group contributions. Their strategy is adaptive rather than rigid, but also noisy and inconsistent, suggesting that they update heuristically rather than following a clear, stable rule.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThe player appears aware that the game has a finite horizon, but they do not exhibit a simple linear decay or a pure “end-spurt” of defection. In the final portion of the game, they continue to vary their contributions, sometimes contributing very little and sometimes at moderate-to-high levels. They do not switch into a pure defector mode in the last few rounds, nor do they escalate to full cooperation as a final gesture.\n\nInstead, their late-game behavior remains conditional and opportunistic: they adjust contributions up when the group as a whole still looks reasonably cooperative, and they reduce them when the environment seems more mixed or deteriorating, even very close to the final round. This implies that, even when the end is near, their primary reference remains the current cooperative climate and expected payoff, not a strict backward-induction logic or a moral norm about “finishing strong.”\n\nIn short, their end-game strategy continues the same pattern as earlier: flexible conditional cooperation with intermittent free-riding, rather than a clear terminal collapse or a final cooperative surge."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a generally cooperative but strategically flexible contributor who oscillates between full cooperation and full free-riding rather than settling into a single stable pattern. They are willing to contribute fully even when others free-ride, and they repeatedly return to full contributions after periods where cooperation in the group has weakened, indicating that they value group efficiency and are not purely self-maximizing.\n\nTheir contribution pattern is conditional but not in a strict tit-for-tat sense. They sometimes free-ride when overall cooperation appears unstable or when others explicitly question the point of contributing, yet they also continue to contribute fully in some mixed or partially uncooperative environments. This suggests a “weak conditional cooperator”: they are influenced by group behavior and talk, but they do not mechanically match the group average.\n\nThey appear to understand that high collective contributions are beneficial: when others contribute more, they respond positively and are willing to rejoin or sustain high contribution profiles. At the same time, they opportunistically exploit cooperative episodes by withholding their own contribution while benefiting from others’ efforts, showing a non-negligible self-interested streak and comfort with strategic free-riding.\n\nRisk tolerance is moderate. They are willing to risk contributing when others are unreliable, but they also hedge by sometimes choosing zero contributions even when cooperation is possible. Fairness concerns are present but not rigid: they do not visibly protest specific free-riders and occasionally take advantage of generous group behavior themselves, implying a pragmatic rather than moralistic approach to fairness.\n\nOverall, they sit between a pure cooperator and a pure free-rider: generally pro-cooperation, somewhat responsive to the social and strategic context, and prepared to deviate when cooperation seems fragile or “pointless.”\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThe player’s communication style is brief, sociable, and coordination-oriented. They engage in light, informal chat rather than remaining silent, and they direct at least one message toward motivating or cueing a slower or less responsive participant, suggesting a mild leadership or nudging tendency. They frame their prompts in a casual and humorous way rather than confrontationally, which points to a desire to keep the atmosphere friendly while still moving the game along.\n\nThey also respond positively when cooperation improves, using upbeat, inclusive language to reinforce a moment of high group contribution. This indicates they pay attention to shifts in group behavior and try to socially reward better coordination through tone rather than through any available sanction or reward mechanisms (which are absent here).\n\nThey do not explicitly criticize low contributors or threaten defection, and they do not engage in direct strategic persuasion (such as explaining payoffs or proposing binding agreements). Their engagement is low-to-moderate in volume but clearly indicates attentiveness to others’ pace and to the level of cooperation. They are responsive rather than domineering: they align their remarks with the unfolding chat and group state, suggesting a socially attuned but non-intrusive style.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nAwareness of the finite horizon does not lead this player to a clear, monotonic end-game defection pattern. In later rounds, they continue to alternate between full contributions and free-riding rather than moving decisively toward zero contributions as the game approaches its conclusion. They still contribute fully in the very last stage, indicating that they do not rigidly follow the standard backward-induction logic of full defection at the end.\n\nTheir later-round behavior remains contingent on perceived group cooperation and on the surrounding tone (“no point” type sentiments from others correlate with some of their defection choices), rather than directly on the countdown of remaining rounds. The horizon appears to be psychologically backgrounded: they know the game length from the interface, but their strategy continues to be driven more by current group behavior and chat signals than by time remaining.\n\nOverall, this player maintains a mixed, context-sensitive strategy through the end of the game. They neither escalate cooperation in a “last push” nor fully abandon it in classic end-game fashion, which suggests that in new PGG environments they are likely to carry their conditional, socially influenced contribution style all the way to the final rounds instead of sharply changing behavior simply because the game is ending."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThe player is a moderately cooperative, payoff-conscious conditional cooperator who toggles between free-riding, partial contribution, and full contribution. They do not adopt a fixed strategy; instead, they adjust contributions in response to the perceived cooperativeness of the group and to their own payoff experiences.\n\nTheir modal choice is an intermediate contribution rather than extremes. They frequently pick a mid-level amount instead of always giving nothing or everything, suggesting they balance self-interest with sustaining group returns. They occasionally fully free-ride, particularly when others are already contributing heavily and group cooperation appears robust, which indicates exploitation of favorable group behavior rather than principled unconditional cooperation. They also periodically contribute their entire endowment when the group appears highly cooperative or when total cooperation seems to surge, consistent with conditional cooperation and a desire to maintain or join high-contribution states.\n\nThe pattern shows responsiveness rather than randomness: when cooperation in the group looks strong, they are more willing to contribute high or full amounts; when they observe more low contributors or erratic behavior, they revert to safer mid-level contributions or even zero. This indicates a belief that their own contribution both benefits from and should track what others do, and that over-contributing when others are less cooperative is not worthwhile.\n\nThey appear payoff-aware. They experience high payoffs both when they free-ride amid generous others and when they join a highly cooperative group with substantial contributions. They then stay within a band of contributions that maintains good returns without systematically sacrificing personal earnings. This suggests they understand, at least behaviorally, that the marginal per-coin return from the public fund is attractive, but that exploiting others’ generosity occasionally is individually profitable.\n\nThere is no evidence of strong fairness enforcement or willingness to “lead” by consistently contributing high regardless of others. Instead, they seem comfortable benefiting from others’ generosity at times and do not consistently match the highest contributors. Their willingness to vacillate between zero, intermediate, and full contributions suggests moderate risk tolerance: they are willing to deviate from whatever the majority seems to do, but not in a purely selfish or purely altruistic direction. They are not rigidly inequality-averse; they accept scenarios where they gain more than heavy contributors and do not subsequently compensate by over-contributing.\n\nOverall, their persona is that of a flexible, opportunistic conditional cooperator: they prefer cooperative, high-contribution environments and will support them with nontrivial or full contributions, but they also strategically exploit such environments by occasional free-riding or dialing down their own contribution when they judge group cooperation to be sufficiently high or fragile.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nAwareness of the finite horizon does not produce a pronounced end-game collapse in cooperation for this player. In the final segment of the game, they continue using the same basic repertoire—mostly intermediate contributions with occasional higher ones—rather than sharply dropping to persistent free-riding once the end is near. There is no clear shift to a purely self-regarding, zero-contribution strategy in the final rounds.\n\nTheir behavior instead suggests a stable heuristic: maintain moderate contributions in most periods and adjust upward or downward slightly in response to how cooperative the group seems, independent of proximity to the final round. Near the end, they still invest nontrivially in the public fund, implying that they either do not strategically backward-induct or do not prioritize extracting maximal end-game private payoff at the expense of cooperation.\n\nAny subtle changes are small relative to their established pattern. They do not escalate to reliably maximal contributions as a “last gift,” nor do they systematically unwind cooperation. This indicates that while they know how many rounds remain (as per game rules), that knowledge does not dominate their decision-making. They continue to treat late rounds similarly to mid-game, with the same opportunistic yet partially cooperative stance. Their end-game type is therefore “horizon-aware but not horizon-driven”: they may understand the game is ending, but they do not radically change strategy in response."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player fits a “high but strategic cooperator” type. Across the game, they tend to contribute well above the group average, often close to the maximum, but they do not lock into blind full cooperation. Instead, they adjust around a high baseline in response to perceived changes in others’ behavior and the group’s contribution level.\n\nThey initially experiment with low and medium contributions before quickly moving into a pattern of strong cooperation. Once they see that many peers are regularly giving substantial amounts, they typically match or slightly exceed the prevailing cooperative norm. They are willing to give the full endowment in many rounds and frequently choose contributions in the upper range, indicating strong pro-social inclination combined with acceptance of the individual cost.\n\nTheir contributions are not perfectly stable: they occasionally drop to moderate or even zero contributions. These drops coincide with situations where the group’s contributions are more uneven or where some players free-ride more visibly. This suggests conditional cooperation: they are willing to sustain high giving while others also contribute reasonably, but they temporarily reduce their own contribution when they infer that the environment is drifting toward lower cooperation. However, these lower-contribution episodes are short-lived; they typically revert quickly to high contributions if group cooperation recovers, indicating they prioritize restoring a cooperative equilibrium over retaliatory defection.\n\nThey display sensitivity to fairness at the group level. When others are broadly contributing high amounts, they appear comfortable matching that level, and they do not systematically undercut the group. The few low-contribution choices seem more like tests or responses to perceived unfairness than a consistent desire to exploit others.\n\nTheir risk tolerance is moderate to high. Given that personal returns from contribution depend on others, they repeatedly accept short-term risk in order to support a high-contribution environment, even after episodes where such generosity yields relatively lower payoffs due to weaker group contributions. They do not show systematic payoff maximization via free-riding; instead, they trade off some individual security for the prospect of higher group payoffs, consistent with a cooperative but strategically aware profile.\n\nOverall, this player is best characterized as a conditional high cooperator: generally generous, responsive to the group’s cooperative climate, and willing to bear individual cost to support high-contribution equilibria, but not fully unconditional.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nAwareness of the finite horizon does not trigger a collapse of cooperation for this player. In the late game, including the final rounds, they continue to contribute at high or upper-mid levels rather than shifting into systematic free-riding. There is some fluctuation and a slight tendency to lower from full-max contributions to strong but not maximal amounts, but there is no clear end-game defection wave.\n\nThis pattern suggests that they either do not heavily apply backward-induction reasoning or they place substantial weight on cooperative norms and consistency over final-round exploitation. They appear more inclined to “finish cooperatively” than to exploit the final opportunity for personal gain.\n\nTheir late-game behavior remains conditional: when the group maintains robust contributions, they sustain high giving; when group contributions are more mixed, they adjust slightly downward but still stay cooperative. The final round continues this rule-based pattern rather than exhibiting a unique, one-off deviation.\n\nIn short, their end-game strategy is to keep cooperating at a high level with moderate fine-tuning rather than to abandon cooperation, indicating a stable pro-cooperative orientation that persists even when no future rounds remain."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThe player is a flexible, payoff-conscious conditional cooperator with intermittent free-riding. They do not commit to a single stable contribution level; instead, they alternate between zero, moderate, and high contributions. Their choices track the overall cooperativeness of the group: they are more willing to contribute when others appear highly cooperative and when the public fund remains strong, and they reduce or drop contributions when they see lower or unstable group contributions.\n\nThey clearly recognize the private incentive to free-ride: they repeatedly take the option to contribute nothing while benefiting from substantial group contributions. However, they are not a pure defector; they regularly choose non-minimal contributions, sometimes relatively high ones. This mix suggests they balance personal earnings with some willingness to support group efficiency, rather than following a strict selfish or altruistic rule.\n\nTheir contribution pattern is volatile rather than fixed. They move between low and high contributions multiple times, indicating ongoing adjustment rather than a simple early decision. This volatility appears responsive to perceived norms: in phases when many others seem generous, they frequently join in with sizeable contributions; when there is visible heterogeneity or some apparent free-riding by others, they sometimes switch back to low or zero contributions.\n\nThey display a weak but present fairness or reciprocity norm. They never systematically match the most cooperative players, but they do seem uncomfortable being purely exploitative for the entire game: after episodes of low giving, they later choose to contribute generously even when they could keep all coins and still benefit from others’ giving. This suggests a limited internal standard of “doing their share,” though that standard is inconsistent.\n\nRisk tolerance appears moderate. The player is willing to “invest” in the public fund in situations where they cannot predict exact future behavior of others but where recent evidence suggests a cooperative environment. At the same time, they often hedge by choosing mid-level contributions rather than always going to the maximum, signaling some caution about overexposure if others defect.\n\nOverall, the player is best described as a strategically adaptive, opportunistic cooperator: they exploit cooperative environments at times but also help sustain them once they trust that others are reliably contributing. Their cooperativeness is conditional, fluctuating with their assessment of the group’s behavior and their own payoff experience.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThe player is clearly aware of the finite horizon and does not follow a simple “cooperate to the end” rule. In the last several rounds, their contributions remain variable rather than monotonically declining or increasing. They sometimes contribute substantial amounts close to the end, but they also intersperse zero contributions, including in the final round.\n\nThere is no consistent pattern of escalating generosity or systematic end-game defection. Instead, their late-game behavior looks like a continuation of their earlier conditional style: they respond to the current cooperative climate more than to the abstract fact that the game is ending. When others remain relatively cooperative late in the game, the player is still willing to contribute non-trivially in some of those rounds, despite having no future rounds in which reputation or reciprocation can pay off. At the same time, they seize opportunities to free-ride near the end, including at the very last possible decision.\n\nThis combination suggests that horizon awareness is present but not dominant. The player does not appear to run a backward-induction strategy; instead, they treat late rounds largely like earlier ones, with slightly more readiness to defect opportunistically when the payoff from free-riding is salient. Their cooperation does not collapse entirely as the end approaches, but it becomes more selective and interspersed with full defection, consistent with an adaptive type that weighs immediate payoff opportunities more heavily than long-run relational concerns once the horizon is short."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is best described as a *calculating opportunistic free-rider with occasional exploratory cooperation*. Their default tendency is to give nothing to the public fund even when others are fully cooperative, and they maintain this stance for most of the game. Contributions are generally low and infrequent, with two notable deviations where they give a substantial amount. This pattern suggests they primarily prioritize personal payoff over efficiency or equality, only temporarily deviating from that to test or experience more cooperative outcomes.\n\nTheir behavior is highly conditional on others’ actions in a narrow, self-focused way: they appear to take others’ unwavering full contributions as an exploitable resource rather than as a norm to reciprocate. However, the fact that they do sometimes make large contributions indicates they are not a pure, rigid free-rider. Instead, they seem capable of experimenting with higher contributions, perhaps to see the payoff consequences or to gauge how the mechanism works, but they do not sustain such behavior.\n\nThere is no indication that they are aiming at fairness in the sense of matching others’ contributions or equalizing payoffs. They consistently benefit from others’ generosity without reciprocating in a stable way. This suggests a weak or absent internal fairness norm within the game context, at least behaviorally. If any fairness concern exists, it does not override their inclination to exploit the cooperative environment.\n\nTheir risk tolerance appears moderate to low: once they see that others contribute maximally and that they can safely free-ride, they largely stick to the safe, high-private-payoff strategy, with only a couple of higher-contribution deviations that look more exploratory than risk-seeking for social reasons. They do not appear to fear retaliation or breakdown of cooperation, possibly because no punishment is available and others’ behavior remains perfectly stable.\n\nOverall, their contribution pattern is stable in its free-riding core but punctuated by a small number of sizable, short-lived cooperative moves, which look like tests or curiosity-driven changes rather than commitment to a cooperative norm.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThe player shows awareness of the game horizon but does not use it to gradually reduce cooperation; instead, they maintain a predominantly free-riding strategy throughout and briefly escalate cooperation before returning to free-riding at the very end. There is no classic pattern of declining contributions as the end approaches, because sustained cooperation is never really established from their side.\n\nIn the late phase, they temporarily switch to high contributions and then abruptly revert to giving nothing on the final decision. This suggests that, when the end is clearly in sight, they still prioritize their own last-round payoff over any desire to maintain a cooperative pattern. The final move is consistent with end-game defection logic: with no future interaction, they feel no incentive to continue contributing.\n\nTheir brief late-game cooperative surge does not translate into a “cooperation ramp” or a stable end-game strategy. Instead, it looks like a short experiment that they quickly abandon when it directly conflicts with maximizing their final payoff. There is no behavioral sign that they are motivated to leave a “good impression” or end on a prosocial note; the terminal choice is self-serving and aligns with their broader opportunistic type."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a calculated, profit-oriented “selective free-rider” who flexibly switches between full contribution and full defection, with no middle levels available. They do not settle into a stable cooperative or non-cooperative identity; instead, they alternate contributions in a way that keeps their own earnings relatively high while relying heavily on others’ sustained cooperation.\n\nThey consistently exploit cooperative environments: when the group’s average contribution remains high, they frequently choose not to contribute and thereby secure strictly higher payoffs than most contributors. Their contribution decisions show no clear matching or fairness norm (e.g., they do not “reward” others’ high contributions by reliably joining them, nor do they visibly punish low contributors by withdrawing support). Rather than aiming for equality of payoffs, they appear comfortable being among the highest earners at others’ expense.\n\nTheir pattern suggests low concern for outcome fairness and relatively low guilt or discomfort about free-riding. At the same time, they do sometimes contribute even when free-riding would be immediately more profitable, indicating either: (a) some concern for maintaining the group’s cooperative level over time, or (b) experimentation and mild strategic uncertainty. The alternation of contributions, rather than a monotone decline or rise, is consistent with opportunistic adjustment to a setting where others prove reliably generous.\n\nRisk tolerance appears moderate: they are willing to contribute in an environment where others occasionally defect, but they do not persist in cooperative behavior when it is clearly unnecessary for them to profit. With a very high multiplier and consistently high group contributions, they know that even if they defect, they still gain large returns from the public pool. Their main orientation is toward maximizing own payoff under that favorable background, not toward sustaining cooperation at personal cost.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThis player shows horizon awareness but does not exhibit a classic end-game collapse into universal defection. In the late game, they continue to mix between contributing and not contributing rather than simply free-riding to the finish. There is no sharp shift toward lower contributions as the final round approaches, which suggests that their strategy is not driven by a simple “cooperate early, defect late” heuristic.\n\nInstead, they maintain the same basic opportunistic pattern they display earlier: sometimes contributing when the group is already cooperative, sometimes defecting to capture extra gains. They do not try to “cash out” by switching exclusively to free-riding at the end, nor do they “make up for” earlier free-riding by ending on a more prosocial note in a way that sacrifices clear monetary advantage. Their end-game behavior is consistent with a player who already believes they have extracted value effectively throughout the game and simply continues their existing rule rather than re-optimizing specifically for the final rounds.\n\nOverall, end-game awareness is present (they know how many rounds remain), but there is no strong evidence of either end-game altruism or a last-round defection spike. The end period looks like a continuation of an already opportunistic approach rather than a qualitatively new phase.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThis player observes others’ contributions and payoffs each round and appears to learn that the group is persistently cooperative. Once this is clear, they repeatedly choose actions that exploit that cooperativeness: they free-ride in many situations where others are almost unanimously contributing, obtaining higher payoffs than almost all peers. This indicates that they respond to others’ outcomes by taking advantage of the predictability and generosity of the environment, rather than by reciprocating.\n\nThey do not show clear conditional cooperation in the classic sense: they do not reliably increase their own contributions when others are generous, nor do they cut back when they see a few defectors still earning high payoffs. Their willingness to continue contributing in a highly cooperative but exploitable group suggests that their primary response to others’ outcomes is not emotional (e.g., anger at free-riders) but instrumental: they contribute or not depending on whether they see a personal advantage or at least no clear disadvantage in maintaining a cooperative baseline.\n\nBecause there is no punishment or reward mechanism in this environment, we see no direct evidence of how they would spend resources to change others’ payoffs. However, from their comfortable free-riding on high contributors, the most plausible extrapolation is that they do not prioritize sanctioning or rewarding behavior in general; they treat others’ payoffs mainly as background conditions that create opportunities for themselves. Empathy for those who earn less, or resentment toward those who defect, is not evident from their choices; their behavior stays focused on their own earnings, relatively insensitive to whether specific peers are slightly advantaged or disadvantaged in a given round."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a mixed, strategically opportunistic cooperator with a bias toward free-riding when the group is reliably cooperative. They alternate between full contribution and full defection rather than using intermediate or noisy patterns, indicating a clear, discrete strategy choice instead of random fluctuation. Early on, they are willing to contribute fully even when some others free-ride, suggesting they accept short-term disadvantage to help maintain a high group return. As the game progresses and it becomes clear that the group sustains high contributions without sanction mechanisms, they increasingly exploit this by withholding their own contribution while continuing to benefit from others’ cooperation. Their choices show awareness of the payoff structure: they contribute in many rounds but regularly insert defection rounds to boost personal payoffs, especially once group behavior appears stable and predictable. They do not appear to adhere to strict equality or reciprocity norms; they tolerate receiving more than consistent cooperators and do not visibly “correct” that by over-contributing later. Overall, they prioritize personal earnings while still contributing often enough to support the public good, resembling a calculated conditional cooperator who leans toward self-interest rather than a pure altruist or pure free-rider. Risk attitude is moderately cautious: they seldom defect in ways that would obviously destabilize the group, instead free-riding opportunistically while others keep contributions high.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThe player is clearly horizon-aware and adjusts behavior near the end. They do not follow a simple “end-game collapse” script where they stop contributing as the final rounds approach. Instead, their late-game behavior is non-monotonic: they defect in some late rounds but also return to full contribution, including in the final round. This suggests they track remaining rounds yet do not purely backward-induct to universal defection. Their willingness to contribute at the very end, even after having successfully free-ridden in other late rounds, indicates that they do not operate on a strict “last chance to exploit” mindset. Possible motives (uncertain) include maintaining a cooperative self-image, avoiding being the most obvious exploiter, or simply following a mixed strategy they see as balanced. There is no evidence of escalating selfishness right at the horizon; instead, their pattern remains one of alternating exploitation and cooperation, with end-game effects present but not dominant.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThe player is sensitive to the general cooperation level and to how others’ actions affect payoffs, but the response is aggregate rather than individually targeted. They see that many peers contribute consistently and receive slightly lower payoffs than defectors, yet they are willing to occupy the higher-payoff, lower-contribution niche without any compensating behavior. This implies a relatively low concern for strict payoff fairness and a comfort with benefiting more than those who contribute as much or more to the public good. At the same time, they do not push their exploitation to an extreme; they continue contributing frequently, which helps sustain high group outcomes. The absence of punishment and reward in this environment means we cannot observe any direct response to others’ outcomes via sanctions or bonuses; their adaptation happens only through their own contribution choices. When group contributions remain strong despite some defections, they respond by inserting more free-riding rounds, indicating they track that cooperators are “absorbing” the cost without collapsing. Conversely, when cooperation levels are very high, they are also willing to fully contribute, suggesting they value the high common return and may feel some obligation or strategic need to maintain it. Overall, they appear attuned to the payoff consequences of others’ actions but prioritize exploiting favorable group behavior over enforcing norms or equalizing outcomes."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a mostly conditional cooperator with opportunistic free-riding. After beginning as a pure defector, they shift into a pattern where they often match or exceed the group’s cooperative baseline but intermittently exploit cooperative periods by keeping their endowment. Contribution choices are binary and used flexibly rather than rigidly; they neither lock into always-give nor always-keep. They seem sensitive to whether “enough” others are contributing and are more willing to contribute when the broader environment is cooperative and somewhat stable. When others’ behavior becomes erratic or more selfish, they do not respond with a clear, consistent retaliation rule; instead, they sometimes keep contributing and other times free-ride, suggesting low but present concern for fairness and a stronger focus on personal payoff than on strict reciprocity.\n\nTheir strategy suggests they understand that contributing in a cooperative environment can be individually profitable, yet they are comfortable deviating to defection even when others are largely cooperative. They exhibit moderate risk tolerance: they are willing to contribute when others seem likely to cooperate, but they also periodically “test” how much they can gain by deviating. The pattern indicates they value both group efficiency and personal advantage, with the balance tilting toward self-interest when a one-shot gain is available and no punishment is present. Stability is medium: they show phases of sustained cooperation punctuated by isolated defections rather than random noise. They do not show strong commitment to equality of outcomes; they are willing to earn more than others when free-riding on their contributions.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThe player does not send any chat messages. Their style is purely observational and non-verbal. They receive multiple social signals from others, including impatience, humor, and mild attempts to coordinate faster or more cooperative play, yet they never respond directly. This suggests a low-engagement or avoidant communication style: they do not use messages to persuade, negotiate, justify their actions, or enforce norms.\n\nDespite the silence, their behavior adjusts after periods when group members express a desire for coordination and higher contributions, implying that they register social cues but choose not to participate overtly. They appear to treat chat primarily as background information about group mood and likely behavior, not as a channel they themselves want to use. This muted presence can make them harder to read and holds down any social accountability that might come from promising or explaining their strategy. Overall, they are a quiet, reactive observer rather than an active conversational leader.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nAwareness of the finite horizon does not produce a simple monotonic end-game collapse in cooperation. In the late part of the game, the player alternates between cooperation and defection rather than clearly ramping down contributions. They do exploit some late opportunities to free-ride when others continue to cooperate, showing that they are willing to cash in on the absence of future repercussions. At the same time, they also continue to contribute in other late rounds, including the final one, even when a purely self-interested, backward-induction logic would predict consistent defection.\n\nThis pattern suggests that they understand the temptation to defect near the end and act on it intermittently, but they do not adhere to a strict end-game defection rule. Their behavior is better described as opportunistic than fully time-consistent: they look for profitable deviations but still maintain significant cooperative behavior up to and including the last round. The absence of punishment or reward mechanisms appears to make them comfortable taking advantage of cooperative others in select late rounds, but it does not completely erase their willingness to contribute. Their horizon sensitivity is thus present but moderate, producing fluctuating rather than steadily declining cooperation near the end."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThe player is a moderately cooperative, payoff-sensitive conditional cooperator with sizeable free-riding tendencies. Their typical contribution sits in the mid range rather than at the extremes: they neither consistently exploit others by always giving nothing nor commit to strong unconditional cooperation. Contributions vary with the apparent cooperativeness of the group: when others appear to contribute more on average, they are willing to increase their own giving into the mid-to-high range; when others appear to contribute little, they pull back sharply or even drop to zero. This pattern indicates conditional cooperation anchored more on relative than absolute fairness: they seem comfortable contributing less than the highest contributors while still participating in the public good. They display clear responsiveness to payoffs—they sometimes experiment with higher contributions, but when these trials produce visibly lower payoffs for them relative to low-contribution rounds, they reduce later contributions. Their risk tolerance for being a “sucker” is limited; they rarely position themselves at the top of the contribution distribution for the group and often remain at or below the group mean. Over time, they maintain cooperation at a moderate level rather than escalating it, suggesting a preference for balancing earnings with some degree of group-oriented behavior.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThe player is aware of the finite horizon and exhibits a mild but clear end-game effect. In the middle and later stages, when cooperation in the group looks relatively strong, they are willing to contribute at or above their own typical mid-level, signaling that they do not immediately unravel cooperation as the final rounds approach. However, their final-round decision shows a decisive shift toward self-interest, with a contribution that is lower than their established mid-range tendency despite the presence of many cooperative peers. This indicates that, while they are willing to sustain cooperation close to the end when it seems profitable and socially supported, they ultimately prioritize maximizing their final payoff once there is no future interaction. The decay is not gradual and systematic from the midpoint onward; rather, it appears as a late-stage strategic drop that reflects horizon awareness and a willingness to free-ride when future repercussions are absent. Overall, they are an end-game defector who cooperates conditionally up to very near the end, then opportunistically withdraws contribution in the last opportunity."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is primarily a high, almost unconditional cooperator who occasionally experiments with defection. For the overwhelming majority of the game, they contribute the maximum possible amount regardless of whether others do the same. Their cooperation is only weakly conditional: when some group members free‑ride repeatedly, the player still continues to contribute fully most of the time instead of matching or undercutting them. They do, however, test defection a couple of times after a long run of full cooperation, indicating they are not a pure altruist; they are willing to see what happens when they keep their endowment, even after having helped maintain a cooperative norm.\n\nTheir fairness norm is pro‑group but relaxed. They clearly prefer full-contribution outcomes and express appreciation when a previous low contributor starts contributing. At the same time, they are tolerant of deviations and do not push others aggressively toward the norm. When they defect once in an otherwise cooperative environment and are heavily punished, they immediately revert to full contributions and largely stay there, suggesting they are sensitive to social feedback and willing to “fall back in line” when norm enforcement is strong.\n\nRisk tolerance appears moderate. They are willing to risk being a consistent cooperator even when some others are not, accepting lower immediate payoffs for the chance of sustaining high group returns. Their two zero‑contribution choices look like controlled probes rather than a wholesale strategy shift: they do not cascade into continued free‑riding, nor do they signal a desire to dismantle cooperation entirely. There is no evidence of systematic payoff optimization; behavior is more consistent with a cooperative default plus occasional opportunistic or exploratory non‑cooperation.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThe player’s tone is relaxed, mildly humorous, and de‑escalating. When another player becomes critical of non‑contributors, they respond by downplaying the seriousness of the situation and framing it as “just a game,” signaling low appetite for social conflict and moralizing. They do not join in blaming or shaming talk, even when they might be justified in doing so as a consistent contributor.\n\nThey engage selectively rather than constantly. When they do speak, it is purposeful: once to cool down tension, once to clarify payoff information, and once to express gratitude toward a previously uncooperative member who starts contributing. This shows responsiveness to both emotional and informational aspects of the interaction, but they do not try to lead or organize the group.\n\nPersuasion style is soft and indirect. They neither instruct others what to do nor threaten them. Instead, they acknowledge others’ efforts and ask neutral questions about the reward structure. Their engagement style is cooperative and affiliative but not highly invested; they care about good outcomes and smooth interaction, yet they also keep a bit of emotional distance, emphasizing that the stakes are limited.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThere is little evidence of a classic “end-game collapse” pattern. The player’s contribution profile near the end stays mostly aligned with their general cooperative tendency. They do not make a clear, strategic shift to sustained free‑riding in the final rounds despite knowing the horizon length, nor do they ramp up contributions uniquely at the very end.\n\nTheir occasional switch to non‑contribution occurs in the later middle of the game, but it is brief and reversed quickly. After testing defection and encountering strong punishment, they largely return to full contributions, including in the last stretch. This suggests that horizon awareness does not dominate their behavior; they appear more anchored in ongoing group norms and recent social feedback than in backward induction logic. Any end‑game awareness influence is weak or unknown.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey never use the punishment mechanism in any round, even when doing so could credibly enforce cooperation or retaliate for heavy sanctions against them. This indicates a strong reluctance to spend personal resources to harm others, even in cases of clear free‑riding or personal grievance.\n\nTheir threshold for punishing appears extremely high or absent. They experience a severe deduction after a single defection yet do not retaliate against any identifiable partner. Nor do they use sanctions earlier to discipline chronic under‑contributors, despite repeated opportunities and a group norm that openly supports penalizing non‑contributors. This pattern points to a non‑punitive, low‑aggression type: they accept that others may misbehave or punish them without actively engaging in retribution or norm enforcement.\n\nMotivationally, they lean toward “live and let live” rather than either prosocial punishment (to protect the group) or antisocial punishment (to punish cooperators). They seem to rely on persuasion, tolerance, and their own cooperative example rather than formal sanctions to shape behavior. Any latent deterrence motives are unknown or not expressed.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nWhen they defect once after a long record of cooperation and then receive a very large punishment, their behavioral response is compliant and conciliatory rather than hostile. They do not reduce contributions in anger; instead, they immediately return to full contributions in the next cooperative opportunity and maintain that behavior in subsequent rounds. This suggests that they interpret punishment as a strong social signal to re‑adhere to the norm, and they comply without overt protest.\n\nThey show no evidence of retaliating against punishers, despite punishers being identifiable and the deduction being harsh enough to plausibly provoke revenge in many players. They also do not confront anyone verbally about the punishment. This implies a forgiving or at least resignation‑oriented stance toward being sanctioned. They update their play rather than their willingness to attack others.\n\nAt the same time, they do not explicitly apologize or self‑justify in chat; their response is behavioral rather than verbal. Their core pattern is: accept the social cost, restore cooperative behavior, and avoid escalation. Their stance toward the punishing individuals themselves remains behaviorally cooperative and non‑aggressive, consistent with a conflict‑averse, norm‑sensitive cooperator type."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player fits a “conditional cooperative norm enforcer” type with some experimentation. They start by fully cooperating and maintain high contributions even when others contribute less, suggesting an internal norm favoring full provision rather than immediate payoff maximization. Their behavior shows conditionality over time: persistent free-riding by others coexists with their own contributions for a while, but they do test defecting themselves at least once. This defection appears temporary and strategic rather than a full shift to free-riding, as they later return to full contribution when group cooperation becomes strong again.\n\nThey do not appear purely payoff-maximizing, since they repeatedly choose the individually dominated cooperative action under a low marginal per capita return, and they pay additional costs to punish. They tolerate short-term personal losses to promote norm compliance. Fairness seems oriented around equal contributions: those who systematically give nothing while they give fully are treated as violators that justify costly action. Risk tolerance is moderate: they are willing to keep contributing even when others defect and when punishment could provoke counter-punishment (which happens once), but they do not double down aggressively after being targeted; instead, they revert to cooperation when the group converges on full contributions. Volatility is low to moderate: most of their choices follow a clear cooperative pattern with just one notable deviation into defection, suggesting learning and adjustment rather than erratic behavior.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nUnknown. There is no chat content in the transcript, so their tone, persuasion attempts, and responsiveness in communication are unobservable. It is therefore unknown whether they attempt to coordinate via messages, express norms verbally, or remain silent. Engagement/avoidance style in chat is also unknown.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThe player is clearly willing to use costly punishment and does so early and more than once. Their punishment is not indiscriminate: it appears focused on players who contribute less than they do, especially on those who consistently contribute nothing while the punisher contributes fully. This pattern is consistent with a strong inequity-aversion or norm-enforcement motive rather than spite or random aggression.\n\nThey accept substantial personal cost to reduce others’ payoffs, indicating they value enforcing contribution norms enough to sacrifice their own earnings. The punishment is not merely symbolic; they allocate enough units to impose large deductions on low contributors, in line with a deterrence motive. At the same time, they do not appear to escalate after being punished themselves; once they are personally targeted, they stop spending on punishment and shift their focus to contribution decisions. That suggests they are not primarily motivated by retaliation; when they suffer a deduction, they do not respond with counter-punishment against suspected culprits, despite having the option.\n\nOverall, their punishment use is selective, targeted at clear free-riders, and front-loaded rather than persistent. As group cooperation improves, they cease punishing entirely, which is consistent with a conditional strategy: punish to correct deviations, stop punishing when norms are followed.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey attend to others’ outcomes indirectly through adjustments in both contributions and punishment. When others who contribute nothing still receive relatively high payoffs, this player responds by imposing costly deductions on those low contributors, indicating sensitivity to perceived unjust gains. They react more strongly when someone both contributes less and ends up with higher or comparable payoffs than cooperators, which suggests concern with relative payoffs and fairness rather than only absolute efficiency.\n\nWhen others who contribute fully are also punished by someone else, this player does not step in with compensatory behavior or counter-punishment; they neither “protect” high contributors nor lash out at whoever might have punished them. This implies that while they care about punishing low contributors, they either do not infer, or do not act on, second-order norms about unfair punishment of cooperators.\n\nAfter they themselves are punished once for defecting, they immediately re-align with full contributors in the next interaction and refrain from further punishment. This is consistent with being responsive to norm-enforcing signals: when their own deviation leads to a negative outcome, they update by restoring cooperative behavior rather than retaliating. When the group converges on universal high contribution and similar payoffs for everyone, they seem satisfied and no longer adjust via punishment or strategic defection, suggesting that equal, mutually cooperative outcomes meet their goals."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a very high, near-unconditional cooperator. They repeatedly give their full endowment to the public pool in almost every round, only briefly experimenting with a modest reduction once. Their baseline seems to be: “always contribute the maximum” rather than “match the group” or “respond to free-riding.” They keep contributing fully even when others contribute low amounts and even when some players visibly exploit rewards or fluctuate in cooperation. This suggests a strong internal norm favoring contribution that is largely independent of short-term payoffs or others’ behavior. They appear tolerant of free-riding and do not visibly retaliate by lowering their own contribution in response to low contributors. Their one partial contribution indicates some capacity to adjust, but because they immediately return to maximal giving, it looks more like a brief probe or noise than a sustained strategy change. They accept payoff variance and personal cost as the price of maintaining a cooperative stance, implying relatively low risk aversion regarding being exploited and a willingness to prioritize group efficiency over individual earnings.\n\n<REWARD>\nThis player uses rewards intermittently and sparingly, with small, discrete expenditures rather than large, aggressive reward campaigns. They do reward in multiple rounds, so they are not purely selfish or completely indifferent to the incentive mechanism, but they never expend extreme amounts of coins as some others do. Their spending pattern suggests they aim to encourage or acknowledge cooperative behavior, yet they are also guarded: they do not systematically reward all high contributors, and they sometimes choose not to reward at all even when cooperation is high. This points to selective, possibly experimental reinforcement rather than a clear, stable rule like “always reward full contributors.” They appear aware that rewards can shape behavior but do not fully commit to using the mechanism as a main tool, perhaps because they weigh its cost carefully or are uncertain how others will respond. When they do reward, the amounts are modest relative to what is technically possible, which indicates moderate willingness to incur costs for social reinforcement but not at the expense of their entire payoff. Their reward behavior does not clearly track gratitude toward those who reward them, nor obvious reciprocity cycles; any such reciprocity, if present, is low-confidence and not strongly reliable from the transcript.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThis player observes a wide range of others’ outcomes, including extreme over-rewarding, under-rewarding, and varied contribution profiles, yet they maintain a steady cooperative contribution and only moderate, sporadic reward use. They do not appear to be strongly reactive to others’ payoffs or spending decisions: they do not escalate rewards to match others’ generosity, nor do they reduce contributions or withdraw rewards in response to apparent exploitation or erratic behavior. This suggests they either (a) discount others’ short-term payoff choices as noise, (b) treat their own cooperative norm as more important than fine-tuning to others’ actions, or (c) are unsure how to interpret the complex reward patterns and therefore stick to a simple, robust rule of high contribution with minimal adjustment. They show no clear pattern of targeting players who earn very high or very low payoffs; their reaction to others’ extreme reward spending is muted, with no visible shift toward either punishing by withholding cooperation or counterbalancing with their own rewards. Overall, they come across as a principled, somewhat stoic cooperator who notices outcomes but does not heavily condition their behavior on them, preferring consistency and group-beneficial play over outcome-based retaliation or intricate strategic adaptation."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a generally high contributor with conditional tendencies and some volatility. They start by fully cooperating and repeatedly return to full contribution. At one point they noticeably reduce their contribution despite ongoing group appeals for maximum giving, suggesting sensitivity to perceived unfairness or free-riding and a willingness to protect their own payoff when cooperation appears unstable. Later they lower their contribution again in the midgame, even as others are pushing for full contributions, reinforcing that their cooperation is not unconditional. Toward the end, they revert to consistently high contributions and maintain them through the final rounds, indicating that they value the public good when they believe others will also contribute, and they do not exploit the end of the game to free-ride. Overall, they appear to follow a conditional cooperation rule: they are willing to give a lot when they expect others to do the same, but they scale back somewhat when they see repeated under-contribution. They show moderate risk tolerance, willing to invest fully even when some group members are uncooperative, but not so trusting as to keep contributing at the maximum after repeated evidence of persistent free-riders.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nUnknown; this player does not send any chat messages in the transcript. As a result, their tone, explicit persuasion attempts, and responsiveness in dialogue are unobservable. Their engagement style via communication is therefore unknown. Any beliefs or strategies must be inferred solely from contribution and punishment behavior.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThey appear aware of the horizon, as later-round coordination talk in the group explicitly references the last round and threats of heavy punishment for low contributors, and their own behavior aligns with a “finish strong” cooperative stance rather than an endgame defection. In the final part of the game, they maintain full contributions even when some others continue to give nothing, and they do not exploit the final round to reduce their contribution for personal gain. Their punishment behavior does not escalate in the very last round; they use strong punishment earlier and then cease punishing later, even when coordination talk suggests continued sanctioning of low contributors. This pattern suggests that, by the end, they prioritize securing stable, high returns through cooperation rather than pursuing additional retaliation or deterrence, and they do not display the classic late-game collapse of cooperation.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey demonstrate a willingness to punish, including an episode of extremely heavy, costly punishment directed at low contributors. For multiple earlier rounds they refrain from punishing at all, even when free-riding is present and others are already using punishment. This indicates that punishment is not their default: they initially tolerate some deviation or rely on others’ sanctions. Later, they engage in moderate-cost punishment and then in one round impose very large total punishment at high personal cost, targeting clear under-contributors who repeatedly give nothing or very little. This heavy punishment strongly harms their own payoff, suggesting a willingness to sacrifice substantial income to sanction perceived unfairness and repeated free-riding, more consistent with norm-enforcement motives than with pure payoff maximization. They never appear to punish high contributors or engage in “antisocial” punishment; their targets are consistently those contributing much less than the cooperative norm. After this intense sanctioning episode, they return to using no punishment even when non-contributors persist, which may indicate that they see their earlier punishment as a one-time corrective attempt, or that they learn the marginal effectiveness is low and choose to conserve payoff. Overall, they are a conditional, fairness-driven punisher who escalates sharply when patience runs out, focuses punishment on chronic low contributors, and does not use punishment for retaliation against those who punish them (they themselves are never deducted) or for opportunistic reasons.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey observe others’ outcomes without overtly reacting in chat, so their explicit emotional or verbal responses are unknown. Behaviorally, they tolerate initial punishment patterns by others without joining in, suggesting they are not immediately influenced by others’ sanctioning costs or outcomes. When low contributors repeatedly avoid strong punishment or continue to earn relatively high payoffs despite free-riding, they eventually intervene with heavy punishment, implying that they track the mismatch between contribution effort and resulting payoffs. They appear especially triggered when some players both contribute nothing and have not been adequately deterred by prior sanctions, prompting them to spend a large share of their own payoff to reduce those players’ earnings. Later, even after coordination messages encourage everyone to punish under-contributors, they abstain from further sanctions despite ongoing free-riding and despite others still imposing deductions. This suggests that their response to others’ outcomes is not purely imitative; instead, they selectively step in when they judge free-riders’ net outcomes as intolerably high relative to contributors, and then revert to payoff-focused restraint once they have expressed that norm-enforcing response or once the cost-benefit of further punishment appears low. Their sensitivity centers on fairness in final payoffs rather than on copying others’ punishment intensity."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a high, near-unconditional contributor for most of the game. They usually give the full endowment and appear to treat full contribution as the “default” cooperative norm, even when others’ average contributions fluctuate and sometimes fall well below their own. Their behavior suggests they value sustaining group cooperation and are willing to accept personal payoff risk to do so. \n\nThey do not perfectly follow a “simple conditional cooperator” pattern; they continue contributing fully through periods when average contributions drop and when some group members repeatedly free-ride. However, they are not completely rigid. Mid- and late-game, they introduce a few lower contributions, including one sharp reduction, which indicates some sensitivity to the emerging norm and to the diminishing horizon. These deviations are limited and do not escalate into systematic defection; instead, they look like occasional payoff-protecting moves rather than a full abandonment of cooperation.\n\nOverall, they hold a strong fairness/cooperation norm, tolerate substantial exploitation for many rounds, and only modestly adjust downward when group contributions and the end-game timing make full cooperation less attractive.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThe player is clearly aware of the finite horizon and allows it to influence contribution decisions, but only in a restrained way. Near the end, they reduce contributions in some rounds while still maintaining at least moderate giving and even returning to full contribution in the penultimate round. In the final round, they contribute minimally, consistent with standard end-game defection logic. \n\nThis pattern suggests they balance two motives: maximizing final earnings and maintaining a cooperative identity. They do not “unravel” cooperation early; instead, they hold high contributions until late and then selectively defect at the very end, when future reciprocity is impossible. The presence of occasional earlier reductions indicates that they also react to accumulating evidence of others’ opportunism and to decaying overall cooperation, but they do not drive that decay.\n\n<REWARD>\nThe player never pays to reward anyone, despite having repeated opportunities and clearly observable cooperative peers. This is stable across early, middle, and late rounds. Their restraint is not driven by lack of cooperative partners: several group members contribute highly and are actively rewarding others, yet the player still refrains from spending.\n\nGiven that each reward unit is payoff-neutral by design, their refusal to reward indicates a strong cost-avoidance or frugality norm regarding “extra” prosocial expenditures, rather than a misunderstanding of the mechanism. They appear to treat contribution as their main cooperative lever and are unwilling to incur additional direct costs, even to support high contributors or to solidify alliances.\n\nThey therefore exhibit a “cooperative but non-rewarding” type: they provide the public good generously but do not invest in formal positive reciprocity mechanisms.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThe player receives rewards in many rounds, often from consistent high-contribution rewarders, but they never reciprocate with reward. There is no evidence of targeted payback to those who reward them, nor of strategic alliance-building via mutual reward exchange. Their contributions remain high regardless of who rewarded them, indicating that they do not condition their giving on being personally recognized or favored.\n\nThis pattern points to weak or absent gratitude signaling through the available reward channel. If gratitude or appreciation exists, it does not translate into costly reciprocation. Instead, they maintain a largely one-dimensional cooperative strategy: contribute a lot, ignore the reward system as an active tool, and continue cooperating independently of whether specific others treat them well. This is consistent with a principled or norm-based cooperator who is behaviorally stubborn and not very relationally strategic.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThe player observes wide variation in others’ contributions, reward spending, and payoffs. They see some players spend heavily on rewards, some systematically reward high contributors, and others free-ride or sharply reduce contributions. Despite this, they show minimal behavioral reactivity in either direction. High reward expenditures by peers do not inspire them to start rewarding, and persistent low contributions by certain members only gradually and mildly reduce their own contributions, mostly later in the game.\n\nThey also witness others burning considerable payoff on rewarding, sometimes inefficiently, yet they do not imitate this pattern. This suggests they infer that such spending is not necessary for their own objectives. They appear payoff-conscious with respect to side-payments: they let others bear the extra cost of “policing” or reinforcing cooperation while they stick to contribution decisions alone.\n\nTaken together, the player seems to interpret others’ outcomes and choices mainly as a loose signal about the group’s cooperative climate—adjusting contributions slightly when overall cooperation erodes and the end approaches—but does not engage in fine-grained, actor-specific responses. Their type is that of a robust, norm-driven high contributor who is strategically cautious about additional costs, relatively indifferent to the social signaling and alliance benefits of rewards, and only modestly adaptive to others’ evolving behavior."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a high, near-steadfast contributor. They routinely give the maximum possible amount and only rarely drop to a moderate level. The default stance is: “I put a lot into the pot,” even when others contribute much less on average. They do not clearly condition their own giving on the exact pattern of others’ contributions; brief reductions in their contribution level do not systematically align with any clear cooperative collapse or with particular individuals’ behavior, and they quickly return to full contributions afterward. There is no evidence that they try to fine-tune contributions to reward specific high contributors or punish low contributors through their own giving. They appear willing to accept unfavorable payoff comparisons rather than scale back giving to protect themselves from free-riding. This suggests a strong, internally anchored cooperation norm and a tolerance for exploitation. They do not appear to strategically exploit late-game opportunities to free-ride and instead maintain very high contributions even when the number of remaining rounds is minimal.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nAwareness of the game horizon does not noticeably change their strategy: they continue to contribute heavily in late rounds, including the final one, and never shift into a clear end-game defection pattern. There is no late decrease in contributions that would indicate backward induction or “last-round grabbing.” Their approach to rewards (none throughout) also does not change as the end approaches. This suggests that they either do not place much weight on strategic end-game optimization, or they prioritize maintaining a consistent cooperative identity over exploiting final-round opportunities. They treat the end of the game as largely irrelevant for their own behavioral norms.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey never spend any coins on rewarding others, despite having repeated opportunities and being surrounded by players who frequently use the reward mechanism, sometimes at considerable personal cost. This is a stable, persistent choice. Given their high contributions, this pattern is not consistent with pure selfishness focused on maximizing private payoffs through minimal cooperation; instead, it points specifically to an aversion to engaging with the reward instrument. Likely interpretations (each with low to moderate confidence): they may see peer-to-peer rewarding as unnecessary, ineffective, or too costly relative to its benefits; they may dislike taking on an explicitly “judging” or “allocating” role; or they may prefer that cooperation remain unconditional and not transactional. In any case, they do not use rewards to shape others’ behavior, build alliances, or reciprocate. They effectively free-ride on the presence of rewarders while refusing to become one themselves.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThey receive reward from others multiple times, including persistent transfers from certain players who seem to recognize their high contributions. Despite this, they never reciprocate via the reward channel, even toward those who consistently give to them. There is no visible tit-for-tat or alliance-building: they behave the same way toward those who reward them and those who do not. This suggests that they do not treat received rewards as a signal that must be answered in kind. Their gratitude, if present, does not manifest in monetary reciprocity. They may treat rewards as a bonus that does not alter their own cooperative policy, or they may simply disregard the individual-level patterns of who gives them what. Their behavior is compatible with a “principled cooperator who ignores side-payments” rather than a reciprocity-driven strategist.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey consistently see that others are spending heavily on rewards, sometimes at substantial personal cost, and that low contributors often earn high payoffs relative to them. Nonetheless, they do not adjust their contributions downward in a sustained way, nor do they begin rewarding (either to support high contributors or to reinforce rewarders’ costly prosociality). They also do not attempt to mirror others’ reward spending patterns. This indicates that they are relatively insensitive to inequities in realized payoffs and to the strategic use of the reward tool by others. They tolerate being out-earned and do not retaliate or compensate via behavioral change. They also appear unmoved by the fact that some players incur major losses through over-rewarding; there is no observable protective or supportive response, nor any attempt to exploit such players with calculated behavior. Overall, they focus on maintaining their own high-contribution standard and largely ignore the detailed distribution of others’ payoffs, costs, and side payments.\n\nType label (summary, for use in other contexts):  \nA steadfast, norm-driven high contributor who largely ignores peer reward systems and end-game incentives, cooperates almost unconditionally, and shows little inclination toward reciprocity or strategic adaptation based on others’ outcomes."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player fits a “hyper-cooperative but erratic reciprocator with occasional free-riding” profile. They are generally willing to contribute fully to the public good and appear to treat full contribution as their default choice. Across the game, they alternate between full cooperation and full defection rather than using intermediate or mixed patterns, suggesting a simple, binary heuristic rather than fine-tuned optimization.\n\nTheir cooperation is not unconditional. They sometimes free-ride even when most others contribute fully, showing that they do not rigidly follow a fairness or equality norm. They appear comfortable benefiting from others’ contributions without always matching them, especially after periods of intense rewarding, which indicates some sensitivity to their own payoff or fatigue with bearing multiple costs at once.\n\nAt the same time, they repeatedly return to full contribution after free-riding episodes, even when the group includes some consistent non-contributors. This tendency indicates a strong underlying cooperative inclination and relatively high tolerance for being exploited. They are not strongly deterrable by the presence of defectors; they seem oriented toward sustaining group cooperation rather than strictly protecting themselves.\n\nTheir behavior suggests limited conditionality: they do not finely track who is cooperative versus not, and they do not sharply reduce contributions in direct proportion to defection. Instead, they seem to use coarse adjustments: periods of sustained full cooperation, occasional switches to full free-riding, then reversion to cooperation. This pattern is consistent with a player who values cooperation and the public good but is also somewhat impulsive or experimental, occasionally testing free-riding or taking payoff relief after high-cost rewarding episodes.\n\nRisk-wise, they exhibit a moderate willingness to accept potential exploitation: they often contribute fully in groups with visible defectors and without any punishment mechanism, implying that they either expect enough others to cooperate to make contribution attractive or that they intrinsically prefer the cooperative action even under uncertainty. However, free-riding intervals show they are not purely idealistic; they are aware of and sometimes act on the individual incentive to keep their endowment.\n\nOverall, they are a high-cooperation, somewhat volatile contributor who oscillates between pro-social commitment and opportunistic relief, but without a strong, precise contingent strategy.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThe player shows no clear evidence of classic end-game defection. They continue to employ full contributions through the final stretch of the game and do not shift into a systematic “last-round” free-riding mode. In the final rounds, they remain willing to contribute fully even when others are not all cooperating, suggesting that horizon effects do not strongly undermine their cooperative tendency.\n\nThere is some fluctuation near the end, but it does not follow a simple “cooperation collapses as the end approaches” pattern. Instead, they mix both contributing and free-riding late in the game while still returning to full cooperation in the very last round. This indicates that they either do not rely on backward-induction style reasoning, do not prioritize it, or prioritize other motives such as maintaining a cooperative identity or reinforcing norms independently of future payoffs.\n\nThey appear aware that the game has a finite horizon (the interface reveals remaining rounds), but their actions imply that this awareness does not dominate their behavior. Rather than conserving resources or exploiting the final stage, they remain willing to incur cooperative costs at the end. This is consistent with a type who values cooperation as a default stance and is less driven by strictly forward-looking payoff maximization as the game concludes.\n\n<REWARD>\nThis player is an extremely heavy and sometimes extreme user of the reward mechanism. They are clearly willing to spend substantial personal resources to provide rewards to peers, even at the cost of very low or negative round payoffs. This behavior signals strong pro-social or norm-enforcement motives that can override short-term self-interest.\n\nTheir rewarding is broadly directed toward cooperators rather than defectors. They do not appear to systematically reward non-contributors; instead, they seem to reward those who contribute to the public good, attempting to reinforce and encourage cooperative behavior. The amounts they spend on rewards vary widely: in some rounds they give nothing, while in others they invest heavily. This variation suggests a reactive or emotional component—when they perceive cooperative patterns they particularly like, they may respond with bursts of generous rewarding.\n\nThey do not appear to use rewards in a narrowly strategic, profit-maximizing way. Given the reward technology, modest levels of rewarding could already provide positive externalities at reasonable cost, but the player sometimes overshoots, spending far more than is necessary to send a cooperative signal or secure a marginal gain. This behavior is consistent with a “pro-social enthusiast” or “over-committed rewarder” type, who prioritizes supporting cooperators and promoting group welfare over their own monetary outcomes.\n\nThe player also appears somewhat responsive to receiving rewards themselves: after rounds in which they are rewarded, they frequently maintain or resume full cooperation and sometimes also engage in more rewarding. This pattern suggests that they internalize reward as affirmation and may participate in a cycle of mutual reinforcement—cooperation plus reward leading to more cooperation and more reward. However, because they also reward heavily even when their own payoff is harmed, their rewarding is not purely reciprocal; it is partially unconditional and driven by a desire to foster a cooperative environment in general.\n\nIn summary, they are a strong and at times excessive positive reciprocator: they use rewards primarily as a tool to support and encourage cooperative behavior, are willing to incur large personal costs to do so, and do not finely optimize the deployment of rewards for personal gain."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a highly cooperative, near-unconditional full contributor. They overwhelmingly choose to contribute their entire endowment rather than free-ride, with only a single observed deviation where they keep their endowment. That lone deviation does not launch a new pattern; they immediately revert to full contributions thereafter. This suggests their primary “default” is to cooperate rather than to exploit.\n\nTheir behavior shows only weak conditionality: contributions remain high whether the group’s average is slightly lower or higher, and whether some peers free-ride or not. They do not visibly track or mirror specific peers; instead they appear to anchor on a personal norm of contributing fully to the public good. This implies a fairness or efficiency norm that values maximizing group returns even when others are uneven contributors.\n\nThey accept the strategic risk that others might exploit their generosity. The payoff structure makes free-riding individually attractive, yet they rarely do so, which indicates a willingness to sacrifice some personal security for cooperative outcomes. The isolated non-contribution can be interpreted as a brief test of the payoffs or a momentary experiment, not as evidence of a shift to self-interest, since it is not repeated.\n\nOverall, this player fits a “principled cooperator with high tolerance for imperfect group behavior”: they keep contributing even when some free-riding is visible, and they do not seem to react strongly to minor fluctuations in group cooperation.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThere is no pronounced end-game collapse in their cooperation. They maintain full contributions through the final rounds instead of switching to systematic free-riding as the horizon approaches. The single non-contribution occurs in the late game but is immediately followed by a return to full cooperation; thus it does not function as a classic “last-period” defection pattern.\n\nThis suggests that they either (a) do not rely on backward induction to justify defecting near the end, (b) deliberately reject end-game logic in favor of a stable cooperative identity, or (c) attend more to their own norm than to the finite horizon. The fact that they fully cooperate in the very last round indicates that horizon awareness does not dominate their behavior; if they are aware of the remaining rounds, they still choose to act as a cooperator rather than to exploit the lack of future consequences.\n\nThe end-game pattern therefore points to a type who is norm-driven or habit-driven rather than purely outcome-driven. They do not strategically unwind their cooperation even when, from a narrow monetary standpoint, that would be individually optimal.\n\n<REWARD>\nThis player never spends resources on rewarding others, despite having many opportunities and often sitting in cooperative groups where reward could further reinforce prosocial behavior. At the same time, they repeatedly receive reward units from others, sometimes in substantial amounts. They accept these benefits but do not reciprocate through the mechanism provided.\n\nFrom this pattern, it appears they separate cooperation from social reinforcement: they are willing to incur the cost of contributing to the public good itself but are unwilling to incur the additional cost of meta-cooperation via reward. They might see direct contribution as the “proper” channel for helping the group and view reward as unnecessary, inefficient, or strategically opaque—especially given that rewarders and recipients are anonymous and they cannot target specific individuals based on behavior.\n\nTheir lack of rewarding does not change even when they are the target of generous rewards, suggesting that gratitude, if present, does not translate into costly reciprocal reward-giving. They also do not use the reward mechanism as a tool to shape others’ contributions; there is no observed attempt at strategic reinforcement. Overall, they are a pure contributor rather than a “social enforcer”: they invest in the public good itself but abstain from second-order cooperation via rewards."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a steadfast, unconditional cooperator. They always contribute their full endowment and never deviate, regardless of how much others give or how cooperation fluctuates in the group. Their contribution pattern is extremely stable and shows no evidence of conditionality on others’ behavior; they do not reduce their own giving even when free-riding is present or when overall group contributions drop. They appear to follow a strong internal norm that “one should contribute,” rather than responding to short-term payoff incentives, which would favor keeping the endowment. This suggests a high valuation of group efficiency and public-good provision, along with either low sensitivity to exploitation or a willingness to tolerate it. They accept the risk of being the consistent contributor in a mixed group, prioritizing the social optimum over personal earnings. Fairness, in their behavior, is not enforced by matching others but by persistently doing what they treat as the cooperative baseline, independent of what others do.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nAwareness of the finite horizon does not reduce their cooperation; they maintain full contributions until the very last round, with no sign of end-game decay. Instead of “unraveling” as the end approaches, they continue to behave as they have all game. If anything, they become more active with the reward tool toward the end, suggesting that they think about the closing rounds as opportunities to reinforce or recognize cooperation rather than to exploit others. There is no observable shift toward self-serving behavior in the final rounds. This indicates that they either do not reason in a backward-induction, payoff-maximizing way, or they deliberately reject that logic in favor of consistent cooperative principles. Their horizon awareness seems to increase their use of social tools (reward) rather than change their core contribution strategy.\n\n<REWARD>\nThis player is an active, sometimes heavy, rewarder who uses reward as a cooperative reinforcement tool rather than as a precise, efficiency-focused investment. They repeatedly spend substantial portions of their available payoff on rewarding others, including in situations where group cooperation is already high and where the personal cost of rewarding is significant. Their willingness to pay for others to benefit is strong and persists even when the direct financial return from doing so is uncertain or low. They do not appear to use reward in a tightly calibrated, strategic way aimed at maximizing their own future earnings; instead, their pattern fits a prosocial or norm-enforcing style, aiming to support or encourage contributors. They do not systematically withhold reward when others free-ride, but the available data do not reveal how they target specific players, so the exact trigger rules and recipient selection are unknown. Late in the game, they are willing to increase reward spending rather than conserve resources, implying that they treat reward as an expression of cooperative commitment or appreciation rather than a long-run investment tool. Overall, they behave like a principled cooperator who is prepared to incur personal costs to sustain or recognize contributions by others."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is generally a high contributor who initially follows a cooperative, all-in strategy. They are willing to contribute fully even when others do not match their level, at least for several periods. Their behavior indicates a baseline norm that full contribution is the “right” or expected action. However, they are not unconditionally altruistic: when free-riding persists and the environment looks unfavorable, they temporarily switch to free-riding themselves, then revert to full cooperation once others are also fully contributing. This pattern suggests conditional cooperation with some threshold of tolerance for unfairness. They appear to track relative behavior (who is repeatedly free-riding vs. who is consistent) and adjust their own cooperation in response to the overall contribution profile rather than to marginal changes. Risk tolerance regarding cooperation is moderate: they are willing to risk losing payoff by contributing fully for several rounds despite visible defectors, but they eventually protect their own payoff when others do not reciprocate. Overall, they fit a “principled but pragmatic conditional cooperator” type.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nNo explicit chat is shown, so communication style is unknown. There is no evidence of written persuasion, coordination attempts, or emotional expression. Their only observable “communication” is via actions: consistent early full contributions and targeted punishment against specific others. These choices implicitly signal expectations of cooperation and disapproval of free-riding, but any verbal tone or responsiveness in chat is unknown.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThis player is clearly willing to use costly punishment and does so multiple times. Their targets are selectively chosen and not random: they focus on peers whose contribution behavior is uncooperative or disproportionately advantageous relative to others. They seem to use punishment as a norm-enforcement and deterrence tool rather than for blind retaliation, since there is no evidence they are themselves punished yet they still punish others. They are also sensitive to efficiency: they do not punish when everyone is cooperating, and they do not escalate punishment indefinitely. Once cooperation is restored across the group, they completely halt punishment, implying they see it as a conditional intervention rather than a default behavior. Their punishment severity is moderate: they are willing to incur nontrivial personal cost but not to an extreme degree, consistent with a “calibrated enforcer” rather than a spiteful type.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThe player attends to others’ contribution levels and payoff patterns and reacts systematically. When others gain more by free-riding or by contributing less than the cooperative standard, the player responds with punishment that reduces those players’ payoffs and narrows payoff disparities. When peers contribute fully and earn similar payoffs, the player neither punishes nor deviates from cooperation, indicating satisfaction with equitable, high-cooperation outcomes. They are not observed rewarding others, but in this environment reward is unavailable, so their positive reinforcement style is unknown. Their temporary move to free-riding appears linked to observing persistent defectors and payoff advantages for them, suggesting sensitivity to perceived exploitation and a willingness to protect their own payoff if normative tools (punishment plus own cooperation) are not yet producing the desired group behavior. Once others’ outcomes align with a fair, fully cooperative profile, the player aligns fully with that pattern and refrains from any further sanctioning."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a steadfast unconditional cooperator. They consistently allocate their entire endowment to the public fund in every situation, regardless of others’ behavior or the recent payoff environment. Their contribution pattern is extremely stable and shows no strategic adjustment to free‑riding, partial cooperation, or shifts in group norms. They uphold a strong fairness norm that “everyone should put everything in” and treat this as the obvious or correct rule, explicitly advocating this norm in group communication and never deviating from it themselves.\n\nThey appear insensitive to short‑term individual payoff maximization: they continue full cooperation even when others repeatedly under‑contribute and when returns from the public fund are relatively low. There is no observable risk‑hedging or conditional cooperation; they do not experiment with lower contributions to test others, nor do they reduce contributions in response to persistent defectors. Their behavior is consistent with a principled or norm‑driven type rather than an outcome‑driven or strategic type. Whether this stems from intrinsic pro‑social preferences, a desire to be “the good player,” or misunderstanding of the payoff structure is unknown, although their explanations to others suggest they do understand that group payoffs are maximized when all contribute fully.\n\nThey show patience with temporary miscoordination: even when others misunderstand the mechanism or reverse their decisions, this player maintains full contributions and instead uses communication to clarify what should be done.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nTheir tone is friendly, brief, and cooperative. They engage early with a simple greeting and then use the chat primarily to support coordination around full contributions. They explicitly endorse the “everyone contributes everything” strategy and later clarify how the decision interface should be interpreted, indicating that they are both attentive to others’ confusion and willing to help correct it.\n\nThey are responsive to social dynamics: when another player seems to imply that some birds are not cooperating, they defend their own cooperative status without aggression, asking for clarification in a neutral way. They express positive reinforcement when the group finally reaches high, synchronized contributions again, celebrating the restored cooperation with a short appreciative comment. Their communication style is low‑volume but targeted: they speak when it can help coordination, clear up misunderstandings, or affirm group success, rather than chatting for its own sake.\n\nThey do not pressure or shame specific individuals; instead, they talk in general terms about what “we” should do and about how the interface should read. This suggests a mild, prosocial, norm‑setting style rather than a confrontational or punitive one. They respond to others’ apologies and confusion by offering constructive guidance, not blame. Overall, they engage but do not dominate the conversation, and they use language to align the group around cooperative norms.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey never spend any coins on reward, even when others clearly cooperate and even when they themselves receive rewards from others multiple times. Their willingness to reward is therefore either zero or extremely low in this environment. They do accept and acknowledge cooperative behavior via chat (e.g., verbally affirming when the group finally all contributes fully again), but they do not translate that approval into use of the formal reward mechanism.\n\nGiven that the cost and benefit of reward are symmetric here, the lack of rewarding is not obviously profit‑maximizing versus neutral; it is more consistent with an assumption that formal reward is unnecessary, that cooperation should be its own norm without side payments, or that they prioritize keeping their own payoff once they have already contributed fully. They may view full contribution as sufficient pro‑social action and see additional reward spending as redundant or costly without added value. They also never appear to threaten or promise reward in chat, nor do they mention the reward mechanism, indicating it is not central to their strategy.\n\nTheir reinforcement of norms is thus primarily verbal and by example rather than through incentive manipulation. They rely on modeling perfect cooperation and using brief, positive communication to guide others, rather than paying to selectively reinforce behavior. Whether they would reward in a setting where reward is more clearly efficacious or differently structured is unknown."

Initially, they follow a proposed intermediate contribution level before explicit group consensus on full giving emerges; once the group norm of maximal contribution is articulated, they immediately commit to contributing their entire endowment and state this commitment publicly. They then maintain full contributions even when others later reduce theirs, showing norm adherence rather than strict conditional cooperation. Their behavior suggests they value group efficiency and fairness, appear comfortable sacrificing private payoff to achieve the socially efficient outcome, and show low sensitivity to short-term exploitation. They do not adjust downward in response to others’ free-riding, indicating either a principled cooperative stance or low reactivity to defection within the short time horizon.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nTheir communication is sparse, direct, and norm-focused. They engage only a few times, primarily to state intended contributions and clarify their past behavior relative to the evolving group standard. They respond to others’ emerging consensus by aligning with it rather than attempting to lead or propose their own target. Their tone is cooperative and matter-of-fact, without visible frustration or confrontation. They make a point of transparently explaining that an earlier, lower contribution occurred before the group reached a shared plan, implying a concern for being seen as fair and consistent. They do not challenge or criticize others, even when later contributions fall below the discussed standard; instead, they reiterate the cooperative frame (“we all did 20”) and implicitly assume compliance, suggesting a preference for positive coordination over conflict.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey never use the punishment option despite having multiple opportunities and clear evidence of others contributing less than the discussed norm. They also do not verbally endorse punitive strategies when another player raises the idea of sanctioning low contributors. This pattern suggests a strong reluctance to engage in costly punishment, even when free-riding occurs and when social license for punishment is implicitly offered in chat. Their likely motives lean toward maintaining group harmony and avoiding antagonism rather than using sanctions for deterrence or retaliation. Whether they would ever punish in more extreme circumstances is unknown, but in this context they appear to be a non-punishing or very high-threshold punisher.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey observe that others sometimes earn higher payoffs while contributing less but do not react with visible anger, complaints, or calls for sanctions. Their chat emphasizes the shared cooperative narrative rather than the payoff asymmetries that disadvantage them. This indicates tolerance of moderate exploitation and a low tendency toward envy-based or reciprocity-based responses within the short game. They seem more focused on sustaining or reaffirming the cooperative identity of the group than on correcting individual deviations or restoring payoff equality. How they would respond to repeated or escalating free-riding over a longer horizon is unknown, but in the observed setting they remain consistently cooperative and non-retaliatory."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a strict, unconditional full contributor. They always give their entire endowment to the public fund and never deviate, even when another player briefly free-rides or when reward patterns fluctuate. They align immediately with the emerging group norm of maximal contribution and never attempt to test, exploit, or respond to deviations. Their behavior fits a norm-following, efficiency-focused cooperator who prioritizes maintaining high group payoffs over individual short-term gain. There is no observable conditionality on others’ contributions; they continue to fully contribute despite one instance of zero contribution by another player and without any visible concern about being exploited. They appear risk-tolerant regarding potential free-riding and place strong weight on the cooperative norm once it is established. They treat full contribution as the obvious or “correct” choice and do not renegotiate that standard, suggesting a stable fairness or efficiency norm: everyone should give the maximum so everyone earns more.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nTheir communication is brief, cooperative, and supportive. They engage enough to affirm group norms and coordinate but do not attempt to dominate discussion. Early on, they express positive surprise at the high returns from cooperation and explicitly agree with the “always give maximum” norm. They acknowledge others’ plans for mutual benefit and respond succinctly, indicating alignment and consent rather than initiating new strategies. When asked about game structure (like the number of rounds), they provide straightforward information rather than speculation or pressure. Later, they encourage the group with a general compliment on performance and reason about reward schemes by noting that everyone must participate for side-contracts to work. Their tone is consistently friendly, polite, and constructive; there is no aggression, blame, or sarcasm toward anyone, including the one-time defector. They show awareness of payoff logic and use chat to clarify that coordinated rewarding is only beneficial if universal, but they stop short of actively organizing or enforcing that scheme. Overall, they communicate as a cooperative team member who values clarity and mutual benefit rather than as a strong leader or enforcer.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey never use punishment at any point, even when there is a clear opportunity: another player fully free-rides once while everyone else, including them, continues to contribute fully. They do not respond to this with sanctions, complaints, or even subtle social pressure. There is no evidence of retaliatory motives or willingness to use costly punishment for deterrence. This suggests either an aversion to punishment on principle, a belief that the cooperative norm is sufficiently stable without sanctions, or a preference to avoid conflict and negativity. Given their consistent full contributions despite no punishing and despite occasional asymmetries in reward receipt, they appear willing to absorb mild exploitation rather than introduce punitive dynamics. They behave as a non-punitive cooperator who relies on positive norms, rewards, and group goodwill instead of harm-based enforcement. Any inclination to punish is unknown but appears at most very low in practice.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey are an active but selective user of rewards, with a clear preference for reinforcing cooperation and reciprocating kindness. They reward only others, never themselves (self-reward is not possible), and they never pair rewards with punishment. Early in the interaction, they explicitly commit to rewarding after another player notes having given rewards without receiving any, and they follow through by distributing rewards broadly across cooperative group members. Over time, they alternate between periods of extensive, almost egalitarian rewarding of many or all contributors and periods of no rewarding, even while everyone continues to cooperate. They frequently include players who have been communicative or who express concern about being left out of rewards, and they occasionally target subsets rather than the entire group, suggesting a mix of reciprocity, gratitude, and perhaps an attempt at payoff balancing for specific individuals. They show some understanding of the underlying payoff logic, recognizing in chat that mutual rewarding can increase earnings if everyone participates, and they restate that this only works under full mutual compliance. However, they do not consistently enforce or follow that mutual-reward scheme once it becomes clear that not everyone always rewards; instead, their rewarding becomes more sporadic and selectively generous rather than strictly payoff-maximizing. Overall, they function as a prosocial rewarder: willing to spend their own payoff to thank, include, or support others, more motivated by reinforcing cooperation and fairness perceptions than by precise strategic optimization."

They consistently contribute the maximum possible amount in essentially every round, including early and late in the game, and they revert immediately to full contribution after a single deviation. Their one deviation is an abrupt switch to zero contribution after a long stretch of unanimous full cooperation, which is then immediately punished by the group. After experiencing that punishment, they resume full contributions and maintain them through the end. This pattern suggests that their default norm is “everyone gives everything,” and they are willing to test a selfish deviation once, but they treat the group’s negative response as binding and fall back into the cooperative norm. There is no evidence that they condition their contribution on others’ prior contributions, since others are always fully cooperative; their lone defection seems more like opportunistic experimentation than a response to observed unfairness. They do not appear to chase short‐term profit aggressively; after being sanctioned, they prioritize staying aligned with the group. Risk tolerance around norms is moderate: they risk a single, conspicuous free ride despite strong group talk of always giving, but once sanctioned, they do not push further. Overall, they behave as a high, stable cooperator whose contributions are guided more by group expectations and maintaining harmony than by detailed payoff calculations.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nTheir communication is sparse, light, and affiliative rather than strategic. They occasionally respond to others with short, friendly comments and mild humor, and they explicitly affirm that they will follow the group’s cooperative plan when others endorse full contribution. They do not initiate complex coordination schemes or propose detailed reward/punishment strategies, but they readily agree when other players discuss general cooperative norms or collective plans. They acknowledge shared experiences (like waiting for the game to start) and show a tendency to validate others rather than to criticize. Their engagement style is reactive and low-effort: they speak when prompted by others’ remarks or when the social tone invites small talk, but they do not use chat to negotiate incentive structures, enforce norms, or question others’ behavior. Even when other players discuss mutual rewarding to improve earnings, they remain silent on that strategic discussion and later simply signal agreement in principle without changing their own action pattern. Overall, they present as socially agreeable, deferential to group norms, and conflict-averse, with minimal use of communication as a tool for influence.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey never use punishment, even when they are the clear target of punishment after their own free-riding attempt. This indicates a strong reluctance to engage in retaliatory behavior or to use sanctions as a normative tool. They do not punish low contributors (including themselves when they defect), nor do they respond to being punished with counter-punishment or visible indignation. The absence of any punishment use, despite experiencing a substantial sanction, suggests they either (a) disapprove of spending resources to harm others, (b) strongly prioritize avoiding escalation and conflict, or (c) focus narrowly on their own payoff without seeing punishment as a worthwhile investment. Because other players maintain full contributions, they never face a choice about punishing chronic defectors; hence their stance on third-party punishment of others’ unfairness is unknown. However, their pattern is consistent with a non-punitive, non-confrontational type who absorbs sanctions and adjusts behavior rather than trying to discipline others.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey also never use rewards, despite repeated periods where others are fully cooperative and despite group discussion about using mutual rewards to raise earnings. This shows an unwillingness to spend personal resources to positively reinforce others, even when the group frames symmetrical mutual rewarding as profitable. They receive nontrivial amounts of reward from others and sometimes acknowledge group plans verbally in a supportive way, but they do not reciprocate via the mechanism itself. This combination—accepting rewards, continuing to cooperate, but not giving rewards—suggests a type who values cooperation enough to contribute fully, but either does not internalize the additional norm of active reciprocity through costly reward, or evaluates the reward mechanism as not worth its cost. Their non-use persists even when others explicitly revisit and endorse mutual rewarding near the end, which indicates that it is a stable preference rather than inattention. Overall, they are a high contributor who free-rides on others’ reward efforts: they benefit from others’ generosity without engaging in strategic reinforcement themselves, and they rely on basic contribution norms rather than incentive engineering to sustain cooperation."

They do not condition their contribution level on rewards, punishments, or small deviations by others; even after a visible defection, they maintain maximal contribution rather than cutting back. This suggests a strong, stable cooperation norm rather than a reactive or contingent one. They appear risk-tolerant with respect to potential free-riding: they prioritize maintaining the cooperative equilibrium and high group payoffs over protecting themselves against occasional exploitation. Fairness for them seems to mean “everyone contributing fully,” and they act as if that standard is both expected and achievable.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nTheir tone is friendly, succinct, and cooperative. They endorse the high-contribution strategy explicitly and frame it as a shared “plan” for “big bonuses,” reinforcing group norms rather than arguing or lecturing. They sometimes ask simple clarification or coordination questions (for example about whether everyone is rewarding) and occasionally make brief motivational comments about earning more money. They acknowledge others’ coordination proposals and express agreement, even when they do not fully follow through behaviorally later. They do not challenge or confront others directly about their actions; even when someone defects, they do not call them out in chat. Instead, they use chat mainly to reinforce collective strategies, signal generosity (“I give everyone”), and align verbally with group-wide reward schemes. Their engagement style is cooperative and encouraging but low-intensity: they participate enough to coordinate, not to dominate the conversation or negotiate in detail.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey almost never use punishment and show no interest in retaliatory behavior generally. The sole instance of punishment occurs immediately after the only clear defection from full contribution. In that case, they target the lone defector and apply a substantial sanction, while leaving all other players untouched. This pattern is highly selective and consistent with a norm-enforcing motive: punishment is reserved for clear, unambiguous deviation from a well-established full-contribution standard. They do not punish anyone else at any other time, even when discussions around rewards, fairness, and earnings might have given them justification to sanction “under-rewarders.” This suggests they view punishment as a tool to deter outright free-riding on contributions, not to fine-tune fairness in the reward stage or to retaliate for low generosity. Their willingness to bear a nontrivial personal cost to punish a single defector indicates a commitment to protecting the cooperative norm, but they keep punishment rare and targeted rather than using it routinely.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey are a high, sometimes extreme, rewarder with a strong inclination toward inclusive generosity. They frequently spend significant resources to give positive incentives to others, often distributing rewards broadly and symmetrically across all cooperating peers. This behavior is consistent with a strategy of reinforcing the fully cooperative equilibrium and signaling goodwill rather than maximizing immediate personal payoff. At several points they experiment with giving no rewards or selectively rewarding just one or a few partners, suggesting some sensitivity to their own net earnings and to whether others are also rewarding. However, they repeatedly return to wide, almost egalitarian reward distributions, and explicitly describe themselves as giving to everyone. They do not appear to condition rewards on fine-grained differences in others’ behavior; as long as others are contributing fully and broadly aligned with the group, they tend to treat them similarly. The single defector receives no reward and instead is punished, showing that rewards are reserved for cooperators. Overall, they use reward as a primary tool to sustain cooperation and express solidarity, accepting short-run personal costs in exchange for maintaining a generous, high-trust environment."

This suggests a strong internal norm or rule (“always contribute the maximum”) rather than a responsive, contingent strategy.\n\nThey tolerate free-riding without any observable strategic adjustment. Even when at least one partner persistently keeps everything, they do not reduce their own contributions or attempt to sanction through contribution withholding. This indicates a high willingness to bear exploitation risk and a low propensity to protect themselves materially in the short term.\n\nTheir pattern aligns with a social or moral preference for efficiency and group benefit over individual payoff maximization. Given the game’s parameters, full contribution is payoff-dominant but individually dominated; their unwavering cooperation suggests either: (a) a principled cooperative type who values doing “the right thing” independently of others’ choices, or (b) a simple heuristic: when in doubt, contribute fully. There is no evidence of exploration or experimentation with the low-contribution option.\n\nFairness concerns appear weaker than efficiency concerns.

Temporal risk tolerance is also high: they do not appear to hoard endowment late in the game, despite uncertainty about when the game ends.\n\nOverall, this player is best described as a robust, norm-driven cooperator: they follow an internal cooperative rule with little volatility and negligible sensitivity to short-term exploitation.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThe player does not send any chat messages in the observed interaction. Their communication style is therefore unknown; there is no direct evidence of tone, persuasion attempts, or explicit coordination from them.\n\nHowever, they consistently align their behavior with the cooperative norms that other players attempt to promote via chat. While others talk about contributing fully, they quietly conform from the outset and maintain this pattern even when others are inconsistent. This suggests they are at least receptive to a cooperative framing of the game, though it is unclear whether this is due to the chat or pre-existing preferences.\n\nThey do not publicly confront free-riders, request fairness, or press for reciprocity; this may reflect a conflict-avoidant or low-engagement style, or merely a preference for acting rather than talking. Because they remain silent even when others discuss contribution levels and game length, their responsiveness to social information through communication channels is uncertain. All observable responsiveness is inferred indirectly through their consistent cooperative behavior, not through written interaction.\n\nIn sum, their personality and social style in communication channels are largely unknown; what is clear is that they engage through actions rather than words, cooperating steadily without using chat to coordinate, persuade, or sanction."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a stable, unconditional full cooperator. They always contribute their entire endowment, showing no sensitivity to marginal personal returns, free-riding opportunities, or small deviations by others. Their behavior suggests a strong internal norm to “do the socially efficient thing” and maintain maximum group provision, independent of short-term self-interest. They do not appear to condition their actions on others’ exact contribution levels; even when one group member briefly contributes less, they continue to fully cooperate without punishment, reduction, or visible protest. This indicates high tolerance for minor norm deviations and a preference for norm stability over reactive adjustment. The player appears comfortable bearing the risk that others may not fully match their cooperation; they prioritize the collective outcome and adherence to a simple “always contribute everything” rule rather than calibrating contributions to protect themselves.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThe player does not send any chat messages, despite others using chat to encourage cooperation. This reflects a silent, non-leadership communication style: they neither initiate coordination nor verbally reinforce emerging norms. Instead, they “speak” through their consistent contributions. Their lack of verbal engagement suggests either low desire to manage others’ behavior directly, low need for social signaling via talk, or simple preference/comfort with passive participation. They are nonetheless responsive in the behavioral sense: they align their contributions with the emerging high-cooperation norm, but they do not explicitly praise, pressure, or negotiate with teammates. Overall, they are a quiet cooperator who supports group goals through action rather than words.\n\n<REWARD>\nThe player never uses the reward mechanism, even when others are clearly cooperating at high and stable levels and when rewarders are identifiable to recipients. This indicates a strong reluctance to spend personal resources on direct positive incentives or gratitude payments, even in a fully cooperative environment. Their strategy appears to be: contribute maximally, but do not pay extra to influence or thank others. This could reflect several possibilities (all with low confidence): they may view contribution itself as sufficient cooperation; they may not see additional benefit from rewarding in an already cooperative group; they may be conserving payoff; or they may be indifferent or uncomfortable with active, targeted social interventions. There is no evidence that their decision to withhold reward is punitive; it is uniformly applied and not contingent on others’ actions. They are thus best described as a “non-rewarding cooperator”: they help via public good contributions but do not invest in second-order cooperation through reward.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nNo rewards are given to this player, so their response to being rewarded is unknown. There is no evidence about whether they would reciprocate rewards, form alliances with rewarders, or shift behavior after receiving recognition. Given their general pattern, the safest characterization is that their contribution behavior likely remains stable and high regardless of social reinforcement, but this is inferred with low confidence and not directly observed."

They always contribute their full endowment in every round, even when others free-ride heavily, when coordination attempts to “refuse to donate” emerge, and when the game reaches the final round. Their strategy does not appear to adjust to changes in group behavior, observed defection, or horizon effects. This suggests either a fixed norm of “always contribute” or a deliberate choice to prioritize group efficiency over individual earnings, regardless of others’ actions. They tolerate substantial exploitation by free-riders without retaliating or downgrading their own contributions. Their behavior is consistent with a strong cooperative or rule-following type rather than a conditional cooperator or payoff-maximizer.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThey speak minimally and only once, to offer a brief greeting at the start. They make no further comments on strategy, fairness, rewards, or others’ behavior, and they do not join norm-enforcement talk or shaming of free-riders. They do not try to persuade, coordinate, or react to emerging coalitions, even when others explicitly discuss contribution strategies and “refusing to donate.” This indicates a low-engagement, quiet style: they participate behaviorally through their contributions but not socially through chat. Their tone in the one message is neutral and polite; beyond that, their stance toward conflict, persuasion, or group governance is unknown.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThey maintain full contributions through to the final round, despite explicit reminders that it is the last round and clear suggestions from others to stop contributing. They show no observable end-game decay or attempt to exploit the final period. Awareness of the horizon is likely (the information is visible and discussed), but they do not act on it strategically. This pattern is consistent with a horizon-insensitive cooperative rule: they behave the same early and late in the game, even when short-term incentives to free-ride are strongest.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey never spend on rewards, even when others reward high contributors and when rewarding behavior is visible and identifiable. They do not experiment with targeted rewards, reciprocity, or coalition-building via positive incentives. Their refusal to engage with reward persists across conditions: when rewards are actively used by some, when they are not used by most, and when they could be used to reinforce cooperation or retaliate against non-cooperation. This suggests either that they view rewards as unnecessary or inefficient, that they are strongly payoff-conserving in this dimension, or that they simply choose a “no reward” rule and stick to it. They cooperate via contributions but avoid paying extra to shape others’ behavior.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThey receive a small amount of reward early in the game but never reciprocate to those who reward them or to other contributors. They also do not acknowledge reward in chat. There is no sign that being rewarded affects their later decisions about rewarding or contributing; their contributions remain maximally cooperative, and their use of the reward mechanism remains absent. This fits a type that is non-reciprocal in the formal reward channel: they neither build alliances through mutual rewarding nor respond to generosity with targeted payback. Whether they feel gratitude internally is unknown; behaviorally, they ignore the reward mechanism, both as giver and as strategic responder.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey show no behavioral reaction to others’ payoffs, reward expenditures, or free-riding. Despite visible exploitation by non-contributors and visible use of rewards by some players, they neither adjust contributions downward nor engage in sanctioning or compensatory rewarding. They do not comment in chat on others gaining more by not contributing, nor on the perceived unfairness or irrationality that other players discuss. Their choices stay fixed at full contribution, regardless of others’ earnings or strategies. This suggests a type that is either norm-driven (“I contribute because that’s what you’re supposed to do”) or extremely tolerant of unequal outcomes, with low inclination to enforce social norms or protect themselves against exploitation. Their beliefs about others’ motives and rationality are unknown; their behavior indicates that such beliefs, if present, do not alter their own cooperative rule."

They always give their full endowment, even when others start withholding and even when there is explicit group coordination pressure to stop contributing. They appear to prioritize collective efficiency over short‑run individual gain, and they do not visibly condition their contributions on others’ past behavior or on end‑game proximity. There is no evidence of retaliation or strategic free‑riding; they tolerate being exploited by low contributors without adjusting downward. Their risk tolerance for being the “sucker” is high, and they seem more guided by a simple cooperative rule (“always contribute”) than by nuanced payoff maximization or fairness balancing.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThey communicate rarely but pointedly. When they speak, it is to question the usefulness of the reward mechanism or to comment critically on group behavior. Their tone is direct and mildly dismissive when others push for non‑contribution, suggesting some frustration with what they see as irrational or norm‑violating choices. They do not attempt detailed coordination on contribution levels, nor do they join the blame or targeting of specific low contributors. Their engagement style is low‑volume, with short, evaluative remarks rather than sustained dialogue or persuasion. They respond more to structural concerns (mechanism design, others’ aggregate behavior) than to interpersonal drama.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThey show no end‑game decay in cooperation. Even when others explicitly argue that, because the game is almost over, everyone should stop contributing, they continue to give fully. They appear aware that the game has a fixed, short horizon, but this does not alter their rule of behavior. They resist last‑round defection pressure and even express a negative judgment of those who follow it, implying a stable internal norm that is not relaxed at the end. There is no visible attempt to “cash out” or to exploit the final round.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey never use the reward option, despite being eligible every round and despite at least once receiving a reward from another player. Their earlier statement indicates skepticism about the instrumental value of rewarding, suggesting they see no payoff advantage or coordination benefit in spending coins this way. There is no evidence they use reward as reciprocity, as a signal of alliance, or as a way to promote cooperation. Their strategy with respect to prosocial incentives remains purely contribution‑based; they separate their willingness to cooperate from any willingness to incur extra costs to influence others through rewards.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThey receive a reward in one instance but do not respond in chat or through reciprocal rewarding. There is no observable gratitude, alliance formation, or attempt to reciprocate to that specific player or to reward anyone at all. Their subsequent behavior—continued full contribution without adopting rewards—suggests they treat the reward as irrelevant to their decision rule. Whether they internally appreciate it is unknown; outwardly they neither escalate cooperation beyond their existing maximum nor mirror the reward behavior.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey notice that the reward mechanism appears unused or ineffective and openly question its point, indicating attention to others’ payoff‑relevant actions at the mechanism stage. However, they do not comment on specific individuals’ payoffs, nor do they single out free‑riders or rewarders for praise or blame. When others coordinate around non‑contribution and some exploit high contributors, they react by criticizing the group as a whole rather than adjusting their own choices or engaging in targeted sanctioning. Overall, they observe outcome patterns enough to form a skeptical belief about rewards and a negative judgment of collective free‑riding, but they keep their own behavior fixed and avoid personalized responses to particular players’ gains or losses."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a stable, unconditional full cooperator across all rounds. They always give their entire endowment to the public good, regardless of what others do, how contributions around them fluctuate, or how close the game is to ending. They do not appear to condition their behavior on others’ past contributions, on observed free-riding, or on group-level trends; they continue to fully contribute even when many others clearly benefit more by withholding. This pattern suggests a strong internal norm or rule (“always contribute fully when MPCR is high”) rather than payoff-maximizing adaptation. They show high risk tolerance in the sense of willingly exposing themselves to exploitation and persistently accepting lower relative payoffs compared to defectors. Fairness concerns, if present, do not translate into reduced contributions; they do not attempt to restore equity via defection. Their strategy is cooperative, rigid, and non-retaliatory.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThey do not send any chat messages. They also do not visibly reference or react (via behavior shifts) to specific chat content. This indicates a low-engagement or silent participation style in communication channels: they listen (or at least observe outcomes) but remain nonverbal. They neither try to coordinate nor persuade others, and they do not publicly shame free-riders or praise cooperators. Their social style in this environment is passive and non-confrontational. It is unknown whether they internally care about others’ remarks or group norms; behaviorally, they abstain from explicit social interaction and let their contribution pattern speak for itself.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThey maintain full cooperation through the final round, despite clear awareness in the group that the game horizon is short and that many others are starting to deviate from full contributions. They do not shift to defection when others propose end-game non-cooperation, and they do not attempt to exploit the last round. There is no sign of cooperation decay in their play; their behavior is time-invariant from start to finish. This suggests either that they do not adopt backward-induction logic in their strategy, or that they follow a consistent principle that disregards the end-game incentive to free-ride. They also do not use the final round to experiment with alternative strategies like conditional defection or signaling.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey never use the reward mechanism. They do not reward high contributors, do not attempt to incentivize group cooperation, and do not reciprocate when others (if it occurred) reward someone else. Since they themselves are never rewarded, there is no observed opportunity to see direct reciprocal rewarding from them. Their unwillingness to spend on rewards holds even when rewarding might help reinforce a highly cooperative phase, and even though the cost/benefit is symmetric for giver and receiver. This pattern indicates a preference to avoid side-payments altogether, suggesting that they focus solely on direct contributions as their cooperative act. It is unknown whether they avoid rewarding because they see no strategic benefit, because they are conserving payoff, because they are confused about its purpose, or because they adhere to a norm of “cooperate but don’t engage in extra mechanisms.”\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThey are never observed receiving any reward, so there is no evidence of how they respond to being rewarded or of any reciprocal alliance-building. Consequently, their propensity to reward back benefactors, form stable cooperative subgroups via mutual rewards, or signal gratitude through the mechanism is unknown. Given their overall refusal to use rewards at any point, even without personal experience as a recipient, a reasonable (but still low-confidence) inference is that they would be unlikely to reciprocate even if rewarded; however, this remains speculative and should be treated as unknown.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey observe others’ outcomes and can see who defects and who contributes, as well as who spends on rewards, but they never adjust their own behavior in a way that reflects strategic reaction to these observations. They continue full contributions despite visible free-riding that gives others higher payoffs, and despite others experimenting with rewards. They neither join nor counteract emergent patterns of exploitation or retaliation via changing their own contribution level or using the reward tool. They do not appear to condition on the presence of extreme cooperators or extreme defectors; high-earning free-riders do not trigger any observable response. Their stance is behaviorally invariant: others’ payoffs, costs, and strategic moves do not modulate their actions. This suggests a type that is cooperative by principle rather than by contingent response to others’ outcomes, with learning or adaptation to the strategic landscape being minimal or absent (at least within this short game)."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a strict, unconditional full contributor. They always give the entire endowment to the public fund and never deviate, even as others fluctuate and as their own relative payoff is persistently lower than that of several group members. There is no evidence of conditional cooperation; their behavior does not adjust upward or downward in response to higher or lower average contributions, nor to changes in who is contributing more or less. They appear to hold a strong internal norm that “the right thing” is to fully contribute regardless of what others do, and they tolerate being exploited by lower contributors without reacting in their own contribution choice. Risk tolerance is high in the sense that they persist with full cooperation despite clear information that others free-ride and that this leaves them earning less than others. Fairness norms seem to be internally driven rather than reciprocal: they behave fairly (by contributing fully) but do not condition on whether the environment is fair to them.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey never use punishment at all, despite repeated and salient opportunities and despite the presence of clear low contributors and a powerful, high-leverage punishment technology. They also see other players frequently using punishment (in particular against a chronically low-contributing target), yet they neither join in nor imitate this behavior. This suggests a very high threshold for punishing; either they avoid harming others on principle, or they reject the cost of sanctioning as an acceptable tool, even when it would be efficient or group-beneficial. There is no sign of retaliatory punishment, as they are never punished themselves and never punish in return. There is also no sign of using punishment strategically for deterrence or norm enforcement; they do not appear to try to shape others’ contributions through negative incentives. Overall, they present as a non-punisher with strong reluctance to impose costs on others, even on clear free riders.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nUnknown. They are never the target of punishment, so there is no evidence of how they respond when punished or how they treat identifiable punishers afterward. Their tendencies toward unconditional cooperation and non-punishment suggest, with low confidence, that they would be unlikely to retaliate and might either ignore punishment or possibly interpret it as information rather than a provocation, but this is speculative.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey never use rewards, despite the mechanism being clearly explained and despite visible examples of others using positive rewards. They do not reward either high contributors who match their own behavior or players who reward them. This indicates that they do not engage in explicit positive reinforcement, alliance signaling, or gratitude expression through the reward tool. Given that they already cooperate maximally without conditioning on others, they may see rewarding as unnecessary, too costly, or outside their preferred way of interacting. Their cooperativeness is “silent”: they help the group through contributions but do not invest extra resources to shape or encourage others’ behavior via rewards.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThey receive rewards several times from specific co-players, but they never reciprocate with rewards of their own and they do not alter their contribution behavior, which is already at the maximum. There is no observable attempt to form a mutual-reward alliance or to differentially favor those who reward them versus those who do not. Their gratitude, if present, is not expressed through the available mechanisms. This suggests a style where they maintain their own cooperative standard independently of social approval or side payments, and do not translate being rewarded into explicit reciprocity via the reward tool. Whether they feel gratitude internally is unknown; behaviorally, they remain unchanged and non-reciprocal with respect to rewards.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey repeatedly observe that some players contribute less while earning higher payoffs and sometimes also face heavy punishment from others. Despite this clear evidence of free-riding, payoff inequality, and active sanctioning norms in the group, they neither adjust their own contributions nor participate in enforcement. They tolerate being a consistent net contributor who often earns less than others without any visible attempt to protect themselves or to pressure laggards. They similarly observe positive rewards flowing among others (and to themselves at times) without changing their behavior. Overall, they appear largely indifferent, in terms of strategic adjustment, to others’ payoffs, to how much others spend on punishment or reward, and to who is targeted. Their primary reference point seems to be their own internal rule to fully cooperate, not the evolving distribution of costs and benefits in the group."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a generally high, prosocial contributor who treats near-full provision to the public fund as the default. They consistently give most or all of their endowment, with only small downward deviations. The pattern suggests an internal norm that contributing heavily is “what one does,” rather than a purely opportunistic choice.\n\nContribution levels are relatively stable and clustered at the cooperative end of the scale, indicating low volatility. When they do lower their contribution, the reduction is modest rather than extreme, implying aversion to outright free-riding and a desire to remain clearly on the cooperative side.\n\nTheir behavior is weakly conditional on others: they continue to contribute highly even when partners’ inputs fall, but they are not completely rigid. Occasional decreases in their own contribution coincide with evidence that others are sometimes giving less, suggesting mild conditional cooperation under frustration or uncertainty, not strict tit-for-tat. They never move into clear defection despite repeated exposure to much lower contributions from at least one peer, which points to a strong fairness or efficiency norm and low willingness to “punish” by under-contributing.\n\nThey appear to prioritize group efficiency and fairness over short-term individual payoff. Persistently high contributions even when others lag behind are consistent with someone who values maintaining a cooperative climate and is tolerant of some inequality in contributions. Their few partial contributions suggest some attention to their own payoff, but self-interest is bounded by a strong cooperative identity.\n\nRisk tolerance is moderate to high in social terms: they repeatedly invest heavily into a public fund despite uncertainty about future punishment, remaining rounds, and others’ strategies. They seem comfortable risking exploitation to preserve cooperation, implying either optimistic beliefs about others’ intentions or a principled commitment to contribution regardless of others’ behavior.\n\nOverall, their contribution “type” is: resilient high contributor, mildly conditional but reluctant to sanction via defection, with a strong internal cooperation norm and a willingness to sustain high contributions even in imperfect groups.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nTheir communication style is sparse but norm-focused and gently moralizing. When they do speak, they explicitly question the rationale for using costly punishment in a way that frames it as primarily “mean,” indicating a prosocial, harm-averse orientation and a view that deliberate deductions are socially undesirable unless strongly justified. This reflects a preference for positive-sum interaction and suspicion of punitive tools.\n\nThey participate in early norm formation around punishment, prompting others to reflect on why they would ever use it. This is a soft attempt at coordination: they introduce a frame where punishment is both unkind and instrumentally questionable, and others verbally align with this stance. They are thus willing to initiate group-level norms but do so in a low-pressure, non-confrontational tone.\n\nThey respond to the emerging group culture with light, affiliative engagement (e.g., brief playful participation after others joke), rather than driving the conversation. This suggests they value social harmony and belonging but do not seek a dominant or directive role in chat. Their engagement style is cooperative and affiliative, not argumentative.\n\nThey do not directly confront specific low contributors or call out individuals by name, consistent with an avoidance of interpersonal conflict. They frame their comment about punishment in general terms, keeping it abstract and impersonal. This implies a preference for maintaining positive relationships and cohesion, even when others behave in ways that reduce efficiency.\n\nThey also show responsiveness: they contribute to the tone once another player makes a joke and others “laugh.” This indicates they attend to social cues and are willing to join in group bonding when it aligns with their cooperative stance.\n\nIn sum, their communication style is: low-volume, norm-shaping, conflict-averse, and oriented toward establishing a non-punitive, friendly cooperative environment rather than detailed strategic coordination or direct pressure on deviants.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey never use the punishment option at any point, despite repeated exposure to others who contribute much less. This persistent non-use indicates a very high threshold for imposing costs on others and a strong reluctance to harm, even when doing so could be justified as second-order punishment of free-riding.\n\nTheir early explicit statement questioning why anyone would ever deduct, and labeling such behavior as essentially “mean,” provides direct evidence of their underlying punishment norm: they view punishment as morally suspect and socially undesirable, and they apparently do not find its instrumental value compelling in this context. Their behavior matches their stated belief; there is no evidence of hidden or later reversal.\n\nThey show no signs of retaliatory motives. Even when their own payoff falls due to others’ low contributions, they do not respond with deductions. This suggests they are not driven by anger-based reciprocity and are willing to absorb some exploitation to avoid harming others.\n\nThere is also no indication of strategic deterrence use: they do not send threats, do not hint at possible future punishment, and do not employ even minimal sanctions to shape others’ behavior. This aligns with either a belief that punishment is collectively inefficient or an ethical stance that harming others for strategic gain is unacceptable, or both. The transcript does not allow differentiating clearly between these, so the relative weight of moral vs. instrumental reasoning is unknown.\n\nThey appear to rely exclusively on positive cooperation (continued high contributions, mild norm talk) rather than negative incentives to sustain group outcomes. Their “type” in punishment space is therefore: principled non-punisher / anti-punitive cooperator—someone who rejects costly sanctions both in practice and in stated attitude, tolerating some degree of free-riding rather than employing direct harm as a corrective tool."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a stable, near-unconditional high contributor. They repeatedly give the maximum possible amount and only very slightly reduce contribution once, despite facing persistent free-riding by at least one player and occasional low contributions by another. Their cooperation does not appear contingent on recent punishment against them, on others’ contribution averages, or on changing group size. They behave as if guided by a strong internal norm that the “right” action is to fully invest in the public fund, even when it is individually exploitable in the short run. They do not visibly experiment with lower contributions to test responses or to protect themselves from free-riders. Risk tolerance for being exploited is high: they keep contributing fully even after being directly punished and while low contributors obtain higher material payoffs in several periods. Fairness, if present, is enforced via punishment rather than by withdrawing cooperation.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nUnknown. There is no chat content in the transcript, so their tone, persuasion style, and responsiveness in written communication cannot be inferred. It is unknown whether they attempt to coordinate via messages, explain their actions, or remain silent.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThey show no classic end-game unraveling in contributions: their giving level remains maximal through to the final round, with no visible decline as the game horizon approaches. Instead, they continue to use punishment in the last period, indicating that they still act as if norms and enforcement matter even when no future interaction is possible. This suggests that their enforcement behavior is at least partly driven by intrinsic norm-upholding or immediate fairness concerns rather than purely by strategic long-term incentives. There is no evidence that awareness of remaining rounds materially weakens their cooperative stance.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey are an active and costly punisher, especially toward persistently low contributors. They regularly spend nontrivial amounts on punishment, including in situations where the targeted players’ relative payoffs are already low but their contribution level remains below the group norm. This pattern aligns with norm-enforcing (altruistic) punishment: they appear willing to incur personal costs to reduce the payoff of players who chronically contribute almost nothing, even when such punishment is not clearly profit-maximizing. Their punishment is selective: they focus on clear under-contributors and do not attack evident high contributors. They also sometimes increase punishment intensity over time on chronic free-riders rather than tapering off, consistent with frustration or an escalation mindset when norm violations persist. When they themselves are punished, they do not respond with obvious counter-punishment at the expense of high cooperators, nor do they abandon contributions, suggesting that retaliation is not their primary driver. Overall, their punishment style fits a “strict enforcer” type: costly, norm-based, and directed at defectors rather than at random or at cooperators.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey pay attention to both contributions and resulting payoffs and appear particularly sensitive to situations where low contributors end up with higher or comparable earnings than cooperators. Their punishment choices track contribution behavior rather than who is earning the most overall: they target players who repeatedly contribute almost nothing even when those players sometimes end up with modest or reduced payoffs due to others’ sanctions. They tolerate fellow high contributors keeping strong relative earnings and do not attempt to equalize income across cooperators. When other norm enforcers or aggressive punishers act, they do not visibly adjust their own contributions downward or cease punishing, implying they are not easily discouraged by the group’s internal punishment dynamics or by being personally hit with deductions. They behave as if fairness is defined by contribution behavior (cooperate vs free-ride), not by payoff equality, and they maintain their cooperative and punitive pattern regardless of fluctuations in who is currently ahead or behind in total payoffs."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a strong, almost unconditional cooperator. They consistently give the full endowment to the public fund in nearly every round, including the very first and the very last. The only exception is a single mid-game deviation where they contribute half their endowment while the group is broadly cooperative; this looks more like an experiment or temporary adjustment than a strategy shift, as they immediately return to full contributions and then maintain them through to the end. Their behavior indicates a stable fairness norm that favors high cooperation regardless of whether others free-ride. They tolerate persistent low contributions by at least one player without using their own contribution level as a retaliatory tool. They seem risk-tolerant regarding exploitation and prioritize maintaining a high-contribution environment over guarding against being taken advantage of. There is no clear evidence that their contributions are conditionally responsive to others’ individual choices; instead, they act as a consistent “moral anchor” for cooperation.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nUnknown. There is no chat content in the transcript, so their tone, persuasion attempts, and responsiveness in communication cannot be inferred. Their behavioral pattern (steadfast high contributions plus intermittent punishment) is consistent with someone who might advocate for fairness and cooperation, but this is speculative and unsupported by direct evidence.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThey show clear horizon awareness (the number of rounds is visible), but they do not reduce cooperation as the game approaches the final rounds. In the closing phase, they maintain maximal contributions and keep using punishment selectively, including in the very last rounds. There is no decay in their cooperative behavior or obvious “last-round defection.” Their pattern suggests they treat the end-game similarly to earlier stages, remaining focused on norm enforcement and group welfare even when there is no future opportunity for others to reciprocate. Any subtle adjustments in punishment size near the end appear small and do not amount to a qualitative shift in strategy.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey are clearly willing to incur substantial personal costs to punish. They do not punish in every round, but when they do, they often spend a non-trivial portion of their payoff. Their punishment is selective and appears targeted at players whose behavior deviates from a cooperative norm: primarily very low contributors or those who repeatedly contribute far less than the group of high contributors. They sometimes punish even when group contributions are already high, consistent with enforcing a principle (“everyone should at least match the group norm”) rather than purely responding to immediate payoff losses. Their punishment is not obviously tit-for-tat or retaliatory against those who punish them personally; instead, it seems oriented toward norm enforcement and deterrence, even at a net cost to themselves. They do not escalate indiscriminately when they receive deductions; after absorbing punishment from unknown others, they continue to cooperate and sometimes still punish apparent free-riders rather than attempting broad revenge.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey appear attentive to how others’ contribution and punishment choices translate into payoffs. When they punish, they often choose amounts that significantly reduce a target’s payoff, indicating sensitivity to the relative advantage that low contributors or non-punishers might gain. They do not mimic others’ strategies in a straightforward way: even when others gain by contributing little or by spending heavily on punishment, this player does not follow those patterns. Instead, they maintain their own cooperative standard and use punishment to narrow payoff gaps created by perceived free-riding. They do not reward high contributors, even implicitly, beyond maintaining high contributions themselves. There is no clear evidence of resentment-based targeting of players who end up with particularly high payoffs if those players are also cooperative; their concern seems more about contribution fairness than about absolute earnings. Overall, they respond to outcome patterns by reinforcing cooperation through stable giving and by strategically penalizing behavior that undermines that outcome structure."

They always allocate their entire endowment to the public fund, even when others defect or when defection appears profitable. Their behavior suggests a strong internal norm favoring maximum collective efficiency over personal earnings. They do not condition their contributions on others’ past or current behavior, nor on observed punishment patterns. There is no evidence of strategic adjustment, experimentation, or hedging; they maintain the same cooperative choice in the presence of persistent free-riding and heavy punitive activity by others. This implies either a principled commitment to contribution, a belief that sustained cooperation is optimal regardless of others’ deviations, or a lack of concern with fine-tuning payoffs. Their tolerance for being exploited by non-contributors appears high, and they do not react by reducing cooperation, indicating a preference for norm-following or efficiency over outcome-based reciprocity. Risk tolerance regarding payoff variance is unknown; what is observable is a willingness to accept lower relative payoffs to uphold a cooperative norm.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey never use the punishment option, despite repeated exposure to non-contributing peers and clear evidence that others are willing to incur substantial costs to sanction defectors. This consistent non-use holds regardless of whether free-riders are lightly or heavily punished by others, and regardless of whether defectors are repeat offenders. Their pattern is best described as non-punitive or pacifist within the game: they forego both first-order enforcement (punishing defectors) and any form of second-order punishment (punishing cooperators who do or do not punish). The transcript does not allow them to express their reasoning, so their underlying motives are uncertain. Plausible interpretations include a strict payoff-maximization at the individual level regarding punishment (avoiding the direct cost), a deontological aversion to harming others even when they defect, or a reliance on others to perform enforcement (“free-riding” on punishment while still contributing). Because they always cooperate yet never punish, they do not fit the classic “strong reciprocator” profile; instead, they align more with a “pure cooperator” type: contributing fully without engaging in costly enforcement. There is no sign of retaliatory, strategic, or signaling use of punishment.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nThey are never punished in the observed play, so direct responses to being sanctioned cannot be inferred. Consequently, their propensity for forgiveness, retaliation, or compliance in the face of personal punishment is unknown. Since punishers are identifiable in this environment but they never become a target, there is no evidence of them engaging in counter-punishment or reward-like compensatory behavior toward those who punish others. Their combination of full cooperation and zero punishment might make them an unlikely punishment target in general, but that remains speculative. Overall, their behavioral response to punishers is unknown, and their sensitivity to social signaling via punishment cannot be determined from the available data.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey observe substantial variability in others’ contributions, payoffs, and punishment behavior, including repeated free-riding by some players and heavy, targeted sanctions imposed by others. Despite this, they maintain unchanged full cooperation and zero punishment. They do not appear to adjust behavior in response to the severity or direction of punishment (who gets punished, how much is spent, or how much is deducted), which suggests they are not using others’ outcomes as a learning signal for strategic adaptation. They also do not appear to respond to fairness cues: even when free-riders obtain relatively high payoffs before or after punishment, the focal player does not shift toward defection or enforcement. This indicates low behavioral reactivity to inequality, exploitation, or aggressive sanctioning by others. There is no evidence of them rewarding or aligning with particular “coalitions” of punishers or cooperators; they simply keep contributing maximally and refrain from intervening, regardless of the emerging payoff landscape. Their implicit belief about others’ future behavior is unknown, but their actions imply that they do not rely on predictive adjustments: they behave as if their own norm of cooperation is largely independent of how others are currently performing or being treated."

They always contribute their entire endowment, regardless of how others behave or how the group’s average contribution changes. Their behavior suggests a strong internal norm favoring full contribution rather than a conditional “cooperate if others do” rule. They do not visibly adjust to repeated free-riding by some group members, indicating either principled commitment to cooperation, indifference to relative disadvantage, or an instrumental belief that consistent high contributions are best for long-run payoffs. They appear risk-tolerant with respect to exploitation: they keep contributing fully even when low contributors earn more in those periods and even when punishment by others is already heavily targeting defectors. Overall, they act as a pure, norm-driven cooperator who does not condition on others’ fairness or on apparent endgame considerations.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey never use the punishment option, despite recurrent and sometimes severe free-riding by others and despite clear evidence that other cooperators are willing to spend heavily to sanction low contributors. This indicates a strong reluctance to engage in costly punishment, even when it would be norm-consistent (punishing defectors) and socially supported (many others are doing it). The most direct inference is that they prioritize preserving their own payoff and/or avoiding harming others, over enforcing contribution norms. Motives could include a pacifist or non-interventionist disposition, an efficiency concern about the deadweight loss from punishment, or uncertainty about the fairness or accuracy of punishing specific individuals; which of these dominates is unknown. They also never punish in response to any prior pattern of others’ contributions or punishment behavior, suggesting they are not motivated by retaliation or by strategic deterrence. Their punishment behavior is best described as strictly non-punishing and non-retaliatory.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nThey are never targeted with punishment in the observed interaction, so their direct reaction to being punished is unknown. However, they clearly see that some players repeatedly spend substantial amounts on punishing others; despite this, they neither join in punishing nor shift their own contribution pattern. This implies that the mere presence of active punishers does not induce them to become an enforcer or to lower their contributions out of fear or resentment. Their likely stance toward punishers is tolerant or at least non-confrontational: they do not counter-punish, do not imitate, and do not visibly adjust behavior to align with punishers’ apparent norms. Whether they would forgive or retaliate if personally punished is unknown and cannot be inferred with confidence.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey consistently observe that defectors sometimes earn more and are sometimes heavily punished, while punishers incur large costs. Despite this, they make no observable adjustments either toward free-riding (to match high private payoffs) or toward punishing (to support norm enforcement). This suggests they are not strongly payoff-comparative: relative earnings and others’ costs do not appear to drive their choices. They also do not appear to “reward” cooperators via differential punishment (e.g., sparing some and punishing others), since they never punish at all. They seem behaviorally “decoupled” from others’ outcomes: they maintain their own cooperative strategy regardless of whether cooperation is collectively rewarded or undermined by defectors. Learning or adaptation to the emerging incentive landscape is minimal or absent; they behave as if guided by a fixed rule (“always contribute fully; never punish”), rather than by responsive updating to observed payoffs, sanctions, or evolving group norms."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a strict, stable full contributor. They always give the entire endowment and never deviate, even when a few others free‑ride at the start and at the end. Their behavior suggests they treat full contribution as the obvious, default “correct” action rather than a contingent response. Early comments show they hold a fairness and efficiency norm that everyone should contribute; they frame non‑contributors as “selfish.” Once the group reaches universal cooperation, they maintain full contributions without hesitation, apparently prioritizing group payoff and norm consistency over individual short‑term gain. They do not appear to condition contributions on others’ recent behavior in any fine‑grained way; instead they exhibit a rule‑based strategy: everyone ought to contribute fully, including themselves, regardless of small deviations. Risk tolerance around being exploited is relatively high—they keep cooperating even when a free‑rider briefly appears again near the end. Their choices are highly predictable and non‑volatile.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nTheir tone is norm‑setting and mildly moralizing but not hostile. Early on, they actively try to coordinate the group around full contributions, explicitly stating that contributing is best for everyone and discouraging selfishness. Once cooperation is established, they mostly step back, offering occasional positive reinforcement to the group and encouraging them to “keep it going.” They do not join off‑topic banter and ignore side conversations about geography, earnings platforms, or jokes; their communication is task‑focused and sparse. They respond to the group’s success with brief praise, aligning themselves with cooperative group identity. They show no signs of aggression, sarcasm, or trolling, and they do not escalate when others defect; instead they rely on gentle social pressure and a single explicit threat of sanction to support the cooperation norm. Responsiveness to others is selective: they engage when it concerns contribution behavior and norms, but otherwise remain quiet.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey never actually use the punishment mechanism, despite having multiple opportunities and at least two clear instances of others contributing nothing. However, they explicitly state a conditional intention to punish a specific low contributor if that behavior continues, targeting a repeat defector rather than punishing immediately. This suggests they are willing in principle to use punishment as a deterrent against persistent free‑riding, but prefer to give others a chance to comply after social pressure. They appear selective: sanctions are reserved for clear, repeated norm violations, not one‑off mistakes. They do not express any desire for revenge, only for enforcing contribution norms. Once the target complies, they drop the idea and never revisit punishment, even when another player defects later; that last defection occurs against a backdrop of strong overall cooperation and end‑game uncertainty, and they still abstain from punishing. Overall, they are a reluctant, conditional punisher who prioritizes communication and group coordination over costly sanctions.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nThey are never punished in this game, so their direct reactions to being sanctioned are unknown. They never observe a need to retaliate or to respond publicly to punishment, because no one targets them. Based on their general style, if punished in a future setting, they are more likely to interpret it as norm enforcement than as a personal attack, and could update or at least acknowledge it, but this is speculative and low confidence. Their behavior provides no evidence of retaliatory tendencies or of forgiving explicit punishers, so their exact response pattern to identifiable punishers remains unknown."

They always contribute their entire endowment, showing no experimentation and no apparent sensitivity to others’ occasional low contributions. Their behavior is consistent with a strong internal norm of “maximal cooperation” rather than outcome-based adjustment. They do not appear to condition their contribution on group averages, on the presence of free riders, or on prior punishment/reward received. This suggests a rule-based or norm-following strategy: they decide that full contribution is the “correct” action and stick to it. Risk tolerance appears moderate to high: they accept exposure to exploitation by lower contributors without hedging. Their fairness notion seems oriented to “doing their part” rather than enforcing proportionality or reciprocity in contributions, since they never reduce their own contribution in response to others contributing less.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThe player is a *non-punisher* in practice. They never use punitive options, even when there are clear low contributors who benefit from the public fund. This reluctance holds despite punishment being relatively efficient at reducing others’ payoffs. They thus show no observable inclination toward either deterrence or retaliation. The absence of any punishment, combined with unwavering full cooperation, is compatible with several possible motives: disliking payoff destruction on principle, prioritizing their own earnings, or doubting the effectiveness or justice of anonymous punishment when individual impacts are hard to track. Because they never punish, their specific triggers or selectivity thresholds remain unknown. There is no evidence that being punished themselves motivates any punitive response; they do not escalate or “even the score.” Overall, they behave as a high-cooperation, low-enforcement type: willing to contribute but not to incur additional costs to discipline free riders.\n\n<REWARD>\nThe player is also a *non-rewarder* in practice. They never spend resources to reward others, even though many group members match their full-cooperation strategy. This suggests they do not use positive incentives as a strategic tool, either to encourage high contributors or to build reciprocal ties. Their consistent refusal to reward, together with their non-punishing stance, points to a generally low willingness to spend beyond the initial contribution, even for prosocial regulation. Whether this reflects a belief that rewards are unnecessary, an effort to protect their own payoff after contributing fully, or low confidence in the impact of anonymous rewards is unknown. They do not appear to use rewards as gratitude signals for being rewarded themselves; receiving rewards does not change their non-rewarding pattern. In sum, they are a pure unconditional cooperator who leaves the incentive environment untouched: they rely entirely on their own contribution rather than on rewards or sanctions to shape group behavior."

They always give the maximum possible amount to the public good in every decision, regardless of what others do, whether others free-ride, whether contributions dip, or whether they themselves are occasionally targeted with deductions. Their behavior is extremely stable and non-conditional: they do not adjust contributions downward in response to free-riding, to uneven contribution patterns, or to being punished. They therefore appear principled or rule-driven rather than outcome-responsive.\n\nThey show no evidence of experimenting with selfish deviation, even when they would clearly profit monetarily by contributing nothing while others contribute fully. This suggests that they prioritize a cooperation norm or efficiency motive over individual payoff optimization. Their willingness to keep contributing fully despite sometimes being singled out with small deductions indicates tolerance for risk and for exploitation: they accept the possibility of unfair outcomes without changing their cooperative stance. There is no indication that they track or react to small deviations in others’ contributions; they contribute fully both in perfectly cooperative environments and when there are one or two non-contributors.\n\nOverall, their contribution pattern is best described as unconditional, high-cost cooperation anchored in a stable internal norm (e.g., “always do the socially efficient thing”) rather than responsive reciprocity.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThis player never uses punishment at any point, despite frequent opportunities and many clear targets (low contributors, extreme punishers, and erratic rewarders). Their willingness to absorb the cost of others’ defection and of being punished themselves, without ever punishing back, indicates an aversion to using sanctions as a tool.\n\nThey do not retaliate when they personally receive deductions; they also do not engage in third-party punishment of clear low contributors or heavy free-riders on others’ reward efforts. Given that they repeatedly observe strong punishment against low contributors and against particular individuals, their inaction looks intentional rather than uninformed. This suggests either a principled rejection of punitive behavior (“I don’t do punishment”) or a strict efficiency calculus that sees punishment as too wasteful, even when it might deter future defection.\n\nThey also do not appear to use punishment strategically to signal toughness or enforce norms. Their stance is consistent with a non-punitive, non-retaliatory type who tolerates norm violations and noise rather than paying to discipline others.\n\n<REWARD>\nThis player also never uses reward, despite being surrounded by others who sometimes spend heavily on rewarding. They receive positive transfers from multiple others in various cooperative phases but never reciprocate with reward behavior, even in periods of uniformly high contribution where rewarding cooperators could be justified either by gratitude or by a desire to stabilize cooperation.\n\nTheir refusal to reward holds even when many others are clearly willing to incur substantial costs to reward the group. This makes it unlikely that they simply “don’t understand” the mechanism; instead, they seem to regard reward as unnecessary or inefficient. They show no use of reward as a strategic tool for reinforcing full contributions or attracting future reciprocity, nor as an emotional response to being rewarded.\n\nTaken together with their non-use of punishment, they appear to adopt a “pure contribution only” approach: they contribute maximally to the public good but opt out of all second-order mechanisms, whether positive or negative.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThis player is behaviorally indifferent to others’ payoffs, punishment, and reward activity in the sense that these observations do not alter their own strategy. They observe severe punishment of some players, heavy reward-giving by others, occasional free-riding, and spontaneous waves of cooperation and sanctioning, yet their own pattern—always full contribution, no sanctions, no rewards—remains unchanged.\n\nThey do not appear to reward those who reward them, nor punish those who deduct from them. This suggests they either (a) do not place weight on fairness in second-order interactions, focusing only on their own contribution norm, or (b) consciously separate “what I do” (contribute fully) from “what others do,” choosing not to engage in payoff-based responses.\n\nTheir lack of behavioral adjustment in response to being occasionally targeted with deductions implies a high level of tolerance for inequality and noise: they absorb unfair or unexplained hits without attempting to correct them or signal disapproval. At the same time, they do not exploit others’ generosity; they never take advantage of reward-heavy or punishment-enforced cooperative phases by secretly defecting. Instead, they seem to treat the entire environment—others’ contributions, punishments, and rewards—as background conditions, while they adhere rigidly to a simple personal policy: always cooperate fully, and never spend on social control.\n\nIn summary, this player is a “principled non-enforcing cooperator”: they consistently maximize their contribution to the group, ignore both temptations to free-ride and opportunities to sanction or reward, and remain unaffected in behavior by the complex and sometimes extreme payoff patterns generated by others."

They generally give the full endowment whenever they participate, showing a strong intrinsic preference for full cooperation rather than careful calibration to others’ behavior or to the marginal per-capita return. They do not systematically adjust contributions in response to moderate free-riding by specific peers; instead, they continue contributing fully through both high and low group-contribution phases. This suggests that immediate payoff maximization is not their primary motive; they likely value maintaining a cooperative norm and/or see themselves as “the kind of person” who contributes.\n\nTheir behavior is mostly stable: they stick with maximal contributions over the bulk of the game despite changes in others’ contributions and in group efficiency. The few deviations from full contribution are inconsistent rather than part of a clear tit‑for‑tat or threshold strategy, implying low confidence that they are conditionally cooperating in a fine-grained way. The late-game partial and zero contributions indicate that they are not strictly rule-bound; they are willing to break their own previously implied cooperative pattern in some circumstances, possibly when they infer the interaction may be ending or when they briefly prioritize own-payoff. Overall, they show a strong fairness orientation toward “everyone putting in,” but they do not strongly sanction or systematically downshift in response to individual under-contributors, which points to relatively high tolerance for inequity in the short run.\n\nRisk tolerance appears moderate: they repeatedly expose themselves to the risk that others will free-ride on their high contributions, but they also occasionally withhold or reduce contributions without explicit justification. This mix suggests they care more about sustaining a cooperative atmosphere than about tightly managing payoff variance. They seem comfortable enduring some exploitation for the sake of group benefit, but not locked into rigid altruism.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nTheir communication style is light, affiliative, and explicitly prosocial. They commit in public chat to a non-punitive stance and align with others who question the value of punishment, which signals a cooperative identity and an attempt to build a shared group norm against deductions. They show a sense of humor and wordplay, using a pun on their avatar name and responding playfully to others’ light messages. This indicates they value rapport-building and positive emotion in the group, not just instrumental coordination about contributions.\n\nThey do not use chat to instruct, shame, or pressure specific players about their contributions, even when some group members contribute little or nothing. Instead, their comments center on general principles (e.g., not deducting) and social bonding. This suggests an avoidance of direct confrontation and a preference for soft, norm-based influence rather than explicit persuasion or criticism. They respond to others’ messages, acknowledge jokes, and participate in brief back-and-forth exchanges, showing that they attend to group communication and are socially engaged rather than withdrawn.\n\nThere is no clear evidence that they try to coordinate precise contribution levels or conditional strategies. Their communication focuses more on values (non-punishment, friendliness) than on concrete plans. This points to a personality that is cooperative and relationship-oriented, with a mild leadership element in setting moral tone but not in micromanaging collective strategy. They do not appear defensive or reactive in chat, and there are no signs of hostility or resentment, even when free-riding occurs. Overall, their style is friendly, reassuring, and non-accusatory.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey never use the punishment mechanism and explicitly declare that they do not deduct, which they then follow through on consistently. This reveals both a stated norm and a behavioral commitment to non-punitive interaction. Their stance is aligned with others who argue that deduction is either mean or irrational, making it likely that they see punishment as socially undesirable and/or as an inefficient, self-harming tool that reduces total payoffs. Their behavior is consistent with a “cooperative pacifist” type: willing to contribute generously but unwilling to incur costs to sanction defectors, even when low contributions reduce their own earnings.\n\nBecause they never punish, there is no observable selectivity; they do not distinguish between light and heavy free-riding in their sanctioning behavior. There is also no evidence of retaliatory motives; they do not respond to under-contribution with punishment, and they do not appear to seek deterrence via the threat of sanctions. Instead, they rely entirely on positive example (high contributions) and norm talk in chat (anti-punishment statements) as their tools for shaping behavior. They accept the risk that free-riders may persist unpunished and do not attempt to correct this through the available mechanism.\n\nTheir refusal to punish remains stable across contexts, including when others contribute substantially less or more than they do. This suggests that their non-punitive stance is a principled preference rather than a narrow response to the specific cost/benefit parameters of punishment in this game. Whether they would ever punish in dramatically different environments (e.g., extremely harmful defection, different punishment efficiency) is unknown, but within the observed setting they are a consistent non-punisher."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a flexible, opportunistic contributor who mixes medium cooperation with episodes of near-complete free-riding. They alternate between contributing roughly half of their endowment and contributing almost nothing, with occasional token amounts. Their behavior suggests they want to benefit from the public good without being the worst contributor, and they sometimes match or slightly undercut the prevailing contribution norm rather than either leading cooperation or fully exploiting it.\n\nThey show moderate responsiveness to group behavior: when they are heavily targeted by punishment after low contributions, they reliably jump back up to mid-level contributions in subsequent rounds. When punishment pressure eases, they are willing to return to low or minimal giving, indicating conditional cooperation driven by sanctions more than by an internal fairness norm. They do not insist on perfectly equal contributions; instead, they appear comfortable contributing less than many others as long as punishment risk remains manageable.\n\nTheir risk tolerance is moderate: they do at times take the risk of very low contributions even after previous costly sanctions, but they do not escalate to extreme, consistent defection once they see that sanctions can be severe. Instead they oscillate, suggesting a willingness to “test” how much free-riding is tolerable, then retreat toward the group norm when sanctions become intense.\n\nOverall, this is a sanction-sensitive, strategic free-rider: not a pure defector, but someone who prefers contributing less than cooperative peers and adjusts upward primarily in response to observed costs rather than intrinsic commitment to fairness.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nAwareness of the finite horizon does not produce a simple monotonic decay in cooperation. Instead, the player continues their pattern of alternating between mid-range contributions and very low contributions through the later part of the game. Even very late, they sometimes cooperate at moderate levels and sometimes free-ride, rather than converging on full defection.\n\nSevere punishment episodes near the end are followed immediately by higher, more cooperative contributions, indicating that direct payoff feedback matters more to them than abstract end-game logic. They do not appear to adopt a final-round “grab everything” policy; they are still willing to contribute almost nothing in some late rounds but also still return to medium contributions after that. This suggests that, although they can see how many rounds remain, their horizon awareness is weaker than their short-run response to sanctions.\n\nIn summary, their end-game behavior is best described as continuing sanction-driven conditional cooperation with opportunistic dips, rather than a deliberate backward-induction collapse of contributions.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThis player never uses the punishment mechanism, despite multiple opportunities and despite being a repeated target of costly sanctions themselves. They absorb substantial deductions without retaliating or attempting to discipline low contributors, suggesting a strong reluctance to spend their own resources on norm enforcement.\n\nTheir non-use of punishment persists across cooperative and non-cooperative phases, indicating a stable trait rather than a situational oversight. This aligns with a payoff-maximizing stance toward the second-order public good: they treat punishment as an unnecessary cost, even when it might deter future sanctions against themselves or stabilize cooperation. There is no evidence of anger-driven retaliation, moralistic punishment, or targeted norm enforcement; their motives appear purely first-order (own payoff from contributions and redistributions), not second-order (shaping others’ behavior via punishment).\n\nTheir type is therefore “non-punishing, sanction-sensitive free-rider”: they respond to being punished by adjusting contributions but never themselves invest in punishing others."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a low-to-moderate contributor who free-rides substantially relative to the group while occasionally making mid-range contributions. Their average contribution is clearly below the group average, and they never contribute fully. Contribution levels fluctuate rather than following a simple increasing or decreasing trend, suggesting they experiment or react to the environment rather than follow a fixed rule. They sometimes move from very low to much higher contributions and then back down again, indicating conditionality: they are willing to contribute more when others seem broadly cooperative and the public good is large, but they still keep their own contribution well below what many peers provide. They appear comfortable benefiting from high-contributing others and do not systematically match the highest contributors, which is consistent with partial free-riding rather than strict fairness or equality norms. Their pattern suggests moderately high risk tolerance in the sense of relying on others’ cooperation to keep returns high, while keeping their own exposure (contribution) muted. Normatively, they do not appear driven by “everyone should contribute equally”; instead they seem to accept and exploit asymmetric roles where some players carry more of the cost.\n\n<REWARD>\nThis player is an active user of the reward mechanism and spends nontrivial amounts on rewarding across many rounds. They sometimes spend nothing and sometimes spend enough that rewards clearly matter for their own payoff, so they are willing to incur meaningful costs to shape others’ incentives. Their rewards are not purely self-interested in the narrow, one-shot sense, because they at times pay enough in reward costs to noticeably reduce their own immediate earnings. However, they do not reward in every cooperative context; their use of reward is selective and intermittent. The most consistent trigger appears to be others’ visible cooperative behavior (high contributions, or perhaps persistence in cooperation across states where some players free-ride). They rarely, if ever, appear to systematically reward obvious low contributors, suggesting they are not trying to “pull up” defectors as much as reinforce those already contributing or already being pivotal. They do not clearly chase rewards given to them (gratitude signaling is ambiguous); sometimes they are rewarded yet do not reciprocate in a way that is obviously targeted. Overall, they use rewards as a strategic tool: they are willing to pay to reinforce cooperative norms they benefit from, but they do so in a discretionary, somewhat noisy manner rather than following a strict tit-for-tat or proportional rule.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThis player appears attentive to others’ outcomes and to extreme behaviors. They observe when some players spend very large amounts on rewards or end up with very low or very high payoffs, and their later reward behavior suggests they adjust in light of such patterns. They tend not to “punish” low contributors via negative payoffs (punishment is unavailable) or by withholding benefits in a fully targeted, systematic way, but they also do not go out of their way to compensate them. They seem more responsive to cooperative peers who either maintain high contributions or who incur substantial costs to sustain cooperation; these individuals are more likely to be the targets of the player’s reward spending, indicating a preference for reinforcing visible prosocial effort. When others’ outcomes show large sacrifice for the group (e.g., heavy reward spending or consistently high contributions), the player is more willing to spend their own coins even when it reduces their own payoff, implying that they value rewarding such behavior or see it as instrumental to maintaining a profitable cooperative environment. When many others are earning high payoffs with limited or moderate reward use, the player tends to relax their own reward spending and revert to more self-protective contributions. Overall, they behave as a conditional, strategic cooperator: they track who is “doing a lot for the group” versus who is merely riding along, and they use their reward budget to encourage the former while allowing themselves to remain a relatively low contributor. Their personality profile in this setting is pragmatic and outcome-focused, more interested in sustaining a high-payoff environment than in enforcing strict fairness or equality."

They clearly understand that full free‑riding is individually lucrative in this environment, yet they do not adopt it as a strict, permanent rule. Instead, they alternate between three distinct modes: (1) full contribution, (2) medium/typical contribution around the emerging group norm, and (3) zero contribution while others still contribute substantially. They do not appear to follow a simple linear reciprocity rule; high contributions from others sometimes coincide with their own high contribution and sometimes with zero. This suggests they track the broader “game state” (who tends to reward whom, and how profitable cooperation currently is) more than they track exact contribution fairness each round. They tolerate being above or below the group average without an immediate corrective response. Risk tolerance toward social backlash appears moderately high: they repeatedly free‑ride in the presence of strong pro‑social rewarding by others, implying low fear of being sanctioned (since only reward is available). Their pattern fits a “strategic opportunist in a friendly environment”: willing to contribute when it seems compatible with earning high payoffs, but also willing to exploit cooperative norms when they see that others are funding high public good levels and rewards.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nAwareness of the finite horizon is present but does not drive a simple monotonic end‑game defection. Late in the game, the player alternates between zero, medium, and full contributions rather than settling into a pure free‑ride phase. They still make some of their highest contributions near the very end while also taking advantage of free‑riding opportunities in adjacent rounds, indicating a flexible exploitation/cooperation mix rather than a straightforward “cooperation decay” toward zero. The absence of punishment removes fear of retaliation, so their end‑game strategy appears to be: maximize immediate round payoff subject to maintaining access to reward from generous others. They do not show evidence of caring about long‑term reputation beyond the current game, as they are willing both to free‑ride and to contribute fully in the very last rounds, depending on the immediate structure of others’ behavior. Overall, they treat the end game opportunistically rather than normatively.\n\n<REWARD>\nThe player uses reward occasionally but not consistently, and sometimes very intensely at substantial personal cost. They are willing to spend large fractions of their payoff on reward in some rounds, then spend nothing in others. This suggests they view reward as a tactical tool rather than a standing moral obligation. They primarily use reward to reinforce high or norm‑compliant contributors and to respond to others’ rewarding patterns, but their reward behavior is noisy rather than rule‑based. There are episodes where they sacrifice much of their own earnings to distribute reward widely, implying that, in some states of the game, they temporarily prioritize influencing others’ behavior or reciprocating generosity over maximizing their own immediate payoff. At other times they abstain from rewarding entirely while continuing to accept large amounts of reward from others, which shows a willingness to free‑ride specifically on the reward mechanism itself. They do not systematically “tip” every cooperator; instead, they selectively reward in bursts, likely when they sense a cooperative coalition is worth supporting or when they feel gratitude toward recent benefactors. Their reward use is therefore best described as strategic, reactive, and inconsistent, rather than purely altruistic or purely self‑interested.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nBecause rewarders are identifiable, the player is in a position to build alliances and reciprocate targeted kindness. Their behavior indicates some reciprocity, but not in a strict or symmetric way. When they receive substantial reward in certain stretches, they sometimes respond in subsequent rounds with heavy spending on reward toward high contributors and active rewarders, implying a willingness to “pay it forward” or signal gratitude to the cooperative cluster. However, there are also long sequences where they are a net beneficiary of others’ rewards without offering comparable return, indicating weak obligations to strict reciprocal fairness. The player seems to treat being rewarded as a signal of inclusion in a cooperative subgroup, which occasionally triggers a pro‑social phase where they both contribute more and reward heavily. Yet they are comfortable relaxing this reciprocation once they feel secure that the cooperative group and its rewarders will persist without constant reinforcement from them. Overall, they display partial, context‑dependent reciprocity to rewarders and do not commit to stable bilateral alliances.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThe player closely attends to others’ contributions, payoff levels, and reward expenditures, and adjusts their own behavior in light of these observations. When they see others spending heavily on reward and sustaining high contributions, they often respond by either (a) joining with medium‑to‑high contributions and, at times, costly rewarding, or (b) exploiting the situation by contributing nothing while reaping the benefits of both the public good and incoming rewards. They do not punish low contributors (punishment is unavailable), nor do they reliably withdraw cooperation in the face of others’ free‑riding; instead, they seem to rely on the fact that several players remain strongly pro‑social. Other players who burn large amounts of coins on rewarding do not deter them from free‑riding; indeed, they sometimes double down on zero contributions once they see that others’ generosity can sustain the public good and their own high payoffs. The player appears to infer that some group members are “unconditional cooperators” or “reward fanatics” and then strategically ride on this. At the same time, when they observe cooperative peers suffering lower payoffs due to heavy rewarding, they occasionally step in with their own large reward outlays, suggesting intermittent concern for reinforcing those who are taking on costs for the group. In sum, they are highly responsive to the pattern of others’ expenditures and payoffs, but their responses alternate between opportunistic exploitation and episodic support, reflecting a flexible, payoff‑aware, and moderately socially attuned type."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a mostly high contributor with intermittent free-riding and mild conditionality. They frequently give the full endowment or a clearly above-average amount, especially while the group maintains strong cooperation. They sometimes cut contributions to half the endowment or even to zero, particularly after having benefitted from the group and when others’ cooperation patterns or the situation make defection less risky. The shifts are not chaotic: they alternate between full cooperation and partial or full defection in ways that keep their own payoffs high while not fully abandoning the public good. They tolerate being slightly above or roughly at the group contribution level and do not systematically undercut high contributors. Their behavior suggests they understand the efficiency of contributing but also opportunistically exploit cooperative environments. Fairness norms are present but weak: they do not consistently match others’ effort levels, nor do they reliably avoid profiting from others’ higher contributions. Risk tolerance appears moderate: they are willing to deviate from full cooperation when others seem stable enough that the public good is not in danger, but they revert to full contribution when the environment could be fragile or when uniform high cooperation re-emerges.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThere is no clear monotonic end-game collapse in their cooperation; instead, they maintain a mixed pattern of full contributions and occasional free-riding through the late rounds. They continue to invest fully even in the final round and also engage in nontrivial reward spending late, indicating that they remain strategically and socially engaged rather than purely myopic at the horizon. However, they also use some late-round zero-contribution moves, implying that they are aware of the finite horizon and occasionally take advantage of it when it seems especially safe or profitable. Overall, they display partial, not complete, end-game defection: they neither cling rigidly to cooperation nor switch to pure exploitation when the game is nearing its end.\n\n<REWARD>\nThis player is a light and selective rewarder. Most rounds they choose not to spend on rewards at all; when they do, they spend modest amounts rather than engaging in large-scale redistribution. Their reward decisions are infrequent, suggesting they do not see themselves as a primary enforcer of cooperative norms. When they do reward, they appear to use it as a targeted signal rather than as a routine payment—likely directed toward players who contribute well or who have been important for their own earnings. They are willing to incur costs for reward even when it substantially reduces their own payoff in that round, which implies that they value influence, relationship signaling, or norm support, but only in specific circumstances. They do not display a clear pattern of “rewarding everyone who cooperates”; instead, their use of reward is sparse, strategic, and situational. There is no evidence that they use reward to deliberately subsidize low contributors toward higher future cooperation.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThey often receive rewards yet rarely reciprocate them directly or consistently, even though rewarders are identifiable. This indicates low dyadic reciprocity: they do not use reward to build explicit alliances or bilateral exchange relationships. Being rewarded does not systematically alter their own spending on rewards in subsequent interactions, nor does it lock them into higher contributions than they otherwise choose. Their main response to being rewarded is to keep benefiting from the cooperative environment rather than to repay specific individuals. This suggests they interpret incoming rewards more as generalized approval or as noise than as obligations; they are comfortable accepting positive treatment without mirroring it. Their social style is thus opportunistically appreciative but noncommittal: they do not retaliate against rewarders, but they also do not transform those relationships into stable mutual-reward pacts.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey carefully exploit the information on others’ contributions, reward costs, and payoffs but use it mainly to adjust their own contribution level rather than to actively manage the group via rewards. When others pour substantial resources into reward, they do not necessarily match that intensity; instead, they often free-ride on others’ enforcement, letting heavy rewarders shoulder the cost of sustaining cooperation while they maintain good but not maximal cooperative behavior. They show no systematic tendency to compensate those who sacrifice large amounts of payoff to reward others; high reward expenditures by peers do not reliably trigger their own rewards. Likewise, they do not punish or systematically withhold cooperation in reaction to particular individuals’ high payoffs or low contributions; any conditionality is diffuse rather than person-targeted. Overall, they respond to the outcome environment by modulating their own contributions and occasionally sending small positive signals, but they avoid taking on a central role in outcome correction or norm maintenance."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is best described as a “mostly free-riding, opportunistic conditional cooperator.” Their default is to keep their entire endowment and rely on others’ contributions. Across the game they choose the zero-contribution option in the vast majority of rounds, with a small number of full-contribution choices interspersed. This pattern indicates a stable preference for self-maximization with only occasional cooperative deviations rather than random noise.\n\nThey clearly understand the payoff structure: they benefit substantially when others contribute while they do not, and they act in line with that incentive. When they do contribute, it occurs in environments where cooperation from others is already strong. This suggests they are not trying to initiate cooperation but sometimes join when cooperation is already “safe” and widely adopted.\n\nTheir behavior does not show a strong fairness norm. They repeatedly free-ride on groups where most players contribute fully. There is no visible compensatory behavior (either through consistent contributions or heavy use of reward) that would indicate a concern about equity between themselves and high contributors. Their occasional cooperative rounds look more like experiments or weak conditional cooperation than a stable fairness principle.\n\nRisk tolerance appears moderate to low with regard to unilateral cooperation: they almost never take the risk of being among the few contributors in an otherwise non-cooperative group. Instead, they align their rare contributions with already high group contributions, reducing the risk of being exploited. They demonstrate no sign of “moral sticking” to contribution once they have tried it; they revert easily back to free-riding even after cooperative episodes, suggesting outcome sensitivity rather than commitment to a cooperative identity.\n\nThey do learn about the environment in the sense that they maintain free-riding despite seeing high average contributions from others. This is consistent with a belief that others will continue to contribute enough for the public good to be worthwhile without their help, and that there is no strong social or institutional pressure (punishment is absent; reward is anonymous) that would make defection costly for them.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nAwareness of the finite horizon does not produce a standard “end-game collapse” pattern because the player is already predominantly non-cooperative from early on. In the final segment of the game they remain almost entirely non-contributing, in line with their general strategy rather than as a new shift. There is one cooperative episode relatively late, but they do not escalate cooperation near the end, nor do they show a smooth monotonic decline; instead, behavior remains opportunistic and mostly unchanged.\n\nThis suggests that they understand that late-round contributions cannot be reciprocally rewarded in future rounds in any strong sense and thus maintain a payoff-focused stance. Their one late cooperative action looks more like a localized response to very high group cooperation than to the proximity of the final round.\n\nThey do not exhibit an “end-game generosity” pattern or a last-round symbolic contribution; in the final rounds they free-ride while others still contribute heavily. This is compatible with a narrow, outcome-based view of the game rather than a concern for reputation that extends beyond the game. Overall, the end-game does not fundamentally alter their strategy; it just reinforces their baseline of minimal giving.\n\n<REWARD>\nThis player is extremely reluctant to spend on rewards. In almost all rounds they choose not to allocate any reward units, despite frequently receiving rewards from others, sometimes in substantial amounts. This asymmetry—benefiting from rewards while rarely giving any—points to a strongly self-oriented payoff motive in the use of the reward mechanism.\n\nWhen they do reward, it is infrequent and low in magnitude. The few instances of spending on rewards occur in contexts where they themselves contribute. This pattern is most consistent with a conditional, targeted reinforcement strategy: they are willing to invest a small amount to support a cooperative configuration that they are currently part of. It is less consistent with unconditional gratitude or a norm-based sense of “thanking” contributors, because they do not reward in most of the many rounds where others contribute and they free-ride.\n\nThey do not use rewards to systematically reshape others’ behavior: there is no consistent pattern of counteracting defectors (which is impossible directly via reward, but they also do not focus rewards in a way that clearly encourages the highest contributors on a regular basis). Instead, reward use is sporadic and seems opportunistic—activated when they themselves are cooperating and the environment is already cooperative.\n\nThey appear to treat the reward tool chiefly as a minor, situational adjustment rather than a central strategic lever. The overall low frequency and low intensity of reward giving, combined with a willingness to accept large reward inflows without reciprocation, suggests that norms of reciprocity and gratitude are weak for this player, at least under anonymous, non-identifiable reward conditions. Their default is to conserve their own payoff rather than invest in sustaining cooperation through costly positive sanctions."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a deliberately exploitative conditional contributor with a stark alternating pattern. They frequently give the minimum possible while others mostly contribute high amounts, capturing large private payoffs from others’ cooperation. Periodically, they switch to full contributions even when the group average has not collapsed, suggesting they are not a pure free-rider but rather an opportunistic mixed strategist.\n\nTheir contributions oscillate between minimum and maximum rather than gradually adjusting. This indicates low concern for smooth fairness norms and little effort to match others’ averages. The player shows no clear risk aversion about “wasting” contributions; they sometimes contribute fully even when others are already starting to reduce contributions and total returns are dropping. This pattern suggests that their main objective is not strict payoff maximization per round but a combination of: (a) exploiting cooperative phases, and (b) testing or maintaining their social standing with select players.\n\nTheir behavior is weakly conditional on others’ cooperation: they continue to free-ride even when the group remains highly cooperative, and they later contribute fully again when cooperation temporarily recovers. There is no sign that they try to sustain the group’s overall public-good level; rather, they use occasional high contributions as signals within a smaller reward-based exchange structure, not as a contribution norm enforcer.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThey are fully horizon-aware and do not exhibit standard “end-game defection” in a simple way. Instead of monotonically decreasing cooperation, they continue their alternating pattern of very low and very high contributions all the way through the final rounds.\n\nEven in the last few rounds, they sometimes contribute the minimum while most others contribute mid-to-high amounts, then abruptly switch back to maximum contributions despite no clear evidence that this benefits them materially in those specific rounds. This indicates they are not simply playing a final-round unraveling logic. They appear to continue using contributions and rewards as a coherent personal strategy to the end, rather than shifting into pure short-term exploitation at the horizon.\n\nOverall, end-game awareness is present (they know the round number), but their contribution behavior suggests a stable strategy that they maintain until the final round, rather than a horizon-driven change.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey are a moderately active but highly selective rewarder. They sometimes spend a nontrivial share of their payoff to grant rewards and sometimes refrain entirely, with no punishment option in the environment. Their reward behavior appears strategic rather than purely altruistic.\n\nPatterns indicate that they preferentially reward:\n- Players who contribute high or consistently cooperate.\n- Players who reward them.\nIn several phases, their own reward spending coincides with them also receiving substantial rewards, consistent with attempting to cultivate or reinforce mutual reward ties.\n\nThey do not seem to use rewards as a group-wide signal to sustain overall cooperation; when they spend, they target specific individuals rather than distributing small rewards broadly. At other times, they withhold rewards entirely while still taking advantage of others’ contributions by contributing the minimum. This suggests they view rewards as a tool for bilateral or small-cluster exchange, not as a general institution for group-level norm enforcement.\n\nThey appear willing to pay a real cost for reward, but only intermittently, suggesting they weigh costs against the likelihood of reciprocal benefits—either in direct rewards to themselves or in maintaining cooperative alliances. There is no evidence of spiteful or “anti-social” rewarding (e.g., rewarding low contributors); their observed reward use is consistent with reinforcing higher contributors and those who have previously favored them.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThey respond to being rewarded in ways consistent with reciprocal alliance-building. When they receive noticeable rewards, they are more likely, in nearby rounds, to both (a) contribute more and (b) spend on rewards themselves. This co-occurrence suggests gratitude signaling and an attempt to maintain beneficial ties rather than a purely self-centered free-ride strategy.\n\nHowever, this reciprocity is not universal or rigid. They do not mechanically reward every player who ever rewards them, nor do they permanently increase their contributions after being favored. Instead, they seem to use a flexible rule: reward and sometimes cooperate more toward those who appear to favor them or behave cooperatively, but retain freedom to revert to minimal contributions in later rounds even if alliances exist.\n\nThey are comfortable with asymmetric relationships: they can be rewarded substantially without immediately matching the rewarder’s level of generosity, and at other times they reward others when they themselves do not receive much in that specific round. This indicates that their reciprocity is probabilistic and strategic rather than strict tit-for-tat.\n\nOverall, they treat identifiable rewarders as valuable partners but not as individuals to whom they owe unconditional loyalty; reciprocity is present but moderated by their underlying opportunism.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey pay attention to others’ contributions, reward spending, and payoffs, but they do not appear to respond strongly to group-level outcomes. High group contributions and large total multipliers are often met with their own minimal contribution, indicating they are willing to exploit cooperative states instead of reinforcing them. They show little concern for the fact that some players repeatedly incur large reward costs and end rounds with low payoffs; they do not move to support or imitate these “over-generous” players.\n\nTheir main adjustments seem keyed to:\n- Who is consistently contributing high while not obviously exploiting rewards.\n- Who is rewarding them or their high-contributing peers.\n\nWhen others’ contributions fall and group payoffs decline, they often continue to free-ride rather than stepping up their own contributions to stabilize the group. At other times, they inject a burst of high contribution and some reward spending even when outcomes are already deteriorating, suggesting a focus on maintaining select bilateral relationships rather than rescuing the public good.\n\nThey display tolerance for inequality in payoffs: they routinely end rounds with higher payoffs than many cooperators when free-riding, and they do not compensate for this through extra reward giving. Conversely, when they themselves end with lower payoffs in contribution-heavy, reward-heavy rounds, they do not appear to shift toward consistent defection only; they continue to use a mixed approach. This points to a player who is outcome-aware but not equality-seeking, prioritizing selective reciprocity and personal advantage over collective efficiency or fairness."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is primarily a strategic free-rider with occasional full cooperation when it appears individually safe or when they are experimenting. They face a binary choice each round and overwhelmingly choose not to contribute. They do fully contribute only in a small minority of rounds, and those cooperative moves do not persist; they revert back to keeping their entire endowment. Their behavior suggests they understand that, given the group’s multiplier, not contributing is individually profitable when others are willing to contribute.\n\nTheir contribution pattern is piecewise stable: they often maintain the same choice across several consecutive rounds rather than switching erratically. This indicates a basic strategy rather than random play. When others contribute reliably, they mostly exploit that by free-riding, only occasionally joining in. There is no evidence that they follow a fairness norm like “match others’ average” or “contribute whenever others do”; they clearly tolerate benefiting from others’ contributions while not sharing the cost.\n\nRisk tolerance in contributions appears low to moderate: they do not repeatedly “test” high cooperation nor do they sacrifice much payoff to try to build a fully cooperative norm. When they do contribute fully, it seems more like isolated probes or short-lived shifts than a sustained attempt to change the group dynamic. They show no clear sensitivity to marginal changes in others’ contributions: cooperative bursts from others do not systematically induce them to cooperate in return. Overall, their baseline is non-contribution, with cooperation as a temporary deviation rather than a guiding principle.\n\n<REWARD>\nThis player almost never spends on rewards, even though rewards are individually cost-neutral in this setting. Across most of the game, they consistently choose not to reward anyone, regardless of how much others contribute. This suggests that even when rewarding is not costly in net payoff terms, they are reluctant to give up control over their own coins or to take on the active role of “enforcer” or “encourager.” They appear payoff-focused in the narrow sense of keeping their own coins in hand rather than using them to shape others’ behavior.\n\nOnly once do they engage in substantial rewarding, and that occurs at a moment when they themselves are cooperating. On that occasion, they invest nontrivially in rewards while contributing fully. This indicates that they can, in principle, use rewards to reinforce cooperation, but they do so rarely and only when already in a cooperative mindset. The timing suggests that their motive may be strategic reinforcement (trying to sustain or reward a cooperative subgroup) rather than pure altruistic generosity, but this is uncertain.\n\nThey show no evidence of using small, frequent rewards as a running signal of approval or gratitude to consistent cooperators. They also do not use rewards as a tool to compensate those who previously rewarded them; their large reward action is not a direct tit-for-tat to the specific players who had rewarded them earlier, at least not in a clearly traceable way from the transcript. Overall, their default is to withhold rewards, even from high contributors, and to treat the reward mechanism as something to be activated only under special circumstances.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nWhen others reward this player, there is no clear pattern of reciprocal reward directed back at those individuals, and no consistent increase in their own contributions that could be interpreted as sustained gratitude-based cooperation. After being rewarded, they do not reliably become more cooperative in the subsequent rounds, nor do they begin rewarding in a systematic way. At best, there is one episode later in the game where they both contribute and reward, but it is not clearly targeted reciprocation toward identified past rewarders; it looks more like a standalone cooperative-rewarding episode rather than a stable alliance response.\n\nThey therefore do not appear to build alliances or conditional partnerships based on being rewarded. Identification of rewarders does not, in observable behavior, lead them to single those players out for payback rewards or consistent mutual support. Any internal feeling of gratitude is behaviorally weak or absent: their choices show that being rewarded does not strongly reshape their strategy.\n\nOverall, their response profile is: being rewarded has limited and short-lived impact on their actions. They are willing to accept rewards without reliably adjusting their behavior in favor of the rewarder. They act more like an opportunistic recipient than a reciprocity-driven partner, and they do not seem to treat the reward channel as the basis for long-term coalition-building or norm enforcement."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a mixed, conditional contributor who alternates between full cooperation and full free-riding, rather than settling into a single stable pattern. They are clearly willing to contribute the entire endowment and do so repeatedly, which rules out a pure selfish or purely risk-averse type. At the same time, they also repeatedly choose not to contribute even when others are contributing, so they are not a strict unconditional cooperator either.\n\nTheir cooperation appears loosely conditional on the surrounding contribution climate and on their own recent experience, but the condition is not rigid: they sometimes cooperate when others are mostly defecting and sometimes defect when at least one or two others cooperate. This suggests they are not a strict “tit-for-tat” or pure matching type, but rather someone who is experimenting between cooperative and exploitative options to see which pattern yields better returns.\n\nThey seem comfortable with payoff risk: they contribute in situations where it is already evident that at least some group members contribute zero, so they do not require unanimous cooperation before pitching in. They also appear to tolerate inequality to their own disadvantage: they keep contributing after experiencing being the only or one of the few contributors, and they do not systematically withdraw cooperation in all such cases.\n\nNormatively, they seem to hold a weak fairness norm in favor of higher contributions: they repeatedly match or exceed the highest cooperative standard that exists in the group, but they do not maintain that standard consistently or enforce it through their own behavior when others fall short. The resulting pattern is a “wobbly cooperator–opportunist”: willing to support a cooperative regime, but not committed enough to sacrifice payoffs steadily or to fully discipline free-riding through their own choices.\n\nTheir contribution choices do not show clear end-game unraveling; they continue to contribute their full endowment even after many rounds have passed. Since they cannot see how many rounds remain, this persistence is consistent with some present-focused experimentation rather than forward-looking strategic end-game defection.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey almost never spend on reward, despite multiple opportunities and despite being on the receiving end of rewards more than once. The single instance of rewarding behavior is an exception rather than a pattern, which indicates that prosocial reinforcement is not a central part of their strategy.\n\nWhen they do reward, it appears targeted at someone who is clearly cooperating relative to others, suggesting that, in principle, they recognize and are willing to positively reinforce above-baseline cooperation. However, the fact that this rewarding action does not repeat later, even when similarly cooperative peers are present, suggests that the earlier reward is either a one-time experiment with the mechanism or a transient impulse rather than a stable preference.\n\nThe cost and benefit of reward are symmetric in this environment, so the material calculus is neutral: not rewarding does not directly improve their payoff relative to rewarding, except to avoid the transaction altogether. Their near-complete avoidance of reward therefore looks more like a preference to minimize effort or complexity, or a belief that reward has little impact on others’ future behavior, than like a finely tuned payoff-maximization response to the cost structure.\n\nThey do not use reward as a systematic tool to shape group norms, build alliances, or express ongoing gratitude. There is no evidence of reward-based reciprocity loops (rewarding those who rewarded them or systematically rewarding loyal cooperators). Overall, their reward behavior is best characterized as “low-engagement, occasional, and non-strategic.”\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nWhen they receive rewards, they continue to contribute at high levels in many subsequent decisions, but the pattern of contributions around rewarded episodes does not clearly differ from their overall mixed contribution strategy. This makes it hard to infer strong reward responsiveness: they neither sharply increase nor clearly decrease cooperation immediately in response to being rewarded. Thus, their behavioral reaction to being rewarded is ambiguous and likely weak.\n\nThey do not visibly reciprocate toward identifiable rewarders via the reward mechanism itself: there is no consistent pattern of sending rewards back to those who previously rewarded them, nor of preferentially rewarding particular high-contribution partners over time. This suggests that, in this setting, they do not treat reward as a vehicle for building bilateral alliances or for symbolic reciprocity.\n\nTheir contributions do remain generally compatible with cooperation in environments where other players are offering at least some cooperation. Being rewarded does not trigger retaliation, defensiveness, or withdrawal; at minimum, they tolerate being singled out with rewards and continue to play in a way that can benefit the group. That said, because they also continue to defect in some later periods after having been rewarded, any reciprocity norm they hold appears weak or overshadowed by their own payoff experimentation and opportunistic swings between cooperation and free-riding.\n\nIn terms of social style, they come across as relatively detached: they acknowledge rewards passively through continued participation in the public good but do not actively “answer” them through the available reward channel. Their primary lever for responding to the social environment seems to be whether they themselves contribute or not, rather than how they use the reward system. Overall, their response to identifiable rewarders is muted, with low-confidence evidence of only mild, non-targeted reinforcement of cooperative norms."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a conditional, payoff-sensitive contributor who mixes cooperation and free-riding rather than committing to a single mode. They are clearly willing to contribute fully to the public good at many points, but they also repeatedly choose to contribute nothing even when others continue to contribute. Their pattern shows that they do not follow a simple “always cooperate” norm; instead, they appear to compare the private payoff from free-riding against the shared payoff from joint contribution and are willing to exploit cooperative others when it is lucrative.\n\nTheir contribution behavior is moderately volatile: they switch several times between full contribution and zero contribution across the game instead of settling quickly into a single stable choice. However, they are not random: stretches of sustained full contribution alternate with stretches of sustained free-riding, suggesting they update based on perceived trends in the group or on recent payoff experiences rather than round-by-round emotional reactions.\n\nThey do not enforce strict fairness norms. They continue to contribute in the presence of at least one persistent free-rider and do not systematically withdraw cooperation in direct proportion to others’ selfishness. At the same time, they also free-ride even when multiple others are cooperating, indicating that “if others are fair, I must also be fair” is not a binding rule for them. Instead, their fairness concern is either weak or consistently overridden by payoff considerations.\n\nRisk tolerance appears moderate. They are willing to be the only or one of very few contributors in some rounds, exposing themselves to the risk of low redistribution when others do not join. Yet they also protect themselves at times by switching to free-riding, especially after experiencing scenarios in which contributing yields relatively poor private payoffs compared to free-riding under similar group behavior. This pattern suggests a player who recognizes the strategic risk of unilateral cooperation and is willing to take it sometimes, but not in a rigid or idealistic way.\n\nOverall, their contribution “type” is a flexible, opportunistic cooperator: inclined to cooperate when it seems worthwhile or when others are joining in, but ready to revert to self-interested free-riding to secure high individual payoffs and to avoid bearing the cost of sustaining cooperation alone.\n\n<REWARD>\nThe player never spends any resources on rewarding others, despite having multiple opportunities and despite being paired with clear, observable cooperative behavior from specific group members. This consistent absence of reward behavior suggests that they either assign negligible value to rewarding as an instrument for sustaining cooperation or they strictly prioritize keeping their own payoff over any attempt to shape others’ behavior through positive incentives.\n\nThey do receive rewards from others at several points, but this does not induce them to start rewarding anyone in return. There is no evidence that receiving rewards triggers gratitude-based reciprocation in the reward channel. They do not engage in “strategic reinforcement” of particular partners either; for example, they never select a consistently high-contributing partner to encourage with rewards, even when that partner’s behavior is easily identifiable and potentially valuable to sustain.\n\nGiven that the cost and benefit of reward are symmetric here, their complete abstention from rewarding likely reflects a belief that reward is either ineffective, not worth the effort, or simply dominated by focusing on one’s own contributions and free-riding decisions. They may also view reward as redundant in an environment where contributions are already visible and where they can respond directly by adjusting their own contributions rather than by spending on side-payments.\n\nIn sum, they are a non-rewarder: they do not use the reward option for altruistic, reciprocal, or strategic reasons, and they treat reward as an unnecessary or inefficient instrument in this setting.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nWhen others reward them, the player does not mirror that behavior through direct rewarding, but they do at times change their contribution behavior in ways that are compatible with some degree of responsiveness. After receiving a reward, they sometimes move from free-riding to contributing, or they maintain a cooperative stance for a while. However, they also later revert to free-riding even after having been rewarded multiple times, indicating that any positive response to being rewarded is partial and unstable.\n\nThey do not single out identifiable rewarders for special treatment through contributions. Because all players’ contributions are public, it is possible in principle for them to form an “alliance” with those who both contribute and reward them. Yet their subsequent behavior toward such partners remains mixed: they sometimes cooperate alongside cooperative others, and sometimes exploit them by free-riding, even when those same partners have previously rewarded them. There is no visible pattern of targeted reciprocity toward specific rewarders.\n\nThis suggests that their primary response to being rewarded is not gratitude or alliance-building but, at most, a weak and temporary adjustment in overall cooperation level that is dominated by payoff considerations and by their reading of the wider group pattern. They appear to treat being rewarded as a pleasant but non-binding signal: it may briefly coincide with higher contributions, but it does not anchor long-term loyalty or create a robust reciprocal bond with the rewarder."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a low, volatile contributor who occasionally makes brief cooperative surges. Across the game, their typical contribution level is small relative to the endowment and to the group, with multiple minimal or zero contributions interspersed with a few full or high contributions. They do not follow a simple monotonic pattern (neither steady decay nor steady increase); instead, they alternate between free-riding and sizable giving, suggesting experimentation or opportunistic adjustment rather than a fixed norm.\n\nTheir behavior is conditionally responsive to others’ cooperation. After observing very high average contributions and generous use of rewards in the group, they sometimes jump to high contributions, but they do not maintain that level once they have confirmed that they can earn strong payoffs while contributing little. The pattern suggests they understand that contributing little while others give a lot is profitable and are willing to exploit that situation. At the same time, occasional high contributions indicate they are not purely selfish in a static sense; they sometimes act as if testing or reinforcing a cooperative regime, then revert when high cooperation appears stable without their full participation.\n\nThey do not appear to follow a strict fairness norm. They are willing to contribute far less than heavy contributors while still accepting the shared returns from the public pool, and they show no consistent effort to match or proportionally track others’ contributions. This implies limited concern for contribution equality, at least when it trades off with their own earnings.\n\nRisk tolerance in contribution choices appears moderate. They are willing at times to risk the cost of full contribution in a large group with mixed behavior, but because they quickly revert to small contributions even when cooperation is strong, the default seems to be a cautious, payoff-protecting stance: they mostly keep private coins safe and only occasionally stake them on the public good.\n\n<REWARD>\nThis player is a light, selective rewarder who uses rewards sparingly and with no clear pattern of systematic reinforcement. In most rounds, they do not spend anything on rewards. When they do spend, it is always at the minimum nonzero level available and directed at a very small number of recipients. This reveals a reluctance to bear substantial personal cost for shaping others’ behavior.\n\nThey appear more willing to reward when group cooperation is already high or rising and when they themselves have contributed at least something. In those situations, they sometimes spend a bit to reward, which is consistent with a weak form of conditional cooperation: they are willing to pay slightly to acknowledge or support a cooperative environment but not to drive it from scratch. The small, infrequent expenditures suggest they view reward primarily as a minor tweak rather than a central strategic tool.\n\nThere is no consistent evidence that they target either extreme cooperators or specific individuals over time; given anonymity of rewarders, any such targeting cannot be inferred with confidence. Whether they use reward to express gratitude, to encourage particular partners, or simply to “do a small good” is unknown. Overall, they value their own payoff more than the potential future gains from strategic, large-scale rewarding.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThis player closely observes that others frequently contribute much more and often engage in very heavy rewarding, sometimes to the point of significantly lowering their own payoffs. Their own behavior indicates that they do not imitate these extremes. Instead, they continue to play in a comparatively self-protective, low-cost way even when others incur large expenses on rewards.\n\nThey do not ramp up contributions or reward spending in response to other players sacrificing a lot for the group, suggesting limited reciprocity toward high-cost cooperators. At the same time, they also do not retaliate against low contributors (punishment is unavailable) nor respond with increased contributions when apparent “free-riders” are rewarded by others. They simply maintain or return to their preferred low-contribution, low-reward pattern after brief experiments with higher giving.\n\nThis points to a mindset where others’ outcomes serve more as background information than as strong behavioral triggers. They notice the environment is generally cooperative and that some players are willing to spend heavily on rewarding, but they treat this mainly as an opportunity to secure good payoffs with modest personal sacrifice. Their adaptation over time reflects learning about what the group tolerates and what yields high earnings for them, rather than a strong normative response to fairness, altruistic sacrifice, or gratitude. Their social style thus appears pragmatic, mildly conditional, and only weakly influenced by others’ costs or extreme generosity."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a “stubborn moderate cooperator.” They almost always contribute the same intermediate amount, with only one brief deviation downward and one brief deviation upward. Their default is to give a consistent, non-maximal share that is below what many others give but still far from free-riding. They do not systematically adjust contributions in response to changes in others’ average behavior, even when they are repeatedly the unique low contributor among mostly high contributors, and even when they are singled out by punishment. This suggests they treat their chosen level as a personal fairness norm or comfortable compromise between self-interest and group benefit, rather than using a flexible, conditional cooperation strategy. They show low reactive volatility: feedback from others (via punishment, rewards to others, or shifts in group contributions) does not produce sustained upward or downward trends in their own giving. Their risk tolerance appears moderate: they are willing to undercontribute relative to others despite visibility and sanction risk, but they also avoid extreme free-riding that might trigger harsher responses or collapse group cooperation.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey never use punishment, despite having multiple opportunities and a clear pattern that one specific partner targets them with costly sanctions. This indicates a very high threshold for imposing costs on others and a strong reluctance to spend personal resources for either deterrence or retaliation. Their behavior does not show targeted or proportional sanctions toward lower contributors, nor retaliation against someone who persistently punishes them. From this, it is reasonable to infer that they either (a) view punishment as inefficient or not worth the cost, (b) are conflict-averse and prefer not to escalate, or (c) are focused on maximizing own payoff without engaging in norm enforcement. Because they themselves are consistently under the group’s contribution norm, it is also plausible that they recognize their own vulnerability and avoid a punishment “war”; however, this is uncertain. Overall, they function as a non-enforcer type: they free-ride somewhat on the norm-enforcement efforts of others without joining those efforts.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nWhen another player repeatedly punishes them, they do not retaliate, they do not significantly increase their contribution to align with the punisher’s implicit demand, and they do not shift into a punitive stance toward anyone else. Their contribution pattern remains essentially stable after being sanctioned multiple times, including instances where the sanction is substantial. This indicates that punishment does not successfully coerce them into higher cooperation and does not trigger counter-punishment. They appear to “absorb” the punishment and continue with their own strategy, implying either a strong commitment to their chosen contribution level, indifference to others’ attempts to control their behavior, or uncertainty about how to interpret the sanction. They exhibit behavioral forgiveness or at least non-retaliation: even persistent, costly punishment aimed at them does not change their treatment of the punisher relative to other group members.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey never use rewards, even though several others actively reward high contributors. They do not reciprocate those prosocial signals, and they do not selectively reinforce any partner’s behavior. This suggests that they either place low value on norm-reinforcement via positive incentives, consider the reward mechanism inefficient for their own payoff, or are generally uninterested in actively shaping others’ behavior. The absence of rewarding despite clear evidence that others employ it implies they do not try to join the “prosocial coalition” that uses rewards to sustain high cooperation. Their stance is thus passive with respect to positive incentives: they benefit from a high-contribution environment that others help sustain, but they do not invest in maintaining it.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThey never receive rewards from others in this game, so their direct response to being rewarded is unknown. Because they consistently refrain from using reward on anyone, including players who are frequently rewarding others, it is uncertain whether they would respond with reciprocal reward or higher contributions if they ever were rewarded. There is no behavioral evidence that they attempt to form alliances with rewarders or distinguish rewarders from non-rewarders in their own actions.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey observe a group where several players often contribute close to the maximum and sometimes spend on rewards, while one player regularly devotes substantial resources to punishing them. Despite this, they do not visibly condition their behavior on others’ payoffs, spending, or treatment of them. High contributors’ relatively strong earnings and prosocial signaling do not induce them to match those contribution levels, and the punisher’s lower payoffs (due to punishment costs) do not induce them to exploit that player further or adjust contributions downward. They appear largely indifferent, behaviorally, to whether others are sacrificing for the group (via high contribution or reward) or sacrificing to enforce norms (via punishment). This points to a type that monitors the environment enough to see that cooperation is stable and beneficial, and then “locks in” a personally satisfactory contribution that exploits some of the surplus generated by others’ generosity while avoiding extreme opportunism. Their social style is quiet and self-contained: they neither coordinate with prosocial players nor escalate conflict with punishers, and they maintain their own rule-of-thumb strategy regardless of others’ detailed outcomes."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a highly flexible conditional cooperator–defector who alternates between full free-riding and high contributions rather than settling into a stable pattern. They are clearly aware that others tend to contribute generously and repeatedly face situations where their own contribution is far below the group average, but they do not consistently adjust upward to match that norm. Instead, they sometimes jump to very high contributions, including full or near-full provision, and at other times revert to zero even when others remain generous.\n\nThey does not follow a simple “match-the-average” rule. They contributes nothing in many periods when others are substantially above them, yet in other periods voluntarily moves to the cooperative side, even when others are not unusually generous. This suggests that their decisions are not purely driven by fairness or reciprocity norms. Rather, they appears to be experimenting with different contribution levels or opportunistically choosing between free-riding and cooperating based on short-term payoffs and mood/heuristics rather than a fixed rule.\n\nOver the game, they show no monotonic cooperation decay or simple “end-game defect” pattern. High contributions are scattered throughout the interaction, including late in the horizon, and low contributions are also scattered, including in the middle and late game. This irregularity suggests either low concern with norm consistency, or a player who continually weighs immediate private gain against the public return on a round-by-round basis, without committing to a stable identity as “cooperator” or “defector.”\n\nTheir behavior indicates tolerance for the risk of negative social response: they repeatedly free-ride in cooperative environments where sanctioning is possible, and they continue to do so even after being punished more than once. They appears comfortable exploiting the group when it seems lucrative, and only sometimes chooses to “do their part,” without evidence of a strong guilt or fairness-driven correction.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThe player is horizon-aware in the minimal sense that they know the game length, but there is no clear signature of a sharp end-game collapse. They alternates between high and zero contributions both before and within the final third of the game. In the last several periods, they continues to mix between full free-riding and substantial contributions, including near the final round, instead of shifting to a pure defection strategy.\n\nThis pattern suggests they does not treat the end of the game as a decisive signal to abandon cooperation. Instead, they maintains the same opportunistic, mixed strategy: sometimes cooperating substantially, sometimes free-riding, with no visible tightening toward one extreme linked specifically to the horizon. Any end-game adjustment in their beliefs or incentives is low-confidence/unknown from the transcript; the observable pattern is continued volatility rather than systematic decay or escalation.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThe player uses punishment very sparingly and is not a consistent enforcer. Across the entire interaction, they punishes only in a tiny minority of opportunities, and even then at low intensity. This selective use suggests that they is not motivated by a strong norm-enforcement or altruistic-punishment motive.\n\nGiven that others routinely contribute more than they do, most available targets, when they punish, are not extreme free-riders relative to the group. From this, it is difficult to infer a clear, principled trigger such as “punish those far below the average” or “punish those below my own contribution,” since their own contribution is often at the minimum. It is more plausible that when they do punish, it is either a reaction to having been punished themselves (retaliation) or an ad hoc attempt to influence behavior without a stable fairness rule. However, without seeing the distribution of incoming punishments by target, this remains low-confidence.\n\nTheir punishment intensity is modest rather than maximal. They is willing to spend a nontrivial but small amount to harm another player; they does not appear to invest heavily in deterrence. This indicates that they places more value on preserving their own payoff than on strongly shaping the group’s norms through costly sanctions.\n\nOverall, they is best characterized as a reluctant or instrumental punisher: mostly refraining from punishment, occasionally using it, but not as a central part of their strategy.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nThe player is punished multiple times when free-riding, including in settings where others are cooperating substantially. Despite this, they does not pivot to a stable, higher-contribution strategy. After punishment, they sometimes increase their contribution dramatically in subsequent periods, but they also sometimes continue to contribute nothing after punishments or revert to zero following periods of cooperation. This mixture suggests that punishment does not reliably elicit long-term compliance.\n\nBecause the transcript does not show who punished them, their direct response to specific identifiable punishers is unknown. There is no clear evidence of targeted retaliation: their very rare use of punishment does not obviously track prior low contributions by particular peers, and there is no consistent pattern of them punishing right after being punished. Therefore, their tendency toward revenge against specific punishers is unknown/low-confidence.\n\nAt the aggregate level, they appears tolerant of being sanctioned. They is willing to continue free-riding after having experienced costly deductions, which implies either a relatively low sensitivity to social disapproval or a belief that the expected private gain from free-riding still outweighs the expected cost of further sanctions. Their behavior is consistent with a player who views punishment more as an occasional cost of doing business than as a binding social signal that must be heeded.\n\nIn interpersonal terms, they behaves more as a self-focused, payoff-driven participant than a responsive partner trying to repair their standing with the group or with particular punishers. Their overall style in the face of sanctions is neither clearly conciliatory nor clearly vindictive; it is best characterized as instrumentally indifferent, with limited and inconsistent adjustment."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a short-lived conditional cooperator who quickly shifts into a self-regarding, opportunistic free-rider. They initially match or slightly exceed the apparent cooperative norm, indicating some willingness to support group efficiency when uncertain about others. Once they experience that they can secure high payoffs without contributing, they reliably choose not to contribute and do not switch back to cooperation. Their behavior suggests they track the group’s average contributions and recognize that others are sustaining the public good, but they choose to exploit this rather than reciprocate. They show no clear concern for fairness in payoff distribution; they tolerate benefiting from others’ contributions while not contributing themselves. Risk tolerance appears moderate: they are willing to experiment once with full contribution and then avoid the “risk” of unreciprocated cooperation in subsequent decisions.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThis player is highly willing to use costly punishment and does so in a way that is not clearly aligned with enforcing contribution norms or maximizing efficiency. They punish even while personally free-riding, which contradicts a straightforward “moralistic enforcer” type. Targets include high contributors, and there is no consistent link between a peer’s contribution level and being punished. This pattern suggests that punishment is not primarily deterrence-based or norm-enforcing. The player’s selectivity seems idiosyncratic or opaque: they single out a small subset of players without a clear behavioral difference from others, indicating possible use of punishment as expression of frustration, random experimentation with the mechanism, or a low-information attempt to influence future behavior. They are willing to incur sizeable costs for punishment, showing relatively low aversion to payoff loss when using sanctioning tools, but they abandon punishment later, hinting at some updating (e.g., concluding it is ineffective or too costly). Overall motives are ambiguous; there is no consistent evidence for retaliation, as we cannot see who punished them, and no clear pattern of targeted deterrence.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nUnknown. The transcript shows that the player is punished, but it does not identify which peers imposed the sanctions or how this player adjusts toward specific punishers. There is no visible shift toward higher cooperation after being punished, nor any detectable pattern of counter-punishing particular individuals, but this absence of evidence cannot distinguish between forgiveness, retaliation, or indifference. Compliance with punishers’ presumed norms is not observed; however, because identity links between punishers and deductions are not provided in the data, the player’s interpersonal response style toward identified punishers remains of low-inference confidence.\n\n<REWARD>\nThis player consistently avoids using the reward option, even when others contribute highly and could be reinforced. Their behavior indicates a strong reluctance to spend on positive incentives, especially given the relatively poor cost-effectiveness of reward compared to punishment. They do not attempt to build goodwill, signal gratitude, or encourage cooperation via rewards. This suggests that, when they do engage with social tools, they favor negative over positive sanctions. It is unclear whether they conceptually value rewarding cooperators but reject it on cost grounds, or simply do not consider positive reinforcement as part of their strategic toolkit; the observable pattern is that they allocate nothing to rewards under any condition.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nUnknown. The player never receives any rewards in the available data, so their reactions to being rewarded, including potential reciprocity, alliance building, or increased cooperation, cannot be inferred."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a mostly cooperative, mildly opportunistic contributor who appears sensitive to the surrounding norm. They generally align with a high-contribution standard, joining the majority in providing the full endowment to the public good when they see that many others do so. Their pattern suggests a baseline preference to contribute rather than free-ride, but this is not absolute: they are willing to withhold contributions when defection is visibly common and/or when they have recently been treated negatively by others.\n\nThey show conditional cooperation: their decision to contribute seems linked to what they infer about the group’s behavior and attitude toward them. When they feel aligned with the group and not targeted, they cooperate fully. When they feel misaligned—e.g., after being singled out for negative treatment despite not behaving worse than others—they are willing to deviate and keep their endowment. This indicates concern for fairness and reciprocity rather than pure profit maximization or unconditional altruism.\n\nStability is moderate: they do not oscillate randomly, but they do adjust behavior in response to the social environment. They seem willing to bear personal cost to maintain a cooperative norm as long as they perceive the group as fair and non-hostile. Risk tolerance appears moderate as well: they accept exposure to exploitation (by free-riders or punishers) but will test a more self-interested response once that exploitation is salient. They do not, however, escalate into sustained defection; instead, they return to cooperation, implying a default leaning toward prosociality with some guardedness.\n\nOverall, they fit a “conditional cooperator with fairness sensitivity” type: they prefer high contributions, but that preference is contingent on being treated reasonably by others.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThis player entirely abstains from using costly punishment, even when clear free-riders or surprising punishers are present. They do not target low contributors, nor do they respond punitively to those who harmed them. This absence of punishment is consistent and not obviously driven by a lack of opportunity.\n\nTheir non-use of punishment suggests several tendencies:\n- Low inclination toward retaliation, even when directly harmed.\n- Reluctance to invest resources in norm enforcement, despite having visible free-riders.\n- A likely perception that punishment is either too costly, too aggressive, or not worth the effort in this environment.\n\nThey do not engage in selective “moralistic punishment” of defectors, nor in revenge toward whoever imposed costs on them. This hints at either a more tolerant or conflict-avoidant style, or a strategic calculation that punishing under uncertainty (not knowing how many rounds remain, nor seeing others’ payoffs) is inefficient.\n\nRegarding motives, there is no evidence of either deterrence- or retaliation-based punishment: they never use the tool, even when both could be justified from a self- or group-protective perspective. This aligns them with a “non-punishing cooperator” profile—willing to contribute, but not to bear additional cost to sanction others.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nThey experience a substantial deduction at one point, clearly attributable to someone using the punishment mechanism against them, but they do not respond with direct retaliation via punishment. Instead, their next observed response is a temporary shift toward non-contribution. This reveals several things:\n\n- They register punishment and adjust behavior, but the adjustment targets their own contribution rather than the punisher.\n- Their reaction mixes emotional or fairness-related response with strategic adaptation: when punished despite not behaving worse than many peers, they briefly withhold cooperation, as if to withdraw goodwill from a group that appears hostile or unfair.\n- They do not appear vengeful against specific individuals, despite punishers being identifiable. This suggests either self-control, reluctance to escalate conflict, or a focus on their own behavior rather than targeting others.\n\nForgiveness is partial: they do not retaliate, and they ultimately resume cooperative contributions, indicating they do not hold a lasting grudge strong enough to cement long-term defection. However, the temporary defection shows they are not fully compliant either; they are willing to “push back” against perceived unfair treatment by lowering their own contributions.\n\nIn sum, their response to being punished is non-retaliatory but not submissive: they briefly reduce cooperation to signal or act on their discontent, then revert to their cooperative baseline.\n\n<REWARD>\nThe player has access to a reward mechanism and receives rewards themselves, yet never uses rewards on others. This consistent inaction suggests a reluctance to spend personal resources to positively reinforce even clear high contributors.\n\nPossible interpretations, all somewhat speculative:\n- They may see reward as too inefficient or costly, given the conversion rate.\n- They may believe that cooperation is already sufficiently established and doesn’t need additional reinforcement.\n- They may be more self-focused in the use of side mechanisms, reserving resources rather than investing in others’ payoffs.\n\nWhat is clearer is that they are not a “rewarding cooperator” type: they contribute to the public good but do not supplement that with positive incentives. This differentiates them from “strong reciprocators” who both cooperate and actively reward cooperators. Their stance is more minimal: they cooperate directly but do not pay extra for social engineering.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThey are rewarded at least twice and can clearly see that someone chose to benefit them, yet they offer no return reward. They also do not change their use of the reward mechanism after being rewarded; it remains inactive. Their contribution behavior following rewards is cooperative, but this was already characteristic of them except during the period following punishment.\n\nThis indicates:\n- They do not engage in explicit reciprocity via reward tools, even when a clear opportunity for alliance-building or gratitude signaling exists.\n- Their gratitude, if present, is not expressed through costly reward; instead, their cooperative contribution pattern continues more or less as before.\n- They do not appear to adopt a targeted “you rewarded me, I’ll reward you” exchange strategy in this environment.\n\nThus, their response to being rewarded is passive: they accept the benefit, maintain or resume cooperative contributions, but do not invest in reinforcing or reciprocating toward the rewarder specifically. This places them in a type that values cooperation and is somewhat responsive to group treatment in their own contribution decisions, but that largely ignores the second-order tools of interpersonal sanctioning and rewarding."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is an initially cooperative but quickly conditional contributor who shifts to free-riding after experiencing targeted punishment. They begin by fully investing in the public good when others are mostly cooperative, indicating a baseline willingness to act pro-socially even when doing so is personally costly. They later switch to non-contribution despite others continuing to contribute at high rates, suggesting that their cooperation is fragile and strongly contingent on how they are treated rather than on group norms alone. The switch away from contributing follows being punished once, indicating that they interpret punishment as a negative social signal or injustice rather than as a norm-enforcing cue, and they respond by withdrawing cooperation. Their choices do not aim to fine-tune contributions based on subtle gradations of others’ behavior; instead, they display a coarse, state-like pattern (all-in cooperation vs full defection). This pattern points to a player who values fairness and respect; when they feel unfairly targeted, they are willing to accept substantial efficiency losses to stop contributing. Risk tolerance appears moderate: they initially “risk” cooperating in a mixed environment but do not persist in cooperative behavior after a salient negative interaction.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThis player never uses costly punishment, even in the presence of clear free-riders and even after being punished themselves. This suggests a strong reluctance to engage in negative sanctioning and possibly an aversion to harming others, including those who behave selfishly. They do not display retaliatory behavior: when they become a target of punishment, they refrain from punishing the likely punisher or any group members. This is consistent with a non-retaliatory, non-aggressive style. Because they do not punish low contributors, they also do not appear focused on using punishment as a cooperative enforcement tool. Overall, they behave as a non-punisher type: they absorb costs from others’ behavior (including punishment directed at them) without responding in kind, and they appear unwilling to incur costs solely to deter or discipline others.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nWhen punished, this player does not retaliate or selectively target the likely punisher; instead, they respond by withdrawing cooperation in subsequent decisions. They accept the deduction without counter-punishing, indicating low inclination toward direct revenge, but they adjust their own contribution behavior in a way that reduces their vulnerability and their generosity toward the group. This suggests that they interpret being punished as a signal that the social environment is hostile or unfair and that further cooperation is not “deserved.” Their response is thus indirect: they do not punish the punisher, but they cease providing the cooperative benefit that helped others. They do not use rewards afterward either, which reinforces the interpretation that punishment shifts them into a more self-protective, disengaged stance. Their willingness to forgive in the sense of “not striking back” coexists with a low tolerance for perceived mistreatment in the sense of “not continuing to help.”\n\n<REWARD>\nThis player willingly spends on rewards for others when they themselves are contributing. They selectively reward high contributors, not all of them, implying that they use rewards as a targeted acknowledgment rather than a blanket bonus to every cooperator. Their choices show sensitivity to others’ cooperative behavior: they direct rewards to players who consistently invest, indicating an effort to reinforce pro-social behavior and to signal appreciation. The player accepts the relatively unfavorable payoff efficiency of the reward mechanism, suggesting that they value social signaling and reciprocity norms over pure payoff-maximization when they are in a cooperative mindset. However, once they shift to non-contribution after being punished, they stop rewarding altogether, even though many others remain cooperative. This pattern implies that their willingness to reward is conditional on feeling part of a fair, respectful cooperative context; when that feeling is disrupted, they disengage from positive sanctioning as well.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThis player is rewarded by others but shows no observable change in their own sanctioning patterns toward those rewarders or the group afterward, beyond what is already described in their contribution and reward behaviors. They do not begin “reciprocal rewarding” of specific individuals in response to having been rewarded, at least not in a clearly traceable pattern; instead, their reward behavior remains focused on high contributors in general. This suggests that while they likely appreciate being rewarded (inferred from their initial willingness to reward others in similar positions), their behavior is guided more by principled views about contribution and fairness than by dyadic alliance-building with particular rewarders. When they later withdraw from cooperation after punishment, they also do not show targeted positive reciprocity toward any prior rewarders. Overall, they display limited direct reciprocity toward identified rewarders and appear more norm- and fairness-driven than relationship-driven in their sanction responses."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a strategically alternating contributor who experiments between full cooperation and free riding. Early on, they are willing to contribute the full endowment, indicating they recognize the efficiency of the public good and are not intrinsically opposed to cooperation. After observing that others also give high amounts but that they personally get targeted with punishment even when contributing, they test the payoff structure by switching abruptly to zero contributions. They then maintain a pattern of mostly free riding, occasionally reverting to full or partial contributions. Their choices suggest they care about maximizing personal payoff while probing how much defection they can get away with under punishment. Contribution levels do not strictly track others’ exact averages, but the player seems responsive to the general environment: they cooperate when group contributions remain high and defect when they can still benefit from others’ high giving. Partial giving later in the game suggests some residual willingness to participate, but they do not appear guided by strong fairness norms such as “match the group average”; instead, they test extremes (all or nothing) more than nuanced conditionals. Risk tolerance appears moderate: they are willing to take the reputational and material risk of repeatedly free riding despite predictable punishment, which indicates low sensitivity to social disapproval and a focus on exploring profitable deviations.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThe player shows awareness of the finite horizon but does not follow a simple monotonic end-game decay from early cooperation to late defection. Instead, their pattern is already mixed mid-game, and the final rounds continue this strategic alternation. Near the end, they briefly increase contribution from zero to a moderate level, then drop back to zero in the last round. This suggests they do not simply “give up” on cooperation as the game ends, but also do not invest in a final cooperative gesture. The return to zero in the last round is consistent with standard end-game defection, but the prior partial contribution just before that indicates some ongoing experimentation or a residual belief that cooperation may still yield benefit even late. Overall, end-game behavior indicates a payoff-focused type that knows defection is safe in the final round, yet does not fully collapse cooperation beforehand, perhaps because they still expect others to contribute or because they continue to test how punishers react.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThis player never uses the punishment mechanism, even though they are repeatedly punished themselves and can see that others employ punishment extensively. Their restraint persists under conditions where many group members punish defectors, plus some apparent “moralistic” or escalated punishment against certain others. The refusal to punish holds both when the player cooperates and when they defect. This suggests a strong reluctance to spend resources on sanctioning, regardless of potential deterrence value. Their non-use of punishment makes their motives unclear: they might judge punishment as too costly, as ineffective, or as something they do not want to participate in normatively. There is no evidence of retaliatory motives, since they never punish those who have punished them, despite punishers being identifiable. Nor do they use targeted punishment to steer others’ contributions or to reward cooperators by punishing defectors. This stable non-punishing stance points to a personality or strategy that is sanction-averse and unwilling to invest in enforcing norms, even when those norms work against them.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nWhen punished, the player does not respond with visible retaliation or observable appeasement toward specific punishers. They do not start punishing those who sanction them, even as some group members repeatedly target them when they defect. They also do not clearly adjust contribution in a direct, one-to-one way in response to punishment intensity. At times, after being punished for defection, they continue to defect in subsequent rounds, signaling resistance to coercion or at least a willingness to bear some punishment costs if defection remains profitable overall. At other times, they switch back from defection to high contribution after being punished, which might reflect learning about the environment or reacting to the overall group climate rather than obeying particular punishers. Since they never use punishment themselves, their behavior toward punishers overall is characterized by non-retaliation and relative indifference to individual-level blame, combined with some adaptive but inconsistent changes in contribution level after being sanctioned.\n\n<REWARD>\nThis player never uses the reward mechanism, despite the presence of repeated, identifiable high contributors who might be natural reward targets. They do not reward in periods of full cooperation, nor when others maintain high contributions while they free ride. Given that rewards are relatively inefficient compared to punishment in this environment, their non-use may reflect cost-benefit reasoning: they appear unwilling to pay a private cost to slightly increase others’ payoffs. There is no sign that they try to strategically cultivate allies or future cooperation through rewards. The total absence of rewarding in all phases of the game suggests that positive reciprocity via the formal reward channel is not part of their strategy, even when it might be used to signal gratitude or encourage continued high contributions.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThe player never receives any rewards, so their response to being rewarded is unknown.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThe player is consistently exposed to detailed information about others’ contributions, payoffs, and use of punishment and reward. Their own contribution path suggests they respond primarily to the general pattern that most others contribute substantial amounts and that punishment is actively used against defectors. Nonetheless, they do not join in sanctioning or rewarding, nor do they visibly differentiate among specific others based on who is punished or who punishes. They tolerate being the target of repeated sanctions while still occasionally free riding, indicating that they factor in others’ punitive behavior but treat it more as a predictable cost in a payoff calculation than as a moral signal to conform. There is no evidence that they try to protect or support others who are heavily punished, nor that they mirror the punitive norms of the majority. Overall, they observe the group’s outcomes and adapt their own contributions in a coarse way—alternating between cooperating and exploiting—rather than engaging deeply with the social dynamics of who earns what and why."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a moderately cooperative, inequality-sensitive contributor who anchors near the group norm and adjusts within a relatively narrow band. Contributions are consistently in the mid-range, neither exploiting the group nor fully maximizing the public good. The player appears conditional: when others’ average giving is higher, they are comfortable being slightly below or around that average; when the average falls, they do not compensate upward, and may even reduce their own contribution. This suggests a norm-following or reciprocity-based rule rather than a principled commitment to full cooperation.\n\nThey tolerate some disadvantage relative to higher contributors but do not push toward the socially efficient maximum. Their pattern indicates concern about not being the “sucker” who gives far more than others. Fairness norms seem present but moderate: they are willing to contribute at levels that keep them close to the middle of the distribution and avoid clear free-riding, but they do not seek to lead by example. Risk tolerance regarding others’ cooperation is also moderate; they neither collapse to zero nor leap to maximum contributions in response to uncertainty, favoring incremental, cautious adjustments instead of extreme shifts.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nAwareness of the finite horizon does not trigger a collapse to full defection, but it does coincide with a slight downward adjustment in cooperation. The player continues to contribute a nontrivial amount in the final stage, yet at the lower end of their own observed range. This is consistent with a mild end-game effect: they partially retract cooperation as the opportunity for future reciprocal gains or reputation benefits disappears, but they do not abandon the norm of contributing altogether.\n\nThis pattern suggests a mix of forward-looking reasoning and internalized preference for some level of cooperation. The player appears to value payoff maximization more strongly once continuation value is gone, while still maintaining an identity as a non-free-rider. There is no evidence of last-round escalation or altruistic “parting gift” behavior; instead, end-game behavior leans slightly toward self-interest while keeping within a cooperative frame.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThe player is willing to use costly punishment, but sparingly and in a targeted way. They never engage in broad or indiscriminate sanctioning, and they do not punish every below-average contributor available. This indicates selectivity and some threshold for when a deviation is worth addressing. Their use of sanctions is consistent with norm-enforcement rather than emotional retaliation or spite; the punished targets are those whose behavior is relatively less cooperative within the group, though not necessarily the lowest in all cases. Because punishers are anonymous, any punishment they impose is unlikely to be driven by expectations of personal gratitude or direct reciprocity, reinforcing the interpretation that they care about shaping group norms or correcting perceived unfairness.\n\nThey are not obsessed with punishment: they expend only small amounts on it and cease punishing even when there remain identifiable lower contributors. This suggests they weigh the cost of sanctioning against its potential effects and may perceive diminishing returns or sufficient “message sent” after limited intervention. There is no direct evidence of retaliatory punishment in response to being punished themselves; any such motive is unknown. Overall, they function as a light-touch, efficiency-aware norm enforcer rather than a harsh disciplinarian.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThe player monitors others’ contributions and payoffs and appears sensitive to relative standing. They adjust their own contribution and punishment behavior in ways that track shifts in the group’s cooperative level. Higher dispersion in outcomes, especially when driven by very low or very high contributions, seems to prompt selective corrective action through punishment rather than large shifts in their own behavior. They do not overreact to others earning more; when their own payoff is strong relative to the group, they do not compensate by becoming more generous. When their payoff is weaker or when others’ low contributions reduce group returns, they do not withdraw completely but do become slightly more self-protective.\n\nThey react to punishment patterns as well: after being on the receiving end of deductions, they maintain nonzero contributions and do not escalate to either aggressive punishment or full defection. This indicates some tolerance for being sanctioned and an inclination to stay within a cooperative norm even when personally disadvantaged. However, there is no clear evidence that they interpret others’ punishment as a precise signal guiding their adjustments; the exact belief they hold about why they are punished is unknown. Broadly, the player responds to group outcomes with moderate adaptation rather than drastic strategic shifts, aiming to remain near the cooperative center while modestly guarding against exploitation."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a flexible conditional cooperator with opportunistic streaks and clear sensitivity to the partner’s past behavior. They alternate between full defection and full cooperation rather than using intermediate levels (forced binary choice here, but they also switch cleanly between the two options). Early on, they free-ride even when the partner fully cooperates, suggesting that initial priorities are self-payoff and exploitation rather than fairness. When the partner mirrors them with low contribution, they immediately accept mutual defection and do not try to unilaterally restore cooperation. Later, once mutual cooperation is established, they reliably match the partner’s high contribution for an extended stretch, indicating that they are willing to sustain efficient cooperation when it is reciprocal and not being “taxed” by punishment. They also revert to defection once, despite the partner still cooperating, indicating that they are not rigidly norm-driven; they are willing to take a profitable deviation when not recently punished and when they perceive the relationship as relatively stable. Overall, they display low intrinsic fairness concern but moderate willingness to cooperate when treated as an equal, and they appear comfortable with payoff asymmetries in their favor.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThe player is clearly aware of the finite horizon (they see the round index and behave differently near the end). In the final portion of the game, they maintain high contributions instead of decaying to defection, despite having been punished in the past. This suggests that they do not use the standard backward-induction style collapse of cooperation; rather, they keep cooperating when mutual cooperation is in place, even as the end approaches. However, they increase the use of punishment again at the very end despite ongoing cooperation, suggesting that end-game for them is a time to settle scores or reassert norms rather than to maximize joint payoff. There is no evidence that they try to exploit the partner via last-round defection; they instead combine full cooperation with renewed punishment, indicating that “final word” in the punishment domain matters more than squeezing out last-round material advantage.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThe player is a willing punisher whose use of punishment is not tightly tied to contemporaneous contribution behavior. They punish after being punished themselves, with no change in the partner’s contribution pattern to justify it, consistent with a retaliatory or expressive motive rather than pure norm enforcement. They never punish for low contributions by the partner (which essentially never happen after the very early game), so there is no evidence of classic altruistic punishment against free-riders. Instead, they direct punishment at a consistently high-contributing partner, repeatedly and at nontrivial personal cost, even when mutual cooperation is strong. This pattern suggests spite, retribution, or an attempt to “even out” earlier perceived unfairness in how punishment was used against them. The punishment is selective (only the partner, never self and never omitted when they choose to use it) but not clearly calibrated to current deviations; it appears history-dependent and emotionally driven rather than forward-looking deterrence. Their choice to stop punishing for a while, then resume, suggests dynamic emotional thresholds: they can suspend hostility when the interaction is calm, but grievances resurface and are expressed through sanctioning even in cooperative states.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nWhen punished early on while defecting against a cooperator, the player does not immediately adjust in a straightforward compliant way; they continue to defect at first, then later shift to cooperation once mutual defection appears and the partner stops using punishments. This delayed adjustment implies that punishment alone does not compel immediate norm compliance; instead, the player seems to react to the broader interaction pattern (including the partner’s eventual change in contribution) rather than the sanction per se. They never punish the partner in the same periods as they are punished; their retaliatory punishment comes later, once they themselves are cooperating and the partner has ceased punishing. This indicates that they remember being targeted and eventually respond with their own sanctions, but not in an immediate tit-for-tat fashion. They do not escalate into punishment wars when directly attacked; rather, they absorb punishment at first, later retaliate in a separate phase, and then partially de-escalate again. There is no evidence of forgiveness in the sense of forgoing retaliation; instead, they compartmentalize their response over time, suggesting long memory and a tendency to “settle accounts” when conditions are safe (i.e., without risking immediate further punishment).\n\n<REWARD>\nThe player never uses the reward option despite multiple opportunities and despite long stretches where the partner contributes maximally and does not punish. This indicates a very low propensity for positive reciprocity via material rewards. Even when the partner behaves cooperatively and refrains from sanctions, the player does not invest to reinforce or acknowledge this behavior. Their social control toolkit is one-sided: they are willing to impose costly punishment but unwilling to spend even minimal resources to reward. This pattern is consistent with a type that views the game primarily through a payoffs-and-grievances lens, not through gratitude or alliance-building. It also suggests that if they wish to signal approval or cooperation, they prefer to do so via their own contribution choices rather than through explicit monetary rewards.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nUnknown; the player is never rewarded, so their response to identifiable rewarders cannot be inferred. There is no behavioral evidence regarding whether they would reciprocate, increase cooperation, or form alliances following rewards.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThe player pays attention to the partner’s outcomes and actions, as their shifts in contribution and sanctioning track changes in the partner’s punishment behavior and contribution level. Early in the game, when they earn more than the partner while free-riding and being punished, they continue that strategy for a short time, indicating tolerance for unequal outcomes that favor them and a lack of guilt-driven adjustment. Once mutual contributions become equal and payoffs symmetric, they sustain cooperation, implying some satisfaction with equitable high-payoff states. However, they also impose punishment on a fully cooperative partner, knowingly creating inequality against the other player at cost to themselves; this looks like outcome-based retribution rather than efficiency or fairness seeking. They do not appear to try to maximize joint payoffs—they willingly destroy surplus through punishment even in efficient cooperative states. Overall, they respond to others’ outcomes primarily as a cue for whether they owe retribution or can safely express hostility, rather than as a target for egalitarian correction or welfare maximization."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a strategic, mixed contributor who alternates between full free-riding and full contribution rather than using intermediate levels. They are clearly aware of the social environment and adapt their choices to the observed pattern of others’ contributions: they sometimes contribute fully when many others are also contributing, and sometimes free-ride despite high group cooperation. Their pattern does not strictly follow a simple conditional cooperator rule (e.g., “match others”); instead, they appear to balance personal payoff maximization with occasional cooperative moves. They do not insist on strict fairness: they are willing both to exploit high contributors and to join them. Their volatility in contribution suggests they are experimenting or strategically toggling between roles rather than following a rigid norm. Their willingness to be among the lowest contributors in some rounds shows tolerance for social risk (being identified and punished) in exchange for higher short-term payoffs. Under uncertainty about others’ future behavior, they appear to test both cooperative and selfish responses rather than commit to one stable identity.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThe player shows awareness of the finite horizon and does not drift into pure end-game defection. Instead, they end with full contribution and receive positive social reinforcement for it, indicating that they maintain or even slightly increase cooperation at the end rather than letting it decay. This suggests that they do not treat the final round purely as a one-shot payoff-maximization opportunity; they remain responsive to established group norms and social feedback even when there is no future interaction within this game. Their final-round cooperation is consistent with a desire to maintain a cooperative image or to be “deserving” in social terms, even if there is no direct future payoff from that reputation in this setting.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThe player consistently abstains from using punishment, despite experiencing multiple instances of being punished themself. This indicates a strong reluctance to spend resources to sanction others, whether for deterrence or retaliation. They do not appear motivated by vengeance, norm enforcement, or payoff equalization via punishment. Even when there are clear low contributors in the group, they choose not to sanction them, suggesting that norm-policing is not part of their strategy. Their behavior is consistent with a type that prefers to adjust own contributions rather than actively shape others’ behavior through costly negative sanctions. Whether this is due to moral aversion to punishment, skepticism about its effectiveness, or simple cost-consciousness is unknown.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nWhen punished, the player does not retaliate through punishment, does not escalate, and does not withdraw into stable defection. Instead, they sometimes move toward cooperation following episodes in which they are targeted. This indicates a relatively non-confrontational, non-retaliatory stance toward punishers: they appear willing to accept negative feedback without engaging in counter-sanctioning. They do not visibly shift to systematically “comply” with presumed punishment demands; their subsequent choices remain mixed rather than becoming uniformly cooperative. Overall, they respond to being punished with mild behavioral adjustment and continued experimentation, not with revenge or entrenched hostility.\n\n<REWARD>\nThe player never uses the reward option, even when there are consistent high contributors and even when they themselves benefit from others’ cooperation. This suggests a strong reluctance to spend resources on positive reinforcement. They do not appear to seek to build alliances or signal gratitude via costly rewards. Their cooperative moves are not accompanied by attempts to shape others’ behavior through incentives; instead, they treat contribution and redistribution as the main levers of interaction. This may reflect a cost-minimizing mindset, indifference to direct reciprocity tools, or uncertainty about the strategic value of rewarding; which of these is primary is unknown.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nWhen they receive reward, the player does not reciprocate with direct reward but does at times maintain or adopt cooperative contributions afterward. They accept positive reinforcement without mirroring it in kind, indicating that they prioritize their own payoff over symmetric reciprocity in the reward channel. However, they do not exploit rewards by immediately reverting to full defection; instead, they remain behaviorally flexible and sometimes continue to cooperate. This pattern fits a type that is receptive to social approval but not willing to pay to return favors in this mechanism. They may internalize reward as confirmation that cooperation is valued, influencing their contribution choices more than their use of the reward tool itself."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a late-converting conditional cooperator with an initial free‑riding bias. When contributing is framed as an all‑or‑nothing choice, they start by consistently taking the selfish option even in a cooperative environment, indicating an initial priority on individual payoff over group welfare. They update their behavior after accumulating social feedback via rewards and punishments, eventually switching to full contribution and then maintaining it to the end. Their shift suggests they are responsive to norms: once it becomes clear that high contribution is the prevailing pattern and is socially reinforced, they align with that pattern. The change is abrupt rather than gradual, implying a strategic “test, then conform” style rather than continual fine‑tuning. They tolerate some personal disadvantage (being punished while not contributing, and later contributing despite lingering low contributors) once they perceive a stable cooperative norm backed by incentives. Their risk tolerance appears moderate: they are willing to experiment with non‑cooperation early, but once they sense that the environment rewards cooperation, they avoid further deviation.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThe player shows no visible end‑game defection: once they switch to full cooperation, they sustain it through the final round despite knowing the horizon. This suggests that, after internalizing the cooperative norm and associated incentives, they are not inclined to exploit the last round for short‑term gain. They appear horizon‑aware in the sense that their behavioral change occurs mid‑game rather than only right before the last round, but they do not display the classic pattern of cooperation decay as the end approaches. Their strategy seems anchored more in current social expectations and payoff structure than in a backward‑induction logic. Whether they explicitly think in terms of end‑game reasoning is unknown, but behaviorally they maintain consistency once settled on a cooperative stance.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThis player never uses punishment, even when others free‑ride more heavily than they do and even after being punished themselves. This indicates a strong reluctance to incur personal cost solely to impose losses on others. They do not appear motivated by retaliation, deterrence, or norm enforcement through negative sanctions. The absence of any punitive response when they are personally targeted suggests they either downplay punishment as a useful tool, accept it as part of the game, or prefer to respond through positive strategies (changing their own contribution or using rewards). Their threshold for using punishment is either very high or principled against using it; which is unclear, but their observed type is a non‑punisher.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nWhen punished while free‑riding, the player does not retaliate and does not try to “punish back,” despite having full opportunity and identifiable punishers. Instead, their later behavioral change moves in the direction that punishers likely want: they increase their contribution and align with the cooperative norm. This suggests a compliance‑oriented or adaptive response rather than vindictive behavior. They appear to interpret punishment (and accompanying reward patterns) as information about prevailing expectations rather than as a provocation. They neither reward nor punish their punishers specifically, so direct targeted reciprocity toward punishers (positive or negative) is not evident; their adjustment is global rather than directed at particular individuals.\n\n<REWARD>\nThe player is willing to spend on rewards and uses them selectively to reinforce cooperative behavior. They reward high contributors while still free‑riding themselves, which indicates a strategic or norm‑signaling use of rewards rather than purely reciprocal gratitude. At times they reward multiple cooperative peers simultaneously, suggesting they care about broadly supporting the cooperative cluster rather than forming a narrow dyadic alliance. The magnitude of rewards remains small relative to potential payoff, consistent with a cautious or budget‑conscious approach: they acknowledge and support cooperation but do not invest heavily in it. They never combine reward with simultaneous punishment, preferring exclusively positive sanctioning. Overall, they act as a low‑intensity positive reciprocator and norm supporter: using reward to encourage cooperation, including cooperation they are benefitting from without yet fully matching.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThe player receives rewards after they begin contributing, and they do not respond by engaging in explicit reciprocal reward toward those specific individuals. Instead, their main response is to maintain cooperative contributions while ceasing to use the reward tool themselves. This pattern suggests that the positive feedback helps stabilize their cooperative choice, but they do not use it to build targeted alliances or tit‑for‑tat reward cycles. They seem satisfied to be recognized and do not escalate reward behavior in response, implying a limited interest in active “reward networks.” Their orientation is more: contribute in line with others and let any further reward dynamics be handled by others. Whether they feel gratitude at a psychological level is unknown, but in strategic terms they answer reward with stable cooperation rather than direct reciprocal transfers."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a highly inconsistent contributor who treats contribution choices as a way to express moral positions and opposition to group behavior, not as a way to maximize payoff. They sometimes match the group’s full-contribution norm, but they also repeatedly free-ride even when that predictably triggers extreme punishment and huge losses. Their switches between contributing and not contributing align with social and moral stances: they contribute fully when they feel aligned with a cooperative, non-bullying norm, and withhold when they are resisting or protesting the group’s behavior. They do not appear risk-averse; they are willing to incur very large, predictable losses rather than conform to norms they see as unethical. They do not prioritize efficiency or aggregate earnings; instead they prioritize maintaining their own notion of integrity, even when that sharply reduces payoffs for themselves and, at times, for others. Fairness for them is defined less by payoff patterns and more by whether people are treated respectfully.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nTheir tone is moralizing but not overtly abusive; they criticize others’ behavior as “bullying” and “disgusting,” but avoid name-calling beyond reactive barbs when provoked. They explicitly frame their actions as guided by “morals,” and indicate they would rather personally lose money than be complicit in behavior they see as cruel. They are willing to stand against a clear majority and remain engaged in dialogue even while being mocked and punished. They confront the dominant coalition repeatedly, arguing that targeting and mocking a single low contributor is wrong, and later that the sustained harassment is unacceptable. Their communication is reactive and principled rather than strategic: they are not trying to coordinate a sub-group or redirect incentives, they are staking out a position of moral refusal. They continue to respond for several rounds under heavy social pressure, then go quiet later, suggesting emotional fatigue or a decision that further argument is pointless. Overall, they are socially engaged, values-driven, and prepared to be socially isolated to maintain their stance.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nAwareness of the finite horizon does not lead them to a payoff-maximizing end-game strategy. Instead of converging to a stable high-contribution pattern to salvage earnings, they maintain a low-contribution stance across late rounds even as punishment remains intense, indicating that their primary goal is not final payoff. They do not appear to adjust behavior in the final rounds to avoid last-minute punishment, nor do they escalate retaliation (they never punish at all). Their late-game choices remain consistent with an ongoing moral protest rather than with backward induction or standard end-game defection/cooperation logic. There is no evidence that the approaching last round changes their priorities; they stay in character rather than “cashing out” rationally.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey never spend any coins on punishment despite repeatedly suffering extremely heavy deductions and being insulted by several others. This strongly suggests they reject the use of punitive tools in this environment on principle. Their chat contributions reinforce this: they criticize others specifically for using punishment and ridicule against a single low contributor and then against themselves. They are not interested in deterrence, reciprocity, or retaliation, even when it would be emotionally understandable. Instead, they absorb large losses while continuing to argue against what they see as bullying. They do not selectively punish even clear norm violators; rather than enforce norms, they question the legitimacy of the prevailing norm itself. Their stance is thus “anti-punishment” and anti-bullying: they view the punishment system, as used by others, as morally corrupting, and decline to participate in it even at a significant personal cost."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is primarily self-regarding and typically withholds contributions when they expect others not to cooperate. They begin by taking the selfish action even when another player behaves cooperatively, suggesting they do not follow strong fairness or reciprocity norms. Their pattern shows a readiness to free-ride when there is a cooperator present and to continue free-riding when others also defect. They eventually switch once to full contribution despite others’ continued non-cooperation, indicating some volatility and possible experimentation rather than a rigid strategy. This switch does not appear to be conditional on others’ improvement, since others remain non-contributing; it likely reflects curiosity, a late attempt to test the mechanism, or a momentary prosocial impulse rather than a stable cooperative rule. Overall, they show low baseline willingness to sacrifice for group benefit and moderate risk tolerance in briefly trying a fully cooperative move without supportive evidence from peers.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nUnknown. There is no observable chat or messaging, so their tone, coordination efforts, and responsiveness through communication cannot be inferred. Their engagement style must be inferred solely from contribution and sanctioning behavior.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThe player is highly willing to spend on punishment, even when they themselves contribute nothing. They punish both a cooperator and a defector at different times, suggesting that sanctions are not tied to a simple “punish free-riders, spare cooperators” norm. Punishing a contributing peer indicates either a desire to exploit cooperators (by discouraging them or reducing their payoff) or confusion about what behavior merits sanction. Later, they consistently target a clear non-contributor while they also remain a non-contributor, which aligns more with expressive or retaliatory motives than with norm enforcement, since they are not modeling the cooperative norm they appear to demand. They show no evidence of using punishment to reward-turnaround or to encourage improvement; instead, sanctions continue even when group contributions collapse. Their targeting suggests they may react to perceived slight or to another’s earlier behavior, but the exact trigger is unknown. They display a willingness to pay nontrivial personal cost to reduce others’ payoffs, indicating a taste for punitive leverage or strong negative reciprocity, with low selectivity and low alignment with classic fairness-based punishment.\n\n<REWARD>\nThe player never uses the reward option, despite having opportunities to do so, including when another player behaves cooperatively. This indicates that they do not invest in positive reinforcement or gratitude signaling, even when such behavior could be seen as fostering future cooperation. The absence of rewarding, combined with frequent punishment, points to a sanctioning style that is purely negative: they are willing to hurt others at a cost to themselves but not to help them at a similar cost. This suggests they either discount the strategic value of rewards, see them as a waste, or simply do not experience positive reciprocity motives strongly enough to act on them."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a mostly-high contributor with strategic deviations. After an initial low contribution while the group is already cooperative, they quickly match the full-contribution norm and maintain it for a substantial stretch. They clearly understand that mutual high contributions are beneficial and are willing to contribute at the maximum level when the group does so.\n\nThey do not, however, conform rigidly. At several points they under-contribute relative to others while the rest of the group stays fully cooperative. These deviations are not random: they occur after a long run of stable, high cooperation from the group, and yield them a clear personal payoff advantage while only modestly harming the group outcome. This pattern fits a “cautious free-rider” or “conditional cooperator with opportunism” type: they are broadly willing to cooperate when others do, but they intermittently exploit the cooperative environment without signaling any change in norms.\n\nThey appear insensitive to marginal deviations in group behavior, because the group’s contributions are remarkably stable and high throughout; their choices are therefore best read as primarily driven by their own payoff calculations rather than as reactions to changing peer behavior. They tolerate the risk of being seen as contributing less, but since no punishment is available, their risk is limited to social disapproval, which they do not comment on. Fairness norms seem mixed: they promote group benefit verbally yet accept personally favorable inequities when they can secure them. Across the game, their contributions are mostly high but not strictly stable, showing calculated volatility rather than random noise.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nTheir communication style is sparse, upbeat, and focused on coordination. They make one explicit attempt to encourage full cooperation, using inclusive language and framing high contributions as a positive, shared action. This suggests they value establishing and reinforcing a cooperative norm, especially after delays or uncertainty.\n\nThey respond implicitly to others’ chat that advocates cooperation (by aligning their behavior with it), but they do not engage in back-and-forth dialogue, corrections, or explicit sanctioning. They neither confront nor justify their own later under-contributions, indicating a low-communication, low-conflict style: they are willing to talk to get everyone coordinated but avoid commentary once behavior stabilizes.\n\nTone is friendly and lightly motivational, not demanding or moralizing. They do not question others or express doubts about their intentions. There is no evidence of them using communication strategically to excuse or explain their opportunistic deviations, suggesting they rely more on the anonymity and the absence of punishment than on verbal persuasion to cover their free-riding episodes. Responsiveness to others’ specific messages beyond adopting the general “let’s all contribute” frame is unknown.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey consistently refrain from using the reward mechanism. Despite being in a highly cooperative group where every other visible player contributes at the top level for the entire game, they never spend anything to reward others. This holds even when their own contribution decisions could make them appear less generous; they still do not offset that with rewards.\n\nThis indicates a strongly payoff-maximizing stance toward reward: they are not willing to sacrifice even one unit of their own payoff to reinforce or thank high contributors, even though reward is one-to-one and clearly targeted. They rely entirely on contribution choices and do not use the reward tool as a strategic lever to maintain cooperation or build allies. They also do not try to compensate others for their own free-riding periods.\n\nTheir lack of rewarding cannot be explained by absence of deserving targets, since peers are reliably cooperating. The most consistent interpretation is that they prioritize preserving their own coins over any prosocial or strategic value from rewarding. Whether they conceptually see reward as ineffective, unnecessary, or simply too costly is unknown; the observed behavior aligns with a “non-rewarding, efficiency-seeking opportunist” type.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThey never receive any reward, so there is no direct evidence of how they react to being rewarded or of any reciprocity toward identifiable rewarders. Consequently, their propensity to form alliances based on mutual rewarding, or to reinforce those who reward them or others, remains unknown. Given their own zero use of the reward mechanism in a fully cooperative environment, the best low-confidence inference is that even if rewarded, they are unlikely to invest much in reciprocating through reward, and may instead treat it as a windfall without changing their basic strategy. However, this is speculative and not grounded in observed responses."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a strategically opportunistic, mildly volatile contributor who switches between full defection and full contribution rather than using intermediate levels (which are not available in this game anyway). They begin by free-riding despite early group norms that favor contributing, then later oscillate between cooperating and defecting. Their choices are clearly conditional on perceived group behavior and on expectations about future play: when they explicitly state they will contribute and group messages suggest cooperation, they sometimes still defect; when they later express that “everyone” should stop donating, they themselves defect in the next round but then contribute again even after calling for non-contribution. This indicates inconsistent follow-through rather than a fixed rule like “copy the majority” or “always defect once others start defecting.”\n\nFairness norms appear weak or inconsistent. They complain about particular low contributors and “greedy” behavior in chat, but they also exploit cooperators multiple times, including in the very first cooperative wave. They seem to understand that high contributions with a high multiplier are beneficial for the group, yet their own behavior shows they prioritize their individual payoff when tempted, particularly when they believe cooperation is breaking down. Risk tolerance appears moderate: they are willing to defect when many others are cooperating (taking a reputational risk in chat) but also later contribute in the final round despite simultaneous calls to defect, suggesting some willingness to risk being the sucker or simply acting inconsistently. Overall, they fit a “conditional opportunist” type rather than a consistent cooperator or consistent free-rider.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nTheir tone is informal, reactive, and sometimes hostile. Initially they say they will contribute along with others, adopting the group’s cooperative language, but their actions do not match that statement. They engage in light teasing and blame toward identified low contributors, indicating they notice contribution patterns and are willing to call out perceived defectors by name. As the game progresses and some players openly discuss greed and misunderstanding, they become more abrasive and insulting, using direct personal attacks. This suggests low politeness and a readiness to escalate emotionally when they feel the system or other players are not behaving as they think they should.\n\nThey participate in coordination attempts but in a somewhat loose, non-leadership style. They echo others’ sentiments (e.g., agreeing that if certain behavior “carries on” then they will react) rather than creating detailed plans or persuading with arguments about long-run payoffs. Their persuasion style is more emotional and blunt than reasoned. They are responsive to ongoing chat—reacting quickly to others’ comments and specific players’ behavior—but they do not engage in careful negotiation or alliance-building; communication seems more about venting and social signaling than about building stable cooperative coalitions.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThey clearly recognize the finite horizon and explicitly reference the finality of the later rounds, including endorsing a coordinated refusal to donate at the end. They support a strategy of universal defection in the last round when others mention that there are no more rounds to follow. However, their actual final decision contradicts their own call for everyone not to donate: they end up fully contributing in the final round while several others defect. This mismatch indicates either last-moment indecision, susceptibility to social pressure from cooperators, confusion, or possibly a weak grasp of backward induction in practice despite understanding that it is the final round.\n\nCooperation does not monotonically decay as the end approaches; instead, their pattern is non-monotonic and inconsistent. They defect in a late round while affirming that “the fun is over,” then contribute in the last round after promoting non-contribution. This suggests they are influenced by immediate impressions and chat dynamics more than by a strict end-game logic. Overall, they show awareness of the end-game but do not implement a clean “defect at the end” strategy; their end-game behavior is better described as noisy and reactive.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey never use the reward mechanism at all, despite multiple opportunities and clear observability of others’ contributions and rewards. There is no evidence of them experimenting with rewarding either cooperators or defectors. The absence of any reward spending, even when others discuss and use rewards, suggests they see little personal value in paying to influence others’ behavior in this environment, or they may not find the mechanism salient or worthwhile. They neither employ reward for reciprocal gratitude, for strategic reinforcement of cooperators, nor as a signaling device. Their behavioral pattern is consistent with treating reward as dominated or irrelevant rather than as a tool for shaping the game.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThey are never rewarded by anyone during the game, so their response to being rewarded is unknown. They also never reward others, so there is no scope to observe reciprocal rewarding or alliance-building around the reward mechanism. Their chat does not reference rewarding as something they would consider, either positively or negatively, beyond acknowledging another player’s frustration about not being rewarded. As a result, their reciprocity via reward, gratitude expression, or alliance responses to known rewarders is unknown.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey visibly track who contributes and who free-rides, and they react verbally to others’ outcomes and behaviors. They join in identifying particular low contributors and express annoyance at specific individuals who defect while others cooperate. Their comments about “greedy” behavior and “not understanding maths” (endorsed or echoed from others) show that they evaluate others not just on contribution level but also in terms of perceived rationality and fairness. At the same time, they do not adjust via reward; their only responses are verbal criticism or sarcastic remarks, which suggests a preference for expressive sanctioning over costly behavioral sanctioning or reinforcement.\n\nWhen someone invests heavily in rewards and receives no reciprocal benefit, they do not offer compensation or sympathy; instead, they remain focused on contributions and self-payoffs. They notice shifts in the player count and acknowledge when “the fun is over,” indicating that they are attentive to the game’s changing context and the decline in cooperation. However, their own strategic adjustments are limited to alternating between cooperation and defection rather than more nuanced responses tied to detailed payoff observations. In sum, they monitor others’ outcomes sufficiently to identify free-riders, complain about them, and sometimes adapt by defecting themselves, but they do not leverage the reward mechanism or consistent cooperative strategies in response."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a mixed, somewhat erratic conditional cooperator with light opportunistic streaks. They alternate between full contribution and full free-riding rather than stabilizing on one pattern. They fully contribute in several rounds even when some others defect, which indicates a baseline willingness to cooperate and accept short-term personal cost for group benefit. However, they also selectively free-ride when they see substantial non-contribution or when norms appear to deteriorate, suggesting their cooperation is conditional on perceived group behavior and mood. They do not systematically punish defectors through their own contributions (e.g., they still sometimes contribute when a coordinated “no one donate” message appears) and are not rigidly payoff-maximizing. Their pattern shows moderate risk tolerance: they are willing to risk being exploited by contributing in uncertain social climates, but they also protect their payoff at times by defecting when group cooperation feels unstable or “over.” Fairness norms appear present but not strongly enforced: they do not insist on strict reciprocity and seem comfortable mixing cooperative and self-interested moves without trying to justify or defend them in chat.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nTheir communication is sparse, reactive, and casually irreverent. They speak very little relative to the group and do not initiate coordination or strategy discussions. When they do comment, they react with brief emotional or evaluative remarks (e.g., finding certain behaviors amusing or “cringe”), rather than offering explicit analysis or persuasion. Their tone is light, somewhat mocking, and non-serious; they appear to treat the environment more as a humorous social space than as a high-stakes cooperative problem. They respond directly when another player makes a broad negative judgment about the group, pushing back briefly but without aggression. They do not explicitly shame defectors, defend contributors, or try to rally others around a norm, and they never answer questions about rules or payoffs. Overall, they engage minimally, react rather than initiate, and avoid deep involvement in group norm-building.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThey are aware of the finite horizon, as the group openly discusses the final round and “no one donate” strategies. In the face of explicit proposals to collectively defect at the end, they still choose to contribute at least once in the closing phase. This indicates that they do not fully adopt a standard end-game unraveling logic, and they are not strictly following the explicit “everyone defect” coordination attempts. Their end-game behavior suggests either a persistent cooperative inclination, a desire to “play their own game” regardless of last-round logic, or a limited concern with extracting maximum final-period payoff. There is no evidence they strategically escalate defection purely because the game is ending; instead, their final behavior blends prior tendencies: some opportunism earlier, but willingness to cooperate even at the end under social uncertainty. Their verbal response to being called “whack” in the last round is defensive but light, again suggesting they perceive their pattern as at least somewhat defensible or normal.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey never spend any coins on rewards. Despite clear instructions and multiple examples of others using the mechanism, they consistently allocate zero to everyone, including high contributors and those who reward others. This indicates either that they see little instrumental value in rewarding (given its neutral tech and the group’s skepticism) or that they are generally unwilling to incur personal cost to positively reinforce others. They do not discuss the reward mechanism themselves beyond reacting socially to others’ usage; their “cringe” comment after a cluster of rewards suggests mild disapproval or ridicule of players who lean heavily into rewarding. This reaction hints that they may view reward use—especially generous or unilateral reward—as socially awkward or strategically pointless, reinforcing their own decision not to engage with it.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThey are never rewarded by anyone during the game, so direct reciprocity to rewarders cannot be observed. When another player engages heavily with rewards and then complains about lack of reciprocation, this player shows no verbal sympathy, promise of future reward, or change in their own rewarding behavior. Their “cringe” comment following visible reward activity is a negative social evaluation rather than appreciation or alliance-seeking. This suggests low propensity for forming positive-reciprocity loops through the reward institution, and no inclination to “pay back” generous others via the same channel. Their stance toward rewarders is distanced and mildly mocking rather than grateful or coalition-building. Any underlying feeling toward rewarders beyond this is unknown.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey pay attention enough to see how others behave and react socially, but they do not explicitly comment on payoffs, contribution statistics, or cost-benefit logic. They never mention who gained or lost from rewards, nor do they refer to specific multipliers or payoff calculations, so their explicit reasoning about outcomes remains unknown. Their reactions are affective and social: they find some players’ reward-heavy or norm-enforcing behavior embarrassing or amusing and label the group as “whack” when accused, pushing back with mild incredulity rather than apologizing or explaining. They do not protest when defectors profit, nor do they congratulate efficient cooperators. Overall, they observe the unfolding social dynamics and occasionally respond with brief humor or derision, but they abstain from outcome-based moralizing, economic argumentation, or targeted responses to specific players’ gains and losses."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player alternates between full cooperation and full free-riding, with no partial moves available. They initially cooperate strongly when the group is clearly coordinating on high contributions, then quickly become willing to defect once others start deviating or when group cohesion looks fragile. Their pattern shows conditional cooperation rather than unconditional altruism: they contribute when most others do and when cooperative norms appear strong, but switch to non-contribution when low contributors appear or when talk turns to “everyone stop contributing.” They do not verbally participate in norm enforcement or planning, so their conditionality is inferred entirely from their own switches in contribution relative to group behavior. Fairness concerns, if present, are not expressed in chat; their behavior could be consistent with “I cooperate if that seems the group standard, but I will not bear extra cost when others free-ride.” They appear comfortable taking payoff-advantage positions when many others contribute and they do not, indicating moderate-to-low aversion to profiting from others’ cooperation. Risk tolerance is moderate: they are willing to contribute when many do (low risk of being the lone cooperator), and willing to free-ride even when some still contribute (risking social disapproval but facing no punishment).\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThey do not send any chat messages across the game. They do not attempt to coordinate, persuade, or question others. Their style is fully passive and observant: silent, non-confrontational, and non-reassuring. They neither support cooperators verbally nor criticize defectors, and they do not respond to direct or indirect prompts from others. This suggests either low engagement with the social/communicative layer or a preference to avoid social entanglements and reputational commitments while still adapting their actions to the observed environment. Their non-participation in chat means they never signal intentions, norms, or emotions; all social inference must come from their choices.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThey clearly know the game horizon, as the remaining number of rounds is visible, but they never comment on it. Behaviorally, they do not show a straightforward monotonic end-game collapse from cooperation to defection; instead, they oscillate: cooperating after initial high cooperation emerges, then defecting even before the final round when group norms weaken, and staying non-contributing at the very end despite a substantial number of cooperators. Their final-round choice is payoff-maximizing given their beliefs that enough others will still contribute and that no punishment exists. There is no evidence they seek to “reward” prior cooperators with a final cooperative act; instead they exploit residual cooperation in the last round. This pattern is consistent with a player who understands that later rounds are safer points for defection, especially once chatter about not contributing appears, and who does not see reputational or future-round reasons to maintain cooperation at the end.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey never spend any coins on reward, despite reward being available throughout. They also do not encourage or endorse rewarding in chat. Their behavior is consistent with treating the reward mechanism as individually useless or at best neutral: they do not use it to build alliances, to reciprocate, or to shape others’ behavior. Even when reward is actively used by a few others, they remain non-participatory. This suggests a strongly self-regarding stance toward costly prosocial adjustments beyond the main contribution decision. They may implicitly view reward as an unnecessary expenditure that does not change others’ behavior enough to justify the cost, or simply as an extra layer they choose to ignore. In any case, they are not a rewarder type.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThey receive reward once early on and never comment on it in chat. They do not reciprocate to that specific rewarder, nor do they start rewarding anyone afterward. There is no observable shift in their contribution pattern that is clearly attributable to having been rewarded: their later cooperation and defection decisions appear tied to the overall contribution pattern and group talk, not to bilateral gratitude. Their reaction to being rewarded is thus behaviorally neutral: no explicit thanks, no alliance-forming, no targeted return reward. This is consistent with low concern for interpersonal reciprocity via the reward channel and a preference to continue playing their own strategy independent of specific favors from others.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey see full outcome information, including who contributes, who defects, and who spends on rewards, yet they remain silent. Their contribution pattern shows sensitivity to aggregate group behavior but not visible moral judgment: they do not join in calling out defectors or defending cooperators; they simply adjust their own actions. When others exploit cooperation (e.g., high payoff defectors), they do not respond with compensating cooperation or with counter free-riding claims in chat; instead, they behave in a way that can also profit from group cooperation while minimizing their own costs in some rounds. They never reward those who pay costs to reward others, even when those rewarders give up significant payoffs, which suggests they do not treat costly prosocial behavior as something to be supported at personal expense. Overall, they appear observant but strategically reserved: they use information about others’ contributions and outcomes to decide whether to contribute or free-ride, but they do not engage with others’ payoffs socially, emotionally, or normatively in any explicit way."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a mixed, somewhat inconsistent cooperator. They alternate between full contribution and full free-riding rather than adopting a stable strategy. Early on, they cooperate when others are pushing for group contributions, then quickly switch to free-riding when they see that not everyone is contributing and that free-riding is profitable. Later, they return to full cooperation even when influential voices in the group advocate for universal defection. Their behavior suggests they understand the payoff structure at least at a basic level (they experience both high payoffs from free-riding and lower payoffs from contributing while others defect) but do not follow a purely self-interested dominant-strategy path. Instead, they appear to be weakly conditional: more willing to cooperate when the group is in a generally cooperative mode, but still sometimes contributing even when many others do not. Their choices indicate at most moderate risk tolerance: they are willing to risk earning less than defectors in order to sustain or re-establish cooperation, but not consistently. Fairness norms are ambiguous: they accept earning strictly less than non-contributors multiple times without protesting or adjusting to match defectors immediately. Overall, the type is a “quiet, somewhat conditional cooperator who occasionally free-rides” rather than a strict altruist or strict egoist.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThey are minimally communicative and socially low-key. They only speak twice. Their first message introduces themselves in a neutral, friendly way after others have already greeted each other, indicating a willingness to participate socially but not to lead the conversation. They never attempt to coordinate strategies, persuade others, or call out free-riders. They do not respond to others’ direct mentions of their behavior, even when someone publicly points out that they did not contribute in a given round. Later, they comment once, expressing a light, somewhat resigned attitude when cooperation has clearly broken down. The tone remains mild and non-confrontational; there is no moralizing, anger, or pressure toward others. They show low engagement with ongoing debates about fairness, reward, or “math,” and instead adopt an observer stance with brief, affective commentary. Responsiveness to others is low: they do not pick up on suggestions to “refuse to donate,” nor do they reinforce calls to cooperate or defect in chat.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThey are aware that the game has a fixed, short horizon; they see others explicitly discuss the final round. Despite clear end-game signaling and calls by several players to stop contributing near the end, they continue to make full contributions in both of the last two rounds. This indicates a weak or absent end-game defection effect for them. They do not adjust their strategy toward more selfish play when the remaining time is known to be short; if anything, they maintain or restore cooperative behavior even as others advocate defecting. There is no observable attempt to “cash out” by free-riding at the end. Their end-game response is therefore characterized by stubborn or habitual cooperation rather than strategic unraveling.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey never spend anything on rewards at any point. This holds both when they are cooperating and when they are free-riding. They also never receive any rewards from others. Their inaction regarding rewards occurs despite visible examples of others using the reward mechanism and despite some players explicitly discussing the lack of reciprocal rewarding. This pattern suggests either that they do not see reward as beneficial, or that they prioritize keeping their own coins over incentivizing others, or that they pay little attention to this institutional lever. There is no evidence that high cooperation by others triggers them to invest in rewards, nor that they use rewards strategically to build alliances. Their type is “non-rewarding,” with motivation for that choice unknown.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThey are never rewarded, so there is no direct behavioral evidence of how they respond to identifiable rewarders. They do not comment on others who do reward, positively or negatively. They also do not reciprocate reward toward those who have been generous to the group more generally. As a result, their reciprocity tendencies via rewards are unknown, and there is no sign of alliance building based on the reward mechanism.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey observe multiple patterns: some players paying substantial costs to reward, some players repeatedly free-riding and earning more than contributors, and some group-level payoff deterioration when many defect. They themselves are directly named as a non-contributor at one point, but they do not respond. They also see specific players becoming focal as free-riders (and being criticized), yet they neither join the criticism nor adjust clearly in a retaliatory way. Their only explicit reaction to outcome changes is a brief remark once the cooperative atmosphere has degraded, expressing that the enjoyable phase of the game has passed; this implies they differentiate between “fun,” more cooperative states and later, more selfish states, and that they notice the shift in group outcomes. They do not comment on payoff inequality between contributors and non-contributors, nor on the behavior of heavy rewarders. Overall, they appear observant but disengaged from sanctioning or norm-enforcement, and they accept earning less than some defectors without overt complaint or visible strategic retaliation."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a mixed, somewhat erratic conditional cooperator with a slight cooperative tilt overall. They are clearly willing to fully contribute when group cooperation seems high or normatively expected, and they repeatedly choose the full-cooperation option in such contexts. They also occasionally free-ride, including in at least one situation where group discussion emphasizes not contributing, and in at least one situation where others’ cooperation is still substantial. Their pattern suggests neither pure self-interest nor strict moral commitment: they alternate between full contribution and zero, apparently influenced by perceived norms and by short-term payoff considerations rather than a fixed strategy. They do not insist on strict fairness; they sometimes accept being more cooperative than some others and at other times take advantage of others’ contributions. Their behavior indicates moderate risk tolerance: they are willing to contribute fully even when some suggest mutual defection, but they are not consistently “high-risk altruistic” since they also hedge by defecting in some mid-to-late game rounds.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThey never speak in the chat, so their communication style is unknown. They neither attempt to coordinate nor to persuade, and there is no evidence of direct engagement with others. This passivity suggests either a preference for observational learning and silent adaptation or simple non-engagement with the social channel. Their responsiveness to others’ verbal cues can only be inferred through actions, not words; verbally, their stance is unknown.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThey are aware of the finite horizon through the game interface, but there is no direct statement from them about it. Behaviorally, they do not exhibit a pure end-game collapse: in the very last round, they choose to fully contribute despite some others openly advocating non-contribution. Earlier in the late game they do defect at least once, which aligns with typical end-game decay, but they then return to full contribution at the final decision. This mix suggests that while they recognize that the game is ending (known from the environment), they are not purely backward-inductive; they remain somewhat cooperative even at the end. Their end-game behavior is thus inconsistent: they are capable of both opportunistic defection and last-round cooperation.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey almost never use the reward option and appear highly reluctant to spend on rewarding, despite at least one instance of someone rewarding them. The one time they do reward, they spend a small positive amount, which indicates they understand the mechanism and are not dogmatically opposed to using it. However, they do not engage in broad, systematic reward of cooperators or in reciprocal reward chains; rewarding is rare and low-intensity. Their choices suggest that they view the reward mechanism as having low instrumental value under this cost/benefit structure, and they are not strongly motivated by expressive gratitude via costly reward. They do not use reward strategically to build alliances or enforce cooperation in any persistent way.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThey receive a reward early and do not overtly acknowledge it in chat (they are silent overall), and they do not clearly reciprocate to that specific rewarder in a traceable, one-to-one manner. They later reward someone else, but this appears more like a one-off action than a consistent norm of “reward those who reward me.” This points to weak or absent direct-reciprocity behavior via the reward channel. Their main “response” to being rewarded manifests more in continued willingness to contribute in cooperative phases rather than in targeted payback to the rewarding individual. Overall, their reciprocity through formal reward is minimal and inconsistent; if they reciprocate at all, it is more through general cooperation than through direct return rewards.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey observe others’ contribution patterns and payoff outcomes and clearly adjust their own contributions across rounds, but there is no direct evidence from chat of explicit evaluation (approval, blame, or moralizing). Behaviorally, they continue to contribute fully when the group is broadly cooperative, even in the presence of a few free-riders; at other times they switch to free-riding when many others also defect or when defection is being tacitly or explicitly normalized. This indicates that they are sensitive to overall group behavior and the implied norms, but not highly punitive or retaliatory—they never attempt to use reward as a countermeasure against low contributors, nor do they systematically withdraw cooperation at the first sign of defection. They accept that some members earn higher payoffs through free-riding without mounting an organized response via rewarding or sustained defection. In sum, they adapt moderately to others’ outcomes, showing weak norm enforcement and a relatively tolerant, somewhat opportunistic stance toward varying payoffs."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a calculated, opportunistic free-rider who occasionally cooperates but does not commit to any stable norm. They alternate between full contribution and full defection in a way that suggests active experimentation with payoff structures rather than moral or fairness-driven behavior. They begin by cooperating when the group appears coordinated and optimistic, but quickly show that they are willing to defect even when others are mostly or fully cooperating, capturing large private gains while still benefiting from others’ contributions. Their pattern indicates low intrinsic concern for fairness; they are comfortable taking more than their “share” when the environment allows it. They appear to understand the payoff consequences well enough to exploit high group contributions rather than treating the game naively. Their risk tolerance is moderate: they defect in socially risky moments (when cooperation is fragile), but never push that into explicit confrontation or explanation in chat. Overall, they behave as a payoff-maximizer who is willing to cooperate when convenient but defaults to self-interest once they see that others’ cooperation can be exploited.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThey are minimally communicative and socially reactive rather than proactive. They speak only a couple of times, and their contributions to chat are brief and somewhat ambiguous in tone. One remark expresses surprise at another player’s heavy use of rewards, which reads as a mixture of mild judgment or bemusement and curiosity rather than moral outrage or support. They do not make direct attempts to organize group behavior, nor do they explain or justify their own contribution choices. When others question their behavior indirectly, they do not respond. This suggests a low-engagement, low-justification style: they are aware of the social environment but do not invest effort in persuasion or reputation management. They are also not openly hostile or trolling; instead, they occupy a quiet, somewhat aloof role, letting others argue about norms and strategy while they adjust their own choices in the background.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThey show clear awareness of the finite horizon: the number of rounds is visible and referenced by others, and they are exposed to explicit “last round” talk. Their behavior late in the game, however, does not show a shift toward “cooperate for the finale”; instead, they continue to free-ride even when some others still contribute. There is no observable attempt to use the final rounds either to punish defectors (via withholding cooperation) in a principled way or to reward cooperators through their own contributions. Their end-game pattern is consistent with forward-looking self-interest rather than reciprocity or reputation building: once they recognize that coordination is unstable and others are debating whether to stop contributing, they maintain or increase their own defection. They do not comment on the approaching end directly, suggesting that horizon awareness affects their strategy but not their explicit communication.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey never spend any coins on rewards in any observed round, despite having multiple opportunities and seeing others experiment with rewarding. This strongly indicates that they either see no instrumental value in rewarding (given the technology and group behavior) or that they are unwilling to sacrifice private payoff for normative or expressive reasons. Their behavior is consistent with a simple rule: keep all reward resources for themselves, regardless of whether others contribute or reward. There is no sign that they use rewards as strategic reinforcement, as a signal of approval, or as a way to build alliances. They also do not even use small, low-cost “tokens” of reward, which suggests a robust reluctance to incur any cost for others’ benefit, at least within this incentive structure. Whether they conceptually understand reward dynamics is unknown; what is clear is that, behaviorally, they act as a strict non-rewarder.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThey receive a small, unsolicited reward early in the game, but they do not acknowledge it explicitly in chat, do not reciprocate to that specific player, and do not begin using the reward mechanism themselves afterward. This is strong evidence that they are not guided by reciprocity norms in this environment. Being rewarded does not trigger gratitude signaling, alliance formation, or even a minimal return reward. Their silence toward the rewarder also suggests low social investment: they neither thank nor criticize the rewarder, and they do not attempt to coordinate future cooperation with them. Their one notable chat remark about rewards expresses surprise at a different player’s large reward expenditure, not gratitude toward their own rewarder. Overall, they treat rewards as windfall gains rather than as part of a reciprocal relationship.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey observe others’ contributions and the use of rewards, and their limited comments focus on surprising or extreme behavior rather than moralizing about fairness. When a player spends a large amount on rewarding, they respond with brief amazement, which likely indicates that they see this as strategically or economically unusual. They do not verbally criticize defectors or praise cooperators, even when others vocally do so. Likewise, they do not join in when others complain about “greed” or “not understanding math.” Instead, they adapt their own behavior—moving toward more defection as the group becomes more fractured—without publicly aligning with either side of the emerging norm conflict. This pattern suggests that they monitor the social and outcome environment mainly to adjust their own payoff strategy, not to enforce norms or seek group harmony. They remain largely detached from others’ fortunes, neither openly gloating nor empathizing, and they do not use outcome information to build any visible coalition."

They are clearly willing to fully cooperate: they repeatedly choose the maximal contribution and continue to do so even after witnessing at least one clear defector gain higher payoffs. At the same time, they also fully defect in some rounds, including when many others defect and when free-riding is especially profitable. Their pattern suggests they are sensitive to group norms and possibly experimenting rather than strictly following a single rule.\n\nThey appear comfortable with risk in the sense of not always aligning with the majority: they fully contribute in situations where many peers call for defection, but also defect in situations with both cooperative and uncooperative behavior around them. There is no evidence that they follow a strict fairness norm such as “match the group average” or “never exploit cooperators”; instead they alternate between being a full cooperator and a free-rider.\n\nOverall, they seem responsive to the broad cooperation climate, but not in a strictly monotone way: they sometimes cooperate when others say not to, and sometimes defect when substantial cooperation is present. Their decisions fit a type that weighs both profit and the social environment but does not lock into a stable rule.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nTheir communication is sparse, reactive, and focused on clarification rather than leadership. They greet others, but they do not initiate strategy proposals about contribution or reward. When another player appears to accuse “monkey” of not contributing, they quickly defend their reputation, clarifying that they did contribute everything. This shows concern about how others perceive their contribution, and a desire not to be misclassified as a defector.\n\nBeyond this, they ask for clarification when they are confused about being addressed, indicating they pay attention to chat and care about understanding social references. They do not engage in moralizing, blaming, or directing others’ strategies, and they never join the more heated or sarcastic exchanges. Their tone is neutral to slightly defensive when their behavior is questioned, but not aggressive. They seem socially attentive yet reserved, preferring to correct misunderstandings rather than steer group norms.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThey clearly have awareness of the game horizon (the number of rounds) from the shared information and chat context, but there is no direct statement from them about the remaining rounds. Behaviorally, they do not follow a simple end-game defection logic. Even when others explicitly push for universal defection at the very end, they still fully contribute in the last round. This suggests that, at least in this setting, they do not adopt a purely backward-induction or “last-round, always defect” strategy.\n\nInstead, they seem willing to maintain or attempt cooperation even in an environment where many explicitly discuss shutting cooperation down at the end. At the same time, they defect in earlier late-stage play, so it is not that they are consistently principled; their last-round full contribution indicates either a residual cooperative inclination, confusion, or a deliberate choice to keep contributing despite the end-game incentives. Their end-game pattern is thus mixed but notably not purely self-serving.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey never spend any coins on rewarding others in any round, despite having multiple opportunities and clear examples of others using the reward mechanism. This holds even when they personally receive a small amount of reward early on. Their revealed preference is that reward is not worth the cost under these parameters, or at least not worth using given how others behave.\n\nThey also never publicly endorse or discuss reward in chat. There is no sign they use reward strategically to encourage cooperation, reciprocate kindness, or punish defectors indirectly by rewarding only cooperators. In terms of type, they act as a non-rewarder: they rely solely on contribution choices rather than secondary mechanisms to influence others.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThey receive a small reward early in the game from another player. After this, there is no observable change in their reward behavior or contributions that clearly reflects gratitude-based reciprocity. They do not start rewarding the rewarder (or anyone) afterward, and they do not comment on the reward in chat. There is no explicit attempt to build an alliance or exchange of favors with the identifiable rewarder.\n\nTheir subsequent contribution pattern (alternating between full contribution and defection) does not obviously track whether they have been rewarded or who rewarded them. This suggests that, at least in this context, they do not strongly condition on having been rewarded, either in terms of reciprocity or increased commitment to cooperation. Their response to reward is best characterized as neutral: they accept the payoff but do not change their strategic toolkit or communication because of it.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey observe all outcome information, including who contributes, who defects, and who spends on reward, but they rarely comment on it. The only clear reaction to outcome-related social information is when they are implicitly accused of not contributing; then they assert that they did contribute fully. This indicates they care about their cooperative image relative to others’ outcomes and do not want to be grouped with defectors.\n\nThey do not publicly criticize or praise players who defect or over-reward, nor do they join in group condemnation of perceived free-riders. They also do not publicly engage with others’ questions about the value of reward. Their behavior suggests a player who monitors the environment, adjusts contributions in a way that loosely tracks the group’s cooperation level, but does so quietly and without overt commentary on others’ payoffs or strategic choices. They appear more concerned with their own payoff and reputation than with norm enforcement or moral judgment of others."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a high, steady contributor who anchors close to full cooperation. They frequently give the entire endowment and otherwise hover modestly below the group average only when the general contribution climate looks weaker. They do not appear to condition sharply on small differences in others’ behavior; minor under-contribution by a few peers does not trigger strong downward adjustment. Instead, they maintain a relatively generous baseline that fluctuates within a narrow band, suggesting a blend of prosocial preference and mild strategic caution rather than strict tit‑for‑tat. They tolerate being among the top contributors even when it reduces their relative payoff, indicating low aversion to disadvantageous inequality and a willingness to absorb some exploitation if group contributions remain reasonably high. They do not escalate downward when overall contributions steadily fall; rather, they oscillate between full contribution and a moderate reduction, implying they value sustaining cooperation more than strictly maximizing short‑term earnings. Their choices do not indicate strong risk‑seeking or risk‑avoidant behavior; they stay with a simple, robust cooperative rule rather than experimenting widely.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey never use punishment despite the tool being powerful and relatively cost‑effective. This holds even when some peers contribute noticeably less or when defectors are clearly earning higher payoffs. Their nonuse appears systematic rather than situational: even in environments where a strategic punisher might try to discipline low contributors or retaliate against free riders, they refrain. This suggests either a principled aversion to harming others, skepticism about the long‑term value of punishment, or a preference to let others bear any enforcement role. There is no evidence that they use punishment for either deterrence or retaliation. Their strategy seems to omit punishment entirely, not even as a late‑game or last‑resort tool. Overall, they are a non‑punishing cooperator.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nUnknown. The player is never punished, so there is no observed reaction. Their future contributions and continued refusal to punish do not allow inference about whether they would respond to punishment with compliance, retaliation, or indifference. Any characterization here would be speculative; confidence is low.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey never spend on rewards, even though they routinely observe others investing in positive incentives. This includes frequent cases where other players reward high contributors. Their abstention is consistent across both cooperative and more defect‑prone environments, suggesting that they treat rewarding, like punishment, as outside their strategy set. This likely reflects either a strong preference to avoid spending on social tools altogether, a belief that cooperation can be sustained without explicit reinforcement, or a narrow focus on maximizing personal payoff subject to maintaining their own cooperative standard. They do not engage in alliance‑building via rewards nor do they attempt to shape others’ behavior with positive incentives.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThey receive rewards on a few occasions from others who also appear highly cooperative. Their subsequent behavior does not change discernibly: they continue to contribute at similar or slightly varying cooperative levels and still never adopt rewarding themselves. There is no indication of reciprocal rewarding or targeted favoring of those who rewarded them, even though identities are observable. This suggests that, while they may privately appreciate the rewards (unknown), they do not convert gratitude into material reciprocity. Their cooperative pattern appears driven by an internal standard rather than contingent on being rewarded.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey consistently see others’ outcomes, including payoff differences driven by varying contributions and by some players’ use of punishment and reward. They do not mimic the enforcers’ behavior, nor do they react visibly to shifting payoff ranks: even when defectors earn more, the player neither punishes nor heavily reduces contributions, and even when cooperators are supported by rewards, they do not join in reinforcing them. This points to low sensitivity to outcome inequality and to others’ sanctioning choices. They adapt their own contributions slightly to the general contribution climate, but they ignore the “second‑order” layer of who is punishing or rewarding whom and with what cost. Socially, they behave as a quietly principled cooperator: they uphold a cooperative norm for themselves, largely independent of others’ sanctioning strategies or relative earnings, and refrain from directly intervening in others’ payoffs."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a stable, unconditional full cooperator under the given parameters. They always give their entire endowment to the public fund, showing no sensitivity to fluctuations in others’ average behavior and no visible conditionality on past treatment. They act as though the socially efficient norm is full contribution and adhere to it regardless of observed free riding or mid-level contributions by others.  \n\nThey appear strongly fairness- and efficiency-oriented: the game’s high multiplier makes cooperation payoff-dominant, and their behavior aligns with prioritizing group efficiency over own short-term payoff. They do not hedge or experiment with partial or zero contributions, suggesting low concern with exploitation relative to their commitment to the cooperative norm.  \n\nTheir risk tolerance is high in social terms: they continue to expose themselves to potential exploitation by consistent cooperators with no attempt to protect themselves via reduced contributions. They seem to follow a “do the right thing and use sanctions/rewards to shape others” approach rather than adjusting their own giving.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThe player is clearly willing to spend on punishment, but their use of it is selective, pattern-based, and at times opaque. They are not a simple “punish all low contributors” type. They punish some players who appear to be behaving cooperatively and sometimes ignore clear free riders, indicating that punishment is not purely a straightforward reciprocity response to contribution levels.  \n\nThey shows no clear evidence of pure retaliation: they are themselves punished at least once but do not then directly target the likely punishers in any simple tit-for-tat fashion (though exact identities are unobserved, so this is uncertain). Instead, their punishment pattern suggests they may be experimenting with enforcing a more complex norm or testing how the sanction system works.  \n\nThey exhibit a moderate to high willingness to pay for punishment overall, suggesting they accept personal cost to attempt to shape group behavior. However, their targeting is noisy: some high contributors receive sanctions, some low or inconsistent contributors are ignored at times, and there is no stable “always punish low contributors” rule. This looks more like a “norm entrepreneur” with imperfect information or inconsistent heuristics than a purely payoff-maximizing punisher.  \n\nThey do not escalate punishment intensity dramatically when others deviate; they use small to moderate amounts per target, consistent with a preference for distributed, moderate sanctions rather than severe, focused attacks. Motives appear to mix norm enforcement with exploratory or experimental behavior; the exact internal rule is unknown and confidence in any fine-grained rule is low.\n\n<REWARD>\nThe player is highly willing to reward and often spends substantial resources on positive incentives. They reliably allocate rewards to several others, frequently to individuals who appear to contribute fully or stably. This indicates a clear tendency to positively reinforce apparent cooperators.  \n\nIn contrast to punishment, their rewards are more aligned with straightforward reciprocity and norm support: many rewarded players are strong contributors or appear to match the cooperation standard this player favors. They also repeat rewarding some names across multiple opportunities, suggesting they are building or sustaining “alliances” with reliably cooperative others, despite anonymity of who rewards whom.  \n\nThey uses reward both as gratitude and as strategic reinforcement: they spend even when there is no direct, guaranteed future payoff from those individuals, implying a preference for promoting a cooperative climate rather than narrowly maximizing their own round payoff. Their willingness to invest heavily in rewards indicates strong pro-social preferences and a belief that encouraging good behavior is at least as important as punishing bad behavior.  \n\nOverall, they fit a “pro-social enforcer with noisy sanctions”: a player who always cooperates, frequently rewards cooperators, and sometimes punishes in a way that reflects an attempt to regulate group behavior, though their punishment criteria remain partially unclear and possibly exploratory."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a high, mostly stable contributor who orients toward cooperative norms but gradually experiments with moderate self-interest. They begin by matching or exceeding the apparent cooperative standard and repeatedly choose contributions that are above the group average. Their default inclination is to treat full or near-full contribution as appropriate behavior, suggesting a fairness norm that favors strong public-good provision rather than strict payoff maximization.\n\nThey show some flexibility rather than rigid idealism: after sustaining high contributions, they occasionally lower their input while still remaining roughly in the cooperative range. These downshifts align with periods where many others contribute little or zero, indicating conditional cooperation: they are willing to support the group, but they also respond to visible free-riding by protecting their own payoff. The adjustments are modest rather than extreme, implying they tolerate some inequality and do not immediately collapse their contributions when others defect.\n\nThey appear to value efficiency and group welfare more than short-run personal earnings, given that contributing heavily is individually costly relative to the low marginal per-capita return, yet they persist with high contributions for most of the game. This points to either prosocial preferences, adherence to a “do the right thing” heuristic, or a belief that maintaining high contributions helps stabilize cooperation over time.\n\nThere is no evidence that they deliberately track or mimic any single peer; instead, they respond to the general contribution climate. Their pattern suggests they attend to the distribution of contributions (especially clear low contributors and non-contributors) and then adjust their own level within a relatively narrow band rather than oscillating wildly. Overall, they act as a robust but not unconditional cooperator: they are inclined to lead with generosity, remain cooperative under moderate disappointment, and only partially retreat from cooperation when low contributors persist.\n\nRisk tolerance regarding uncertainty about game length and others’ behavior is medium to high. They repeatedly choose actions that are locally dominated from a purely selfish standpoint, indicating willingness to risk earning less in order to sustain cooperation. However, their later reductions in contribution show that this is bounded: if the cooperative environment erodes, they hedge rather than continuing to fully sacrifice.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThis player never uses the punishment option despite repeated exposure to clear free-riding and consistently identifiable low contributors. Their willingness to punish appears effectively zero in this setting. They do not engage in targeted sanctions against persistent non-contributors or chronically low contributors, even when doing so would be relatively cheap and potentially impactful.\n\nThe absence of any punishment across varying contribution climates suggests a stable underlying disposition rather than simple oversight. At minimum, they are reluctant to impose material harm on others, even anonymous partners, and they do not use punishment as a tool to enforce fairness or reciprocity. Whether this reluctance stems from moral aversion to harming others, doubts about the effectiveness of punishment, or an instrumental desire to maximize their own payoff by avoiding the cost of sanctioning is unknown; the data only support the conclusion that they refrain entirely from punitive action.\n\nThey also never experience punishment themselves, so there is no evidence about retaliatory motives or reactions to being sanctioned. Their non-use of punishment persists despite continued cooperative behavior, which implies they are willing to absorb some exploitation by free-riders rather than pay to discipline them. This is consistent with a “cooperative non-punisher” or “tolerant cooperator” profile: they prefer to adjust their own contributions downward when necessary instead of using costly punishment to shape others’ behavior."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a steady, above-average contributor with a mild conditional component. They consistently give at least a moderate share of their endowment and often give the full amount. Once they observe that most others are contributing at or near the maximum, they match that high-cooperation norm and maintain it for most of the game. They briefly reduce their contribution when the group’s pattern becomes more mixed, suggesting they condition their behavior on the perceived reliability of others, but they quickly resume full contributions. They appear comfortable sacrificing private payoff for the public good when they believe others are also doing so. There is no evidence of opportunistic free-riding or abrupt endgame defection; they do not visibly “cash out” despite not knowing when the game ends. Their behavior fits a “pro-social conditional cooperator who defaults to cooperation” type, with moderate risk tolerance: willing to invest heavily in the group despite uncertainty about others’ future actions.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThis player never uses the punishment option, despite many opportunities and clear examples of others employing heavy sanctions on low contributors and on specific targets. They refrain from sanctioning both obvious low contributors and erratic spenders on punishment/reward. This suggests either a principled reluctance to impose losses on others, a belief that punishment is inefficient or counterproductive, or a desire to avoid escalating conflict. They also do not appear to use punishment reactively in response to changes in others’ contributions or to visible antisocial behavior by some participants. Overall, they function as a non-punishing cooperator: they contribute substantially but do not enforce norms through negative sanctions.\n\n<REWARD>\nThis player never spends on rewards, even though reward is relatively efficient in this environment and many peers actively use it. They receive rewards in several rounds but do not reciprocate with reward spending. This implies that gratitude, if felt, does not translate into costly positive reinforcement. It may also indicate a narrow efficiency focus: they may prefer to let their high contribution itself be their cooperative act, rather than layering additional costs on top. Alternatively, they might not view targeted rewarding as necessary given that the group already sustains high contributions without their intervention. In any case, they behave as a “pure contributor” who supports the public good via their own contributions only, not via incentivizing others.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThe player observes extreme and varied patterns of punishment and reward among others, including very heavy and sometimes seemingly excessive spending on sanctions and rewards by certain participants, yet they do not adjust into punishing or rewarding themselves. Nor do they visibly reduce their own contributions in protest or in response to apparent chaos or spiteful behavior by others. Their contribution path shows only minor sensitivity to the group’s changing composition and contribution levels, not to others’ payoff swings caused by sanctions. This suggests a relatively stable internal standard: they continue cooperating as long as the aggregate contribution level remains reasonably high, and they largely ignore others’ costly signaling through punishment and reward. Their lack of retaliation or reciprocal rewarding indicates they are not strongly driven by revenge, gratitude signaling, or norm-enforcement motives. Instead, they appear focused on their own contribution strategy and on the overall efficiency of cooperation, treating others’ payoff turbulence as background rather than as a cue for behavioral change."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a generally high, steady contributor who experiments briefly with free-riding but then settles into a cooperative baseline. They start at the maximum possible contribution, then oscillate among high amounts, with one clear instance of contributing nothing even when others contribute strongly. After that, they consistently choose contributions in the mid-to-high range, usually above the group average and rarely at the minimum or maximum extremes.\n\nThey appear to value group efficiency and are willing to forgo private coins to support the public good, as indicated by repeated high contributions despite the presence of low contributors and heavy norm-enforcement behavior by others. At the same time, the one free-ride episode suggests they are not a pure altruist: they test the payoff structure and learn that strong cooperation by others can be exploited without immediate consequences. Nonetheless, they do not adopt permanent free-riding; they return to substantial contributions, suggesting an internal norm of “do your part” rather than strict payoff maximization.\n\nTheir behavior is only weakly conditional on others’ contributions. Very low contributions by some players coexist with their own continued high giving. When the group is generally cooperative, they maintain or slightly adjust contributions but do not dynamically fine-tune based on specific others’ deviations. This indicates a relatively stable personal standard rather than responsive reciprocity.\n\nRisk tolerance appears moderate. They are willing to contribute high amounts even in a noisy, volatile environment with erratic punishers and rewarders. However, they avoid extreme over-contribution relative to most high contributors after the initial round, suggesting some concern about being exploited or overcommitting.\n\nFairness norms are implicit: they exhibit no systematic tendency to lower contributions in response to free-riders or to ramp up dramatically when others become more generous. This points more to a “stably prosocial but self-aware” type than to a strict equity or conditional cooperator type.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThis player never spends on punishment, despite multiple opportunities and despite clear, repeated under-contribution by some participants and dramatic punishment campaigns by others. They appear to categorically reject costly punishment as a strategy.\n\nTheir inaction persists even when they themselves are punished at low intensity on some occasions. The absence of retaliatory punishment implies they are not motivated by revenge or personal score-settling. Nor do they appear interested in using punishment to discipline free-riders or signal a norm. They tolerate both mild free-riding and extreme, arguably antisocial, punishment of others without intervening.\n\nThis suggests either a strong aversion to wasting coins on negative sanctions, a belief that others will do the punishing anyway, or skepticism that punishment is effective or justified in this setting. They may also prioritize earnings over moralistic enforcement.\n\nBecause they never punish, there is no evidence about their selectivity or threshold for imposing sanctions beyond “extremely high or effectively never.” Motivation is best described as non-punitive and non-retaliatory; any deterrence motive is either absent or too weak to overcome the personal cost.\n\n<REWARD>\nThis player also never uses the reward mechanism, despite the fact that rewards are relatively efficient compared to punishment and many others invest heavily in rewarding. They abstain even when they themselves receive rewards, indicating they do not reciprocate via the mechanism.\n\nTheir behavior suggests they do not treat the reward tool as a means of encouraging cooperation or thanking high contributors. They maintain high contributions without using positive reinforcement, indicating they rely on their own contribution standard rather than on incentivizing others.\n\nThe consistent non-use of rewards implies either a general reluctance to spend on others beyond contributions, a belief that good behavior should not require side payments, or uncertainty or disinterest about managing others’ incentives. The combination of high contributions and zero rewarding fits a “quiet cooperator” or “non-interventionist cooperator” profile: they help through their own actions but do not invest in shaping others’ behavior.\n\nThere is no evidence of strategic rewarding to build alliances, attract future favors, or nudge specific players. Their stance is effectively: contribute generously to the public good, but do not spend extra to privately subsidize or steer individuals.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThis player observes an environment where some players spend extreme amounts on punishment, others invest heavily in rewards, and some individuals are repeatedly targeted with large deductions. Throughout, they neither imitate these behaviors nor visibly adjust their own contributions in response to any specific punishment or reward patterns.\n\nThey continue to contribute at a relatively high, stable level despite seeing that:\n- Some high contributors get punished.\n- Some low contributors or erratic actors receive rewards or remain unpunished.\n- Some players drastically reduce their own earnings through aggressive punishment or generous rewarding.\n\nTheir response appears to be to ignore both the punitive and rewarding “meta-game” and focus on their own earnings via contributions and received redistribution. They do not react defensively when punished, do not “reward the rewarders,” and do not start punishing when seeing free-riders go unpunished. Nor do they shift toward free-riding in response to chaos or perceived unfairness of outcomes.\n\nThis suggests a relatively independent, non-reactive orientation: they are not strongly swayed by fairness violations in outcomes or by extreme behavior from others. They may see others’ punishment and reward expenditures as noise or self-damaging choices rather than as signals demanding a response. Their learning and adaptation are limited to the contribution level (e.g., a one-time free-ride test and adjustment toward a stable high-contribution pattern), not to the use of social control mechanisms.\n\nOverall, the persona is a “steadfast, non-interventionist cooperator”: they maintain substantial contributions to the public good, largely ignore the punishment/reward layer, accept others’ earnings and enforcement behavior without reacting in kind, and prioritize individual payoff stability and simple prosocial behavior over active norm enforcement or strategic reciprocity."

They alternate between medium and zero giving at the very start, then quickly lock into consistently contributing the full endowment in all remaining rounds, regardless of variation in others’ behavior or obvious antisocial punishment patterns in the group. This shows a strong internal norm for cooperation that is not tightly conditional on others’ contributions or on the presence of “fair” punishment/reward systems. They tolerate the risk that others may exploit their generosity, and they do not scale back their giving in response to either being punished when free-riding or seeing erratic punishment in the group later. They appear to prioritize group efficiency and personal norm-following over payoff maximization, suggesting a cooperative, possibly efficiency-oriented or rule-internalized type rather than a payoff-maximizing conditional cooperator.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThis player never uses punishment, even when there are clear opportunities to target very low contributors or highly disruptive actors. Their inaction holds across the entire game, including periods where free-riding and extreme, arguably wasteful punishment by others are visible. This strongly suggests a stable aversion to costly punishment: they neither engage in norm-enforcing sanctions nor retaliate when they themselves are punished. The lack of any switch to punishment after being targeted indicates they do not view punishment as an appropriate tool for reciprocity or deterrence. Motives appear to lean toward non-interference and payoff preservation rather than retributive justice or norm enforcement. Whether this stems from principled opposition to harming others, or from a belief that anonymous punishment is ineffective or chaotic, is unknown, but their pattern is consistent and high confidence.\n\n<REWARD>\nThis player never uses reward, despite repeated exposure to others spending substantial resources on rewarding high contributors and sometimes even low contributors. They do not reward those who match or exceed their own contribution level, nor do they reciprocate when they themselves receive rewards. This indicates that they do not adopt a “positive reinforcement” strategy, even though rewards are more efficient than punishment in this environment. Their cooperative contributions therefore do not depend on using incentives to shape others’ behavior, and they forego opportunities to express gratitude or strategically encourage allies. The decision may be driven by a preference to avoid all second-stage interventions, by a narrow payoff focus at that stage, or by skepticism that small, anonymous rewards can meaningfully coordinate behavior; which of these is primary is unknown.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThis player observes large swings in others’ payoffs driven by intense, sometimes extreme punishment and heavy reward spending, but they do not adjust either their contributions or their own use of sanctions/rewards in a reactive way. After being both punished and rewarded early, they do not retaliate, do not attempt to “win back” favor, and instead simply shift to stable high contribution while continuing to abstain from sanctioning. When some players incur massive losses by overusing punishment, this player does not mirror that behavior, punish those disruptors, or reduce contributions in protest; they appear behaviorally insulated from the surrounding turbulence. They seem to treat others’ use of punishment and reward as noise rather than as signals requiring a strategic response. This combination—strong, stable cooperation plus complete non-participation in sanctioning—suggests a type who follows their own cooperation norm, largely ignores others’ payoff dynamics, and accepts being occasionally treated unfairly without altering their strategy. Their beliefs about why others behave so erratically are unknown, but their actions imply low sensitivity to reputational or emotional triggers and a focus on maintaining a simple, internally consistent pattern rather than dynamically responding to the social environment."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a stable, moderate cooperator. After an initially low contribution, they quickly settle on a consistent mid-range amount and maintain it throughout. They neither exploit high cooperators by free-riding nor over-contribute relative to the group’s prevailing level. Their behavior suggests they value earning solid payoffs while still supporting the public good, but they avoid extreme generosity. They appear relatively insensitive to short-run fluctuations in others’ contributions, maintaining their own contribution level even when some players give very little or very much. This points to a simple, rule-like strategy (“always contribute a reasonable amount”) rather than finely tuned conditional cooperation. Their risk tolerance is moderate: they are willing to invest a substantial, but not maximal, share of the endowment in the group despite visible noise and heavy use of punishment/reward by others. A strong fairness norm is not clearly expressed through contribution adjustments; instead, they maintain their pattern regardless of others’ deviations. They likely believe that stable, moderate cooperation is a good baseline in an uncertain and somewhat chaotic environment.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey never spend on punishment despite having multiple chances and clear examples of others using it extensively and sometimes extremely. They also experience being punished themselves and still do not retaliate. This strongly suggests a type who is disinclined to use costly sanctions, either because they see punishment as inefficient, unhelpful, or not worth the trouble. They show no evidence of using punishment to enforce fairness, discipline free-riders, or retaliate for deductions directed at them. Their threshold to punish appears very high or effectively unreachable under the observed conditions. This makes them a non-punishing cooperator: they rely on their own contribution rule rather than on norm-enforcement through negative sanctions. Their deterrence motive is weak or absent, and they do not appear to participate in punishment “wars” even when others heavily target specific players. Whether this is due to principled aversion to causing losses, a purely payoff-maximizing stance, or indifference to norm enforcement is unknown.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey are willing but very selective in using rewards. They reward only a few times across the game, never using it routinely. When they do reward, it aligns with high or notably cooperative contributions, and they target multiple such contributors in one instance, suggesting they use rewards to positively reinforce desirable behavior rather than randomly. They do not reward themselves and do not seem to reward low contributors or erratic behavior, indicating some discernment about who “deserves” a bonus. The overall volume of reward is low relative to what is available, pointing toward a cautious, cost-conscious stance: they accept short-term personal cost occasionally to strengthen cooperative partners, but they are not a strong altruist or a systematic rewarder. Their initial willingness to reward a player who was sharply punished by others indicates some inclination toward supportive or compensatory gestures, but this pattern does not become a repeated theme, so whether they are motivated by empathy or simply by recognizing helpful contributors remains uncertain. They do not appear to use rewards strategically to build alliances in a targeted, repeated way, given anonymity and low frequency of use.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey observe substantial and sometimes extreme punishment and reward patterns by others but do not mimic them. They remain behaviorally conservative: stable contributions, almost no punishment, and sparse rewards despite large swings in others’ costs and payoffs. This suggests a relatively independent, low-reactivity style rather than one driven by emotional contagion or tit-for-tat responses. Being punished themselves does not lead them to lower contributions, increase punishment, or engage in countermeasures; they simply continue their established rule, indicating low propensity for retaliation and limited sensitivity to personal slights. They show some responsiveness in that they occasionally reward players whose behavior matches their cooperative expectations, but they do not escalate this even when those players continue to be active. They also do not increase contributions to “rescue” heavily punished cooperators or decrease contributions when the environment becomes chaotic; they treat others’ extreme outcomes more as background noise than as signals to overhaul their own strategy. Overall, they come across as a moderately prosocial, non-confrontational, and payoff-aware type who keeps a steady personal standard and uses positive reinforcement sparingly, while largely ignoring the punitive dynamics and payoff volatility around them."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a consistently high contributor who anchors their behavior around a “good citizen” norm rather than strict payoff maximization. They typically give well above the contemporaneous group average and never free‑ride. Their contributions are very stable, with only small deviations that still remain in the cooperative range. They appear willing to keep contributing fully even when some others give little or nothing, suggesting they prioritize sustaining a cooperative standard over short‑term protection against exploitation. There is no clear evidence that they condition their own contributions strongly on the exact pattern of others’ contributions; even when low contributors persist, they maintain high contributions. This points to a type who sees contribution as a personal obligation or identity (“I am a cooperator”) rather than a tactical response. Their behavior shows moderate risk tolerance with respect to being exploited: they accept the possibility that low contributors will benefit from their generosity, presumably because they expect social control via punishment and reward mechanisms to correct deviations.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey are an active and frequent user of punishment, with a clear focus on norm enforcement rather than personal retaliation. They systematically target clear low contributors, including zero or very low givers, and almost never punish high contributors. This reveals a strong inequality‑averse or fairness‑enforcing orientation: low contribution relative to the cooperative standard is a reliable trigger. At times they also punish moderate contributors or apparent “backsliders,” indicating that they hold a relatively demanding contribution norm and are willing to sanction even partial deviations. They rarely, if ever, use punishment on high contributors or on players who seem to be sustaining the public good, which shows some selectivity and an underlying cooperative intent. Their punishment is not minimal: they repeatedly spend substantial amounts across many decision stages, suggesting they place high weight on enforcing norms even at personal cost. There is no clear evidence of direct retaliation against those who might have punished them individually, because identities of punishers are hidden; their pattern fits a generalized social‑norm enforcer more than a reciprocal avenger. They appear to view punishment as a tool for group‑level deterrence and moral signaling: deviating downward from cooperation is met with costly sanctions to discourage future free‑riding.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey use rewards frequently but more selectively than punishment. They reward players who contribute at or near full cooperation and who seem to embody the cooperative standard they themselves follow. This includes both consistently high contributors and those who increase or maintain strong contributions over time. Their rewards are small in number compared to their punishments, implying that they treat rewarding as a complementary reinforcement mechanism rather than the primary lever of norm enforcement. They are willing to pay nontrivial costs to give extra payoffs to high contributors even when it is not obviously profitable for them individually, suggesting a preference for positively reinforcing group‑beneficial behavior. There is no strong evidence that they use reward in a narrowly strategic, coalition‑building manner; rather, they seem to reward based on observable contribution levels, not on whether a player has previously rewarded or protected them. This points to a principled “support the cooperators” stance rather than personalized reciprocity or gratitude signaling. Their pattern fits a type who tries to shape the environment with both “carrot and stick,” but whose main emphasis remains punishing low contribution.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey attend closely to both others’ contributions and the costs those others spend on punishment and reward, and they adjust their targets accordingly. They do not appear impressed or deterred by extreme spending on sanctions or rewards by some players; when others pour large amounts into sanctioning or rewarding, this does not visibly change the focal player’s own contribution level or their use of the mechanisms. Instead, they continue applying their own standard: high contributors receive occasional rewards, and low contributors are punished, regardless of how much others are already sanctioning. When some targets receive massive cumulative punishment from the group, the focal player sometimes continues to sanction them, but also at times reduces attention or shifts to other deviant contributors, suggesting they recognize when group pressure is already intense and may redirect their enforcement efforts. They do not systematically chase or protect players with extreme payoff outcomes due to others’ punishment or reward use; they remain focused on underlying contribution behavior rather than on current wealth or loss levels. Overall, they behave like a stable, norm‑driven enforcer: they respond to observed deviations in public good contributions, not to the drama of others’ payoff swings or sanctioning excesses."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a stable, unconditional full cooperator in this environment. They always contribute their entire endowment despite variability in others’ contributions and despite experiencing personal losses from others’ punishment. Their behavior reflects a strong internal norm to support the public good rather than a responsive or conditional strategy. They do not appear to condition their contribution on average group behavior, the presence of defectors, or prior payoffs; instead they maintain maximum cooperation throughout. This suggests they either prioritize efficiency and group welfare or adhere to a fairness/”do the right thing” rule that is not contingent on others. They tolerate the risk of being exploited and the reality of being punished despite cooperating, which indicates high social risk tolerance and low sensitivity to short‑term payoff shocks. There is no evidence of strategic end‑game defection or of adjusting contributions based on the pattern of free riding, so their plan appears simple, principled, and time‑invariant. Their fairness notion seems focused on “I should cooperate” more than “everyone must cooperate,” because they keep contributing fully even when some others contribute nothing.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThis player shows an initial willingness to use costly punishment selectively against a clear, extreme defector and then completely disengages from punishment afterward. Their first use of punishment targets a player who contributes nothing while many others contribute fully, which is consistent with enforcing a basic fairness norm against strong free riding. The punishment is non‑minimal and meaningfully costly, suggesting they are willing to incur real expense to sanction what they see as clear norm violations. However, they do not escalate or repeat punishment in subsequent rounds, even when low contributors or non‑contributors are present, and even after they themselves are punished. This lack of follow‑up or broader sanctioning implies they are not pursuing a systematic deterrence strategy over time. There is also no sign of retaliatory punishment; they never respond in kind when they personally receive deductions, which suggests they are either unwilling to engage in vendettas or they discount personal slights in favor of preserving resources and stability. Overall, they act as a one‑off, targeted norm enforcer rather than a consistent “peer punishment” type, and they do not appear to experiment with punishment as a strategic tool after the initial intervention. Their motives look more like enforcing a basic fairness threshold in an obvious case than like maximizing long‑run cooperation through continuous monitoring.\n\n<REWARD>\nThis player essentially does not use the reward mechanism. Despite repeatedly observing many high contributors and having the ability to reinforce their behavior at a one‑to‑one cost, they never choose to allocate positive rewards. They also do not respond with rewards after receiving small rewards themselves, so there is no evidence of reciprocal gratitude or attempt to build alliances via positive incentives. This pattern suggests either that they see cooperation as expected baseline behavior that does not merit extra compensation, or that they prioritize conserving their own payoff over using rewards as a strategic signal. It may also indicate a belief that punishment is more appropriate or more cost‑effective than reward for shaping behavior, though their limited use of punishment after the first intervention leaves this interpretation uncertain. In new environments, they are best characterized as a strong cooperator who relies primarily on personal contribution and, at most, occasional punishment of extreme free riders, not as a player who uses rewards to manage or encourage others."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a stable, unconditional full cooperator within the discrete choice options given. They always choose the maximal contribution, even when others occasionally contribute nothing, and they do not adjust their own contribution in response. Their behavior indicates a strong adherence to a cooperative norm that is insensitive to short‑term payoff disadvantages. There is no observable conditional cooperation (no downward adjustment after observing free riding), suggesting they prioritize maintaining full cooperation over reacting to others’ deviations. They tolerate the risk of exploitation and accept that some players take advantage of the public good, implying either a payoff‑irrelevant fairness norm or a belief that sustaining high group contributions is more important than sanctioning via withdrawal. Their risk tolerance regarding personal earnings is high: they repeatedly expose themselves to potential losses relative to defectors without hedging. Whether they understand the exact payoff structure is unknown, but their pattern is consistent with a “principled cooperator” type who treats contributing as the default, rule‑like action rather than a strategic choice.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThis player is clearly willing to punish and uses punishment selectively against identifiable low contributors. They ignore cooperative or near‑cooperative players and target only those who contribute nothing in a given round. Once a previously low contributor increases to full cooperation, they stop punishing that player, which indicates a deterrence or norm‑enforcement motive rather than spite or retaliation. Punishment is applied in small, single‑unit amounts rather than maximally, suggesting a calibrated approach aimed at signaling disapproval and nudging behavior rather than inflicting maximal harm. They do not engage in counter‑punishment or revenge; when they themselves are punished, their punishment pattern does not broaden or escalate, and they do not start targeting cooperators. This implies they are relatively robust to personal losses and keep their sanctioning rule focused on contribution behavior alone. Their use of punishment appears to be conditional and instrumental: it is deployed when someone free rides and discontinued when that person returns to cooperation. They show no evidence of second‑order punishment (e.g., punishing moderate contributors or those who fail to punish), but this may be unobservable in this setting; confidence on that point is low. Overall, they fit a “norm‑enforcing cooperator” profile: willing to pay a cost to discipline clear defectors, but restrained and behavior‑contingent.\n\n<REWARD>\nThis player never uses the available reward option, even though others occasionally reward them. Their lack of rewarding is not due to an absence of cooperative sentiment (since they consistently cooperate and sometimes punish free riders), but suggests they do not see costly positive reinforcement as necessary or worthwhile. They neither reciprocate rewards they receive nor systematically reward high contributors, indicating they do not prioritize gratitude signaling or relational reciprocity in this environment. Their normative tool of choice is negative rather than positive: they rely on punishment to uphold contribution norms and seem to treat cooperation itself as the expected baseline that does not merit extra compensation. Whether they would reward in richer or more transparent environments is unknown, but in this context they behave as a “non‑rewarding enforcer”: they focus resources on correcting norm violations rather than on encouraging already‑desirable behavior."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThe player is a strict, stable free-rider. They consistently contribute nothing in every decision, regardless of others’ behavior, the average contribution level, or changes in group size. Their strategy does not exhibit exploration or adjustment; it is a fixed rule rather than a reactive or conditional approach.\n\nThey appear to reason in payoff-maximizing terms given the game’s structure: the marginal per-capita return is below 1, so keeping the full endowment strictly dominates contributing from an individual-profit perspective. Their behavior aligns with a purely self-interested best response in a linear PGG without punishment or reputation consequences.\n\nThey do not follow reciprocity or fairness norms. They continue to free-ride even when others are clearly contributing very high amounts and could plausibly expect mutual cooperation. The player shows no tendency to “reward” cooperative episodes with partial giving, nor to “sanction” low-contribution periods with any change in their own behavior; they simply ignore these social signals.\n\nRisk tolerance in contribution space is effectively irrelevant for them because they never stake any coins on the public fund. This indicates either high aversion to downside risk for oneself, complete disregard for group payoffs, or both. Given that they repeatedly enjoy high returns generated by others without ever sharing costs, they are comfortable benefiting from positive externalities with no evident guilt or corrective impulse (though internal motivations are unknown).\n\nThe contribution pattern is highly stable and non-volatile: there are no switches, partial contributions, or reactive spikes. This stability suggests a pre-committed strategy (“always keep everything”) rather than trial-and-error learning. Conditional cooperation, inequality aversion, or norms of proportionality are not expressed in their actions.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThe player shows no end-game shift because their baseline behavior is already full defection. They begin with zero contributions and maintain this level through the final decision. As a result, there is no visible decay or escalation in cooperation tied to the known time horizon; their play is horizon-invariant.\n\nAwareness of the number of remaining rounds does not alter their strategy in any detectable way. Since they never cooperate at any point, they have no cooperative posture to unwind as the end approaches, nor do they attempt any last-round exploitation spike (they are already exploiting the group from the outset).\n\nFrom an inferential standpoint, this is consistent with a belief that contributing is never privately optimal, regardless of stage in the game, and that others’ tendencies to contribute can be treated as an exogenous resource to harvest rather than a pattern to cultivate or preserve. Whether they consciously model others as potentially reacting to their free-riding is unknown, but their unchanging strategy implies low concern for sustaining future cooperation.\n\nIn new PGG environments with similar incentives and no effective sanctions or reputational mechanisms, this player type is expected to defect from the start and stay that way, independent of remaining rounds or observed shifts in group behavior."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a consistent free-rider who never contributes to the public fund, regardless of others’ behavior. Their contribution pattern is perfectly stable: they always keep their entire endowment. They do not condition their behavior on peers’ actions; they continue to free-ride both when at least one other player cooperates and when no one contributes. There is no observable attempt to reciprocate cooperation or to match others’ levels, and no observable shift over time, so learning or updating of norms is unknown. They appear to prioritize individual payoff over collective efficiency, in line with narrow self-interest. Any fairness norm beyond “take what you can” is not evident; if they have such norms, they do not act on them. Their risk attitude regarding social sanctions is unclear, but they continue to free-ride even after being punished, suggesting either low sensitivity to punishment, skepticism that cooperation would improve their outcome, or a belief that others will still not coordinate on sustained cooperation. Their willingness to benefit from others’ contributions without contributing themselves indicates comfort with asymmetric outcomes.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nNo chat or explicit communication is present in the transcript, so their verbal style, attempts at coordination, persuasion, or responsiveness are unknown. Given their behavioral pattern—never contributing, never using available sanctioning tools—they behave as a silent, non-engaging type in strategic terms: they do not send any positive or negative signals via actions beyond the baseline choice to free-ride. Whether this reflects a deliberate low-engagement social style or simply a payoff-focused strategy is unknown.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey never use punishment, even when they are clear targets of punishment themselves and even when at least one peer is contributing while another is free-riding. This suggests a strong reluctance to incur personal cost to sanction others. They do not retaliate against punishers, do not punish non-contributors, and do not use punishment to try to induce cooperation. From observed choices, they appear to treat punishment as an unattractive investment, even though it has relatively high impact per unit cost. This points to a type that either (a) focuses narrowly on immediate personal payoff and avoids all costly enforcement, or (b) possibly doubts the effectiveness of punishment in coordinating behavior. Moralistic or norm-enforcing motives are not behaviorally expressed. Their threshold for punishing, if it exists, remains unknown but apparently not met even under clear free-riding by others and personal losses from sanctions.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey never use the reward option, including when another player contributes while they themselves free-ride. They show no willingness to spend resources to encourage or acknowledge cooperative behavior. Strategic reinforcement of contributors, gratitude signaling, or attempts to build a cooperative reputation via rewards are absent. Given the 1:1 efficiency of reward in this setting, their refusal to reward suggests a strong preference against sacrificing any own payoff for social or strategic benefits. They do not use rewards to differentiate between cooperative and non-cooperative peers. Thus, they behave as a purely self-regarding type in terms of positive incentives: if they value reciprocity, warm glow, or long-run cooperation, this is not revealed in their actions, and any such preferences remain unknown."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThe player fits a “quiet, profit‑maximizing free rider with occasional conformity” type. Their baseline is to keep almost all of their endowment and contribute minimally, even when others contribute fully and explicitly advocate universal giving. They do not match the prevailing norm of full contribution and never sustain high contributions across time. Their contributions fluctuate between very low and moderate levels rather than converging on a stable pattern, suggesting opportunistic experimentation rather than a principled norm.\n\nThey clearly prioritize individual payoff over group efficiency: they repeatedly choose contribution levels that maximize their private returns in the given environment, even when a stable, high‑contribution norm is visible and reinforced in chat. Occasional higher contributions appear sporadic and are not tied to any expressed reasoning or explicit coordination, so their underlying decision rule is unknown; however, those higher contributions do not persist when they see that others continue contributing high amounts regardless of their own behavior.\n\nThey show no visible fairness norm: they regularly contribute far less than the group while benefiting from others’ generosity, without any evident attempt to “make up for it” later or to track proportionality. Their risk tolerance regarding potential social sanctions is high; they free ride openly in the presence of identifiable partners and critical chat but do not adjust towards more cooperative behavior in response to social pressure alone.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThe player remains completely silent in chat throughout the game. They neither defend their low contributions nor attempt to justify or explain themselves. They ignore explicit appeals to cooperate, ignore light shaming, and do not respond to attempts to build a sense of group solidarity. This points to an avoidant or non‑engaging communication style: they do not use verbal channels for coordination, signaling, or reputation management.\n\nBecause they never speak, their sensitivity to social approval, guilt, or shame is unknown; what is observable is that they do not act to manage others’ impressions via communication. They also pass up the opportunity to influence others’ behavior through persuasion, even though others are clearly using chat to try to maintain cooperation. This suggests they rely on unilateral payoff optimization and are not inclined to invest effort in social influence.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThe player appears aware of the finite horizon but does not display a clear change in strategy at the very end: they already free ride heavily for much of the game, and they continue to do so near and at the end. There is no visible late‑game “collapse” in cooperation on their part, because they never commit to a high‑cooperation regime long enough for a decay pattern to emerge.\n\nThey do not respond behaviorally to others’ references to the game being almost finished in any distinctive way; their contribution stays low even as the game closes. Thus, any sophisticated end‑game reasoning about backward induction is hard to distinguish from their standing tendency to free ride. At minimum, they do not use the final rounds to reciprocate past generosity or repair norms; they maintain the same low‑communication, low‑contribution stance through to the last round.\n\n<REWARD>\nThe player never pays to reward anyone, despite being repeatedly exposed to a group where others are contributing generously and where the reward technology is clearly explained. They forgo rewarding even when they personally benefit a great deal from others’ high contributions and when reward could theoretically help sustain the cooperative norm that advantages them.\n\nThis indicates a strong reluctance to incur personal cost for prosocial signaling or norm support. They do not use rewards strategically to encourage others, to build alliances, or to express gratitude. Whether this is due to not valuing social reciprocity, not seeing reward as effective, or simply maximizing short‑term payoff is unknown; the only clear pattern is a consistent refusal to sacrifice coins for others’ benefit via reward.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThe player receives rewards from others at least twice but does not change their contribution pattern in a clearly cooperative direction afterward. They also do not reciprocate by rewarding in return, nor do they verbally acknowledge being rewarded. This implies very weak observable reciprocity: being rewarded does not trigger sustained higher contributions, does not elicit counter‑reward, and does not prompt any social signaling of appreciation.\n\nTheir internal beliefs about rewarders are unknown, but behaviorally they treat received rewards as windfall gains rather than as part of a reciprocal relationship. They do not appear to engage in alliance building or reputation dynamics; even with identifiable rewarders, they continue to act primarily as an individual profit maximizer rather than as a partner responding to targeted kindness."

This pattern is completely stable: there is no experimentation, no conditionality on others’ behavior, and no visible adjustment to changes in group contribution levels or punishment intensity. They behave as if the only relevant incentive is the immediate private payoff from keeping all coins, ignoring both efficiency gains from cooperation and any informal norm that contributors might be trying to establish. They do not appear to adopt fairness norms such as matching the group average or reciprocating high cooperation; they take full advantage of others’ generosity regardless of how cooperative or punitive the environment becomes. Risk tolerance regarding social sanction is high: they continue to free-ride despite being repeatedly and heavily punished, suggesting either a deliberate willingness to absorb sanctions as a “cost of doing business” or a disregard for norm enforcement.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nunknown. There is no observable chat content from this player in the transcript, so their tone, persuasion style, and responsiveness in communication are not inferable. It is unknown whether they attempt to justify free-riding, to coordinate, or simply remain silent. Engagement vs avoidance style in chat is therefore unknown.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThis player shows no discernible end-game shift. Their strategy is static: they free-ride from the beginning through the final round without any increase in contributions or strategic change as the horizon approaches. Even when the game nears its end, they do not attempt to “repair” relations with contributors, avoid punishment by briefly conforming, or exploit a final-round “grab” (they are already maximally grabbing from the start). This suggests they behave as if each round is independent or as if the only relevant consideration is short-run private income, not dynamic reputation or future consequences. They show awareness of neither cooperation decay nor last-round coordination; their pattern is flat and unresponsive to the game’s remaining length.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThis player never uses the punishment mechanism at all. Across all rounds, they spend nothing on punishing others despite facing sustained and often severe punishment themselves. They do not retaliate against those who are likely punishing them, do not try to discipline low contributors (there are others contributing zero in some periods), and do not use punishment strategically to deter future sanctions or shape group behavior. This indicates a strong reluctance or refusal to incur personal cost for norm enforcement, even when such enforcement might increase their own future payoffs by encouraging cooperation or reducing targeted punishment on them. Their motives appear purely payoff-maximizing in the short run: they avoid any costly social action, whether “prosocial” (punishing defectors) or “antisocial” (retaliating), and accept being the target rather than spending to fight back. From a type perspective, they act as a non-punishing, non-enforcing free-rider who does not invest in any form of costly sanctioning.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThis player’s behavior appears strikingly insensitive to others’ outcomes. They keep free-riding even as cooperative players suffer from heavy punishment by others, even as overall cooperation levels fluctuate, and even as their own payoff is repeatedly reduced by deductions. They do not seem to condition on who is being punished or rewarded; they do not respond when contributors are targeted, nor when other free-riders exist, nor when punishment intensity or focus changes across group members. There is no observable attempt to exploit shifts in who is being sanctioned, no strategic mimicry of higher earners, and no adaptation when their own earnings fall substantially due to punishment. This suggests either that they are not paying attention to the rich feedback about others’ payoffs and sanction patterns, or that they notice but discount it heavily relative to the simple rule “contribute nothing.” Their type can thus be characterized as a rigid, payoff-focused free-rider who neither learns from nor strategically reacts to others’ contributions, punishments, or resulting payoffs."

They appear unconcerned with fairness norms around proportional giving, and they show no evidence of sacrificing own coins for efficiency or group benefit. Risk tolerance regarding social backlash is high; they persist in full defection despite recurrent punishment from others, suggesting they either discount the likelihood or severity of retaliation, or they value their chosen stance more than the cost imposed on them. There is no sign of conditional cooperation or reciprocity on the contribution dimension.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nUnknown. There is no chat content in the transcript, so their tone, persuasion attempts, and responsiveness in explicit communication are not observable. Their interactional style must be inferred behaviorally: they remain behaviorally unresponsive to whatever norms or expectations others implicitly express through high contributions and repeated punishment, which is consistent with a low-communication or non-coordinative stance, but this is speculative (low confidence).\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThey show no end-game decay in cooperation because they never cooperate at any point; contribution behavior remains at zero throughout. Their punishment behavior, however, remains active and sometimes intensive even in the final phase, rather than tapering off. They continue to spend nontrivial amounts on punishment, including in the last rounds, indicating they remain engaged with norm enforcement or retaliation until the very end rather than switching to a purely payoff-maximizing “take and ignore” strategy. They appear horizon-aware in the sense that the game length is visible, but they do not reduce punishment intensity toward the end; if anything, they are willing to make very costly punishment choices late, suggesting they prioritize expressing disapproval, retaliating, or enforcing their own norms over maximizing final earnings.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey are a heavy and persistent user of costly punishment while simultaneously being a full free-rider. They frequently spend substantial portions of their payoff punishing others, sometimes to the point of drastically lowering their own round earnings. This indicates that they are not payoff-maximizing in a narrow monetary sense; they accept significant personal cost in order to impose losses on others.\n\nTheir targeting is not fully inferable, but some patterns are plausible (medium to low confidence):\n- They repeatedly face punishment from others, yet they continue punishing in subsequent rounds, suggesting a strong retaliatory or spiteful component: they are willing to escalate or sustain punishment conflicts rather than de-escalate.\n- They appear to direct punishment at both low contributors and high contributors at different times (inferred from changes in others’ deductions and from the fact that they never contribute themselves). This suggests that their punishment is not driven by a standard “pro-social” norm of punishing defectors on behalf of cooperation, but more by personal grievances, perceived slights, or idiosyncratic norms.\n- They sometimes punish very heavily in rounds where others are contributing generously, which is inconsistent with classic altruistic punishment and more consistent with anti-social punishment or vendetta-like behavior.\n\nOverall, they function as an anti-social punisher: they do not cooperate yet are willing to pay materially to harm others. Their punishment does not appear to be used strategically to increase future cooperation—the group remains highly cooperative without any contribution from them, and their own behavior does not change—so deterrence of defection is unlikely to be their primary motive. Instead, motives likely include retaliation against those who punish them, expression of hostility, or an attempt to reduce others’ relative advantage.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey are repeatedly punished by others, sometimes quite heavily, but do not adjust their free-riding in response, indicating low responsiveness to social sanctions in terms of contributions. Instead of conforming, they answer sanctions with continued or escalated punishment spending, consistent with a reactive or vengeful stance: when others’ outcomes show that someone has invested in punishing, they are more likely to keep engaging in the punishment environment rather than withdraw.\n\nThey also seem sensitive to relative payoffs: they often choose to sacrifice their own earnings in order to reduce others’ payoffs, even in rounds where others are doing well and contributing a lot, which suggests some concern with not letting others “get ahead” uncontested. However, they do not alter their own cooperative behavior to improve group outcomes; their response channel is almost exclusively punitive rather than constructive. Thus, when they observe others receiving high payoffs from cooperation, their typical adjustment is to impose monetary harm, not to join the cooperative pattern.\n\nIn sum, their behavioral type combines strict free-riding with active, sometimes extreme, punishment use that is not clearly aligned with cooperative norms, and a notable resistance to learning or adjusting in response to others’ sanctioning behavior."

They are willing to let others bear all the contribution cost and simply collect the redistributed benefit when available. When others stop contributing, they still do not change course, indicating that they value maximizing their own short-term payoff per round over any group-efficiency or fairness concerns. Risk tolerance regarding future group retaliation is irrelevant here because punishment/reward is disabled; within this environment they behave as if there is no strategic cost to being blatantly selfish.\n\nOverall, their type aligns with a payoff-maximizing, non-cooperative defector who does not condition on others’ past or current contributions.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThere is no discernible end-game shift in strategy because the player defects from the very beginning and maintains that strategy through to the very last round. Awareness of the remaining rounds does not visibly alter their behavior; they do not “coast” into defection after early cooperation because cooperation never occurs at all.\n\nIf anything, the consistent refusal to contribute, even when others continue to do so late in the game, suggests that they treat every round as an independent opportunity to free-ride rather than part of a broader relational or reputational horizon.

Likewise, when others also defect and their relative advantage disappears, they still do not contribute to restore higher joint payoffs. This suggests they either prioritize absolute self-payoff over group efficiency and equality, or they are indifferent to both others’ payoffs and the collective surplus, focusing narrowly on keeping their own endowment each round. Their beliefs about others’ motives and preferences are unknown; all that is observable is a consistent lack of behavioral response to social or payoff information."

Their non-use of punishment holds even when doing so might plausibly deter further sanctions, indicating either indifference to strategic deterrence or low confidence/engagement with the punishment mechanism.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nWhen others impose substantial and repeated punishment on them, they do not change their contribution behavior and do not respond with counter-punishment. They show no observable retaliation, no attempt at appeasement through increased cooperation, and no sign of “teaching” punishers a lesson. They simply absorb the deductions and persist in free-riding. This pattern suggests a combination of stubbornness and narrow focus on their chosen strategy. They may interpret punishment as a cost of doing business rather than as a signal to adjust; alternatively, they may not track or integrate social feedback into their decision rule. Their stance toward specific punishers—resentful, indifferent, or resigned—is unknown, but behaviorally they are non-retaliatory and non-compliant.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey consistently observe that most others contribute substantially, often fully, and that these others also incur significant costs punishing defectors. They also see that some low-contributors receive heavy deductions similar to their own. Despite this, they neither move toward the cooperative norm nor join in sanctioning. They appear unmoved by others’ sacrifices for the public good or by the efficiency losses caused by the punishment system. Other players’ lower payoffs from spending on punishment do not tempt them into changing roles; they do not exploit punishers differently, nor do they attempt to align with them. Overall, they treat others’ outcomes—whether those are high cooperative payoffs or reduced payoffs from bearing punishment costs—as background information, not as guidance. Their learning from social outcomes is minimal or absent, and they maintain a stable, individually rational but socially exploitative strategy."

They always keep their entire endowment and never contribute to the public fund, even when nearly all other players contribute fully and cooperation is clearly profitable at the group level. Their behavior shows no sign of conditional cooperation: they do not increase contributions in response to others’ high contributions, nor do they adjust when some others start free-riding as well. They appear strongly payoff-maximizing at the individual level, prioritizing their own immediate returns over group efficiency or fairness. There is no visible concern for matching others’ behavior or for appearing fair, despite repeated, targeted punishment against them. Across the game they show no volatility in contribution decisions, indicating a fixed, prior strategy rather than ongoing experimentation or risk-driven adjustment. Their risk tolerance with respect to social sanctions seems high: they accept substantial deductions without changing their contribution behavior, implying they either discount social disapproval or judge that continued free-riding still serves their interests better than cooperating.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThis player never uses the punishment mechanism. They refrain from punishing even when they are repeatedly and heavily punished, and even when clear free-riders besides themselves emerge. This suggests a strong reluctance to incur personal cost to sanction others, whether for norm enforcement or retaliation. There is no evidence of targeted punishment aimed at defectors, nor any symbolic or emotional “reply” to prior punishers. Their stance is thus both non-norm-enforcing and non-retaliatory. The pattern is consistent with a strategy of minimizing personal costs, including the costs of punishing, and accepting whatever sanctions others impose rather than engaging in costly conflict. Whether they see punishment as illegitimate, inefficient, or simply not worth the expense is unknown, but in practice they behave as a pure non-punisher.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nWhen others punish them, this player does not change their contribution behavior or begin punishing in return. They absorb even strong and repeated sanctions without any observable shift in strategy. There is no evidence of direct retaliation toward identifiable punishers, indicating either emotional detachment, deliberate restraint, or a purely calculative stance that deems retaliation not worthwhile. They also do not “comply” with the social signal that high contributors and punishers are sending; their contributions remain at zero despite escalating or persistent punishments. Overall, their response style is passive and unreactive: they neither seek reconciliation nor revenge, and they do not adapt in a cooperative direction in response to being targeted.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThis player observes that most others often contribute fully and that many invest substantial amounts in punishing non-contributors, yet they do not appear to imitate or reciprocate those cooperative or norm-enforcing choices. Others’ reduced payoffs due to high punishment spending, as well as the heavy deductions imposed on defectors (including themselves), do not induce them to join the cooperative norm or to participate in joint sanctioning. They seem to treat others’ outcomes—both high cooperative payoffs and costly punishment behavior—as background conditions rather than as signals that alter their plan. There is no evidence that they reward or “reward-by-not-punishing” anyone based on high contributions; they simply ignore outcome differences and continue maximizing their own short-term take. Whether they interpret others as altruistic, vengeful, or irrational is unknown, but behaviorally they remain indifferent to others’ payoffs and costs, focusing narrowly on their own consumption and accepting the externalities created by others’ punishment decisions."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a pure free-rider. They always keep their entire endowment and never contribute to the public good, despite consistently high contribution levels from most others and a relatively high marginal per capita return. Their behavior is extremely stable and shows no experimentation or conditional cooperation: they do not increase contributions when others are generous, nor do they respond to being heavily punished by changing contribution behavior. Fairness and reciprocity norms appear to have no observable influence on their choices; maximizing own private payoff from the stage game seems to dominate. They tolerate substantial social and monetary risk (including very large deduction attacks) without altering their zero-contribution strategy, suggesting either a strong commitment to free-riding, indifference to social approval, or a belief that adjustment would not sufficiently change others’ behavior. Their pattern is consistent with a rational, payoff-focused defector who treats the public account purely as an opportunity to exploit others’ cooperation.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey never spend any resources on punishment, even when they are a clear target of intense and repeated deductions and could seek to retaliate or deter future attacks. This absence holds regardless of who contributes how much or who is punished or rewarded by others. There is no sign of norm-enforcing punishment, strategic punishment to shape others’ contributions, or revenge-type punishment in response to harm. This suggests either a strong aversion to sacrificing own payoff for norm enforcement, or a belief that punishment is ineffective or not worth the cost. They accept being punished as a cost of their free-riding strategy rather than attempting to counter-punish or discipline low contributors, indicating they do not see themselves as a norm enforcer and place minimal weight on reciprocity-in-kind, even in negative form.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey never reward anyone, despite consistently high contributions from many group members and extensive reward activity by others. They do not use reward to encourage cooperators, to signal gratitude, or to build alliances or goodwill that might protect them from punishment. The reward technology is relatively efficient, but they still refrain from ever using it, suggesting that any value they place on others’ welfare, reciprocity, or strategic reputation-building is outweighed by their desire to conserve own payoff each round. They do not appear to adopt a “carrot-and-stick” strategy at all; instead, they ignore the reward channel and treat others’ rewarding behavior as irrelevant for their own actions.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey are repeatedly punished and occasionally rewarded but exhibit no observable behavioral adaptation: contributions remain at zero and their use of punishment and reward remains at zero throughout. Massive deduction episodes directed at them do not change their strategy, implying either a very strong commitment to their initial plan, low sensitivity to social sanctions, or skepticism that changing would improve their longer-term outcome. They also do not copy or respond to others’ heavy use of punishment or generous reward; the variability and sometimes extreme spending by others does not trigger imitation or counter-behavior. They appear to treat others’ payoffs, punishment costs, and reward costs as background information rather than as signals to integrate into their decisions. Overall, they behave as a rigid, self-focused defector type: they free-ride regardless of group norms, do not invest in influencing others, and do not update in response to social or monetary feedback from the group."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThe player is a strict, consistent free-rider. They always withhold their entire endowment and never deviate, indicating a stable, non-conditional strategy rather than experimentation or noise. They behave as if they have fully internalized that their individual marginal return from contributing is lower than keeping their endowment, and they act to maximize own payoff regardless of group benefit.\n\nThey show no apparent reciprocity: their contributions do not increase when others contribute more, nor do they decrease when others contribute less. This suggests they either do not hold a fairness norm of “matching” others, or they deliberately override it in favor of self-interest. They appear comfortable earning systematically higher payoffs than many cooperators, implying low concern for inequality when it benefits them.\n\nTheir risk tolerance in this context is oriented toward guaranteed personal earnings. They do not “invest” in the public good even when it is clearly producing high returns for the group, indicating a preference for the sure private payoff over any uncertain indirect benefit (such as future norm shifts or reciprocal cooperation) that might arise from contributing. There is no evidence of learning toward cooperation; instead, they exhibit a stable, payoff-maximizing, defecting profile throughout.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThe player regularly observes that many others contribute while they do not, yet they persist in free-riding. This implies that seeing others obtain lower payoffs as a consequence of contributing does not induce them to adjust toward more cooperative behavior. They appear indifferent to the fact that cooperators often earn less than they do, and they do not attempt to “correct” this through voluntary contributions.\n\nBecause no punishment or reward options exist, there is no direct behavioral evidence of how they would spend resources to alter others’ payoffs. However, from their unwavering non-contribution despite clear group provision, it is reasonable (though low confidence) to infer that they are unlikely to incur personal costs to help norm-enforce cooperation or to compensate others. They seem to accept and exploit a setting where others’ contributions raise the group return and their own payoff without imposing any obligation to reciprocate.\n\nOverall, they respond to others’ outcomes primarily by maintaining a strategy that preserves their relative advantage: they continue to free-ride even when this means others repeatedly bear the cost of generating the public good. Any emotional or moral reactions remain unknown, but behaviorally they act as a payoff-focused self-interested defector who does not adjust in response to observed inequality or collective losses."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a highly stable, near-unconditional high contributor. They overwhelmingly choose the maximum possible contribution and maintain this choice across almost the entire game, with a single, isolated deviation where they keep their full endowment for themselves and then immediately revert to full contributions thereafter. This pattern suggests that their default policy is “always contribute fully,” rather than finely tuning their behavior to momentary payoff changes.\n\nThey appear willing to contribute at high levels even when others’ average contributions are relatively low and volatile. They do not systematically match the group’s average, nor do they visibly punish low contributors by reducing their own contribution after seeing free-riding. Instead, they continue to put in the maximum, indicating low sensitivity to short-term exploitation risk and a high tolerance for contributing in mixed groups that include defectors.\n\nTheir contributions track more with a social or efficiency norm (“it is good to fully contribute”) than with strict reciprocity to individual others. They do not selectively respond to particular peers’ changes in contributions; when others fluctuate between low and high cooperation, this player’s contribution remains essentially constant. The brief instance of zero contribution does not trigger a lasting strategic shift, which suggests either an experiment with self-interest, a momentary test of what happens if they free-ride, or a short-lived reaction to previous low group contributions. Since they promptly return to maximal giving and then stay there, the most consistent interpretation is that they identify as a cooperator and regard the deviation as an exception rather than a new rule.\n\nThey show no sign of gradually decaying contributions as the game progresses. High contributions persist through early, middle, and late phases despite significant variation in the group’s behavior. This indicates strong internal cooperation norms and low volatility: they neither escalate nor withdraw in a tit-for-tat manner, and they do not chase the profit-maximizing individual strategy of persistent low contribution despite having enough opportunities to reconsider.\n\nTheir fairness norms appear to favor collective efficiency over strict payoff equality. They continue to invest heavily even in the presence of repeat low contributors, which implies they accept some inequity in individual payoffs if the group output stays reasonably high. Risk tolerance is high in social terms: they accept being exploited by free riders rather than adopting defensive defection. From the perspective of classic PGG typologies, they most closely resemble a “strong altruistic cooperator” or “norm-driven unconditional cooperator” with only very limited and quickly reversed experimentation with defection.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nAwareness of the game horizon does not meaningfully erode this player’s cooperation. Across the late portion of the game, including the final rounds, they continue to contribute the maximum amount. There is no visible “end-game unraveling” where they reduce contributions as the remaining number of rounds shrinks. Instead, their cooperative stance is maintained right through the final decision.\n\nThey do not attempt to exploit the group in the final round by dropping their contribution, even though doing so would be individually profitable and cannot be punished or rewarded in future interactions. This suggests that their strategy is not based on backward induction about future payoffs, but on a more time-invariant rule or internal standard (“I contribute fully in this kind of game”). Their behavior is consistent with a player who either does not prioritize horizon-based optimization or who values maintaining a cooperative identity or principle more than capturing the one-shot gain from late defection.\n\nThe absence of contribution decay near the end of the game also indicates that they either do not expect others to massively defect in the final rounds, or, if they do, they still choose to cooperate despite that expectation. In either case, the looming end does not shift them into a more self-interested mode. They remain a stable, high contributor from start to finish, with no systematic end-game adjustment beyond ordinary payoff fluctuations caused by others’ changing behavior."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThe player is a one-shot full cooperator in this setting. With only a single interaction and no future rounds, they still give their entire endowment to the group, indicating strong pro-social or efficiency-oriented motives that override narrow self-interest. Their cooperation is unconditional within the observed game: they commit fully without first testing or conditioning on others’ behavior. This suggests a default norm of high cooperation rather than a cautious or retaliatory approach. They appear willing to accept personal risk of exploitation; the contribution choice is strongly altruistic or rule-following, not payoff-maximizing in a strictly individual sense. Views about fairness are not directly expressed, but the action is consistent with an internal standard that favors maximal group benefit. Because only one decision is observed, stability over time and responses to changing group behavior remain unknown or low confidence.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThe player’s communication is minimal but polite. They join the social exchange after others have already greeted each other, adding a brief, friendly message that aligns with the informal tone of the group. This indicates some willingness to engage socially and acknowledge others, but they do not attempt to lead, coordinate contributions, or discuss strategies. They neither persuade nor pressure others, and they show no visible frustration or approval toward specific contribution levels. Their style is low-key, cooperative, and lightly affiliative: they signal presence and goodwill without seeking attention or control. Responsiveness is limited, and there is no evidence of them adapting their messages to specific individuals or to the unfolding contribution information.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThe game is explicitly finite and short, yet the player does not exhibit end-game defection; instead, they choose maximal cooperation in the only available round. This suggests that awareness of the horizon does not push them toward self-interested withdrawal. There is no observed change in behavior over time, so patterns of cooperation decay or escalation cannot be inferred beyond this single instance. Their type in end-game contexts appears to prioritize cooperative norms or group welfare over final-round exploitation, but whether they would maintain this in longer games with visible trends is unknown."

They always choose the maximal contribution and never deviate to free ride, despite repeated exposure to profitable defection by others. Their strategy is extremely stable over time, with no evidence of conditional cooperation or retaliatory defection. They appear to follow a simple heuristic that full contribution is the individually and collectively best response and stick to it regardless of others’ behavior. They tolerate systematic unfairness: they persist in contributing even when some group members consistently take more than they give. This suggests either strong pro-social or norm-following motives, or a belief-based commitment to the idea that “the math” favors cooperation that overrides short-term payoff comparisons. There is no detectable risk aversion in the social sense—they accept being exploited by low contributors and do not hedge by adjusting their own contributions.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThey communicate sparsely but purposefully. Early on, they explicitly state their intention to always contribute fully and justify it with a simple efficiency rationale, indicating both understanding of the payoff structure and a willingness to share their rule with others. Later they briefly react with light humor to the ongoing chat, showing that they are attentive, socially engaged, and not emotionally hostile toward defectors. Near the end, when others share their accumulated totals, they respond with their own, signaling openness and willingness to reveal outcomes. They do not try to shame, threaten, or pressure low contributors; nor do they join in insults. Their style is calm, mildly humorous, and cooperative rather than confrontational. They do not heavily coordinate or lead, but they do make at least one clear, normative statement in favor of full cooperation.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThey show no end-game defection. Their contribution pattern does not decay as the horizon approaches; they continue to fully contribute through the final round. They acknowledge the game’s finite nature indirectly by engaging with discussion about total earnings near the end, but this awareness does not alter their strategy. When others start talking about “final round” demonstrations or about switching to zero, they do not adjust; they remain consistent with their original cooperative rule. This indicates that their contribution heuristic is not primarily driven by short-term, last-round optimization or by conditional reciprocity; instead it reflects a stable principle that holds even when defection would be strategically safe and norm-conforming.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey show no explicit emotional or strategic reaction to the fact that free riders consistently earn more per round and accumulate substantial totals. They do not complain about unfairness, do not call out specific low contributors, and do not reference others’ payoffs except to share their own when asked. There is no attempt to punish through reduced contributions, nor any suggestion that others’ higher earnings change their own behavior. Their limited comments suggest that they understand that full contribution “maximizes” in some sense, but they do not explicitly reconcile this with the observed payoff asymmetries. Overall, they appear outcome-tolerant: they accept that others may exploit the public good without letting that alter their own cooperative stance, and they neither reward nor sanction others beyond implicit encouragement via their own example."

They always contribute their full endowment, and this pattern does not change in response to others’ free-riding or partial cooperation. Their behavior suggests a strong internalized norm that “everyone always contributing” is the proper or optimal arrangement, and they personally adhere to it even when it is not payoff-maximizing for them individually.\n\nThey appear to reason in terms of group efficiency rather than individual gain: they explicitly link universal contribution to maximizing collective and individual payoffs. They do not display strategic retaliation or strategic withdrawal of contributions when others defect; instead, they maintain cooperation despite clear evidence that some players systematically benefit more by not contributing.\n\nConditional cooperation is not strongly expressed: their contributions do not decrease when others fail to cooperate, even after repeated evidence of this pattern. This implies low responsiveness of their contribution level to social disappointment or exploitation. Risk tolerance for being exploited is high: they keep acting cooperatively despite repeated instances where doing so leaves them with lower payoffs than some defectors.\n\nThey hold a fairness norm centered on mutual contribution: they verbally reference an expectation that everyone should contribute, showing that equal participation is part of their fairness ideal. However, they do not convert that fairness expectation into strategic sanctions or self-protective defection. Instead, they separate “what should happen” (universal cooperation) from their own actual behavior (always cooperate), even when others violate the norm.\n\nOverall, they can be characterized as a norm-driven, group-efficiency-oriented cooperator who prioritizes stable full contributions over adaptive payoff-maximizing or retaliatory strategies.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nTheir communication style is brief, friendly, and oriented toward coordination and clarification rather than confrontation. They greet others, engage positively with cooperative proposals, and introduce or reinforce the idea that universal contribution leads to better outcomes. They also show interest in understanding the game’s structure (e.g., duration), which indicates a reflective and somewhat analytical stance, but they do not translate this into more complex strategy.\n\nThey try to guide the group toward a cooperative equilibrium by explicitly endorsing full contribution as the best option and by aligning themselves verbally with that norm. However, their persuasion is soft and non-authoritarian: they express expectations and agreement rather than issuing demands or calling out specific non-cooperators.\n\nThey show mild, non-aggressive disappointment when actual behavior diverges from the previously stated cooperative norm, but the tone stays neutral to polite and does not escalate into blame or shaming. Their engagement is selective but responsive: they answer or build on others’ cooperation-focused comments and questions, and they acknowledge group-oriented suggestions. They do not initiate complex plans or repeated lobbying; instead, they make a few key norm-affirming statements and then rely on others to follow.\n\nOverall, their communication reflects a cooperative, consensus-seeking personality: they attempt light coordination, emphasize mutual benefit, avoid direct criticism, and remain engaged but not domineering in the chat.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey clearly attend to how others behave and what payoffs result, as shown by their references to everyone contributing and their comments when the actual contribution pattern diverges from the earlier cooperative understanding. They notice inconsistency between stated group intentions and realized actions and express this as a form of mild expectation-violation rather than as anger or moral outrage.\n\nDespite recognizing that some players’ strategies yield them higher payoffs through non-contribution, the focal player does not adjust their own contribution level in response. This indicates that observing others’ advantageous free-riding does not trigger punitive withdrawal of cooperation. They continue to fully contribute even when it is evident that this leaves them relatively worse off than persistent defectors. Their main reaction is verbal reinforcement of the “everyone contributes” ideal, not behavioral punishment or strategic defection.\n\nThey align themselves with other cooperative voices in the group and verbally agree with claims that universal cooperation is best for payoffs. When other players reiterate that everyone should contribute to obtain higher earnings, the focal player explicitly endorses this, signaling social alignment with cooperative subgroups. They do not single out or criticize specific high-earning defectors or low contributors by name, suggesting an avoidance of interpersonal conflict or blame despite unequal outcomes.\n\nIn summary, their response to others’ outcomes is to cognitively register exploitation and norm violation, express light disappointment and reaffirm cooperative norms, but maintain their own full-cooperation strategy without retaliatory adaptation."

This suggests either a norm-based strategy (“I do what I think is right regardless of others”) or a belief that consistent high contributions are the best way to support or stabilize group cooperation. Their willingness to keep contributing fully in the presence of non-contributors indicates relatively high social risk tolerance: they accept being exploited by free riders in order to sustain collective benefits.\n\nThey also show no sign of strategic adjustment or tit-for-tat behavior; their contributions are both high and rigid rather than reactive. Fairness concerns, if present, do not translate into reduced giving in response to others’ lower contributions.

They appear tolerant of inequity: they accept that non-contributors benefit from their generosity without visibly retaliating or withdrawing cooperation. Their threshold for maintaining full cooperation is high; even repeated exposure to free-riding does not shift them toward self-protection. This pattern is consistent with a strong internal fairness or prosocial norm that does not rely on others reciprocating in the short run. Risk-wise, they accept the risk that others may not contribute and still choose the cooperative option, indicating willingness to gamble on collective outcomes rather than secure the sure private gain when there is a strong social multiplier. Their choices also indicate low volatility and high predictability; they are a “type” player more than a responsive strategist.

Their behavior indicates a strong preference for collective efficiency over individual payoff, even when some group members do not contribute. They tolerate exploitation by low contributors and do not display reactive defection or strategic withholding. This suggests either a firm internal norm favoring maximum cooperation or a deliberate payoff-maximizing logic that prioritizes group-level returns given the high multiplier; which motive dominates is unknown. They do not appear to condition their actions on specific peers’ past behavior, despite clear variation among others, indicating a non-retaliatory, non-conditional strategy.

They maintain full contribution up to and including the final round, despite clear knowledge of the finite horizon and the absence of future interaction incentives. This indicates that their cooperative strategy is not driven by backward induction logic or threats of future punishment. Instead, they treat the final round similarly to earlier ones, suggesting either a rule-based cooperative heuristic (“always fully contribute”), a persistent preference for social efficiency regardless of horizon, or a commitment to a prosocial identity that does not relax when future repercussions vanish. There is no observable attempt to exploit the final round for private gain; rather, cooperation is sustained or even reinforced as others move toward higher group contributions."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a stable, unconditional full cooperator under the presented options. When faced with an all-or-nothing choice, they consistently choose the fully cooperative action rather than the fully selfish one. Their pattern does not react to the presence of clear free riding by multiple others; they maintain the same cooperative decision instead of reducing their own contribution in response. This indicates a strategy that is not conditionally tied to others’ short-run behavior, at least within the short horizon and coarse action space available.\n\nThey appear to accept the social-efficiency logic of high contribution: they repeatedly take the option that maximizes the group’s total surplus, even when it is not individually dominant given known free riders. This suggests a preference structure that gives weight to collective outcomes or to a cooperation norm, over purely myopic self-interest. There is no evidence of strategic experimentation or mixed behavior; they do not probe others’ reactions by varying their choices, which suggests either strong internal norms or a low inclination toward tactical adaptation in this setting.\n\nFairness considerations are present but indirect: they continue to cooperate despite systematic under-contribution by a subset of others, so if they value fairness, they do not enforce it by reciprocating defection. Instead, they tolerate inequality in individual payoffs in order to preserve group efficiency. Their risk tolerance appears moderate to high with respect to social risk: they repeatedly expose themselves to the possibility of being exploited by free riders, without any available tools to protect themselves beyond changing their own contribution. This is consistent with a “principled cooperator” or “norm-following altruist” profile rather than a cautious conditional cooperator.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nNo chat content from this player is available; their communication style, tone, and responsiveness are therefore unknown. It is not possible to infer whether they attempt coordination, persuasion, or norm-setting in messages, nor whether they confront or ignore free riders verbally. Based solely on behavior, one might hypothesize that if they did speak, they could lean toward cooperative norm promotion rather than punitive language, but this is speculative and therefore must be treated as unknown or low-confidence.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nDespite a finite and clearly visible horizon, this player does not display end-game decay in cooperation. Their cooperative behavior remains intact through the final decision, even after sustained exposure to free riding in earlier stages. When other players increase their cooperation near the end, this player stays aligned with full contribution rather than shifting toward last-round defection or “cashing out.”\n\nThis suggests that their strategy is not driven by backward induction or short-horizon exploitation; they either disregard or deprioritize the standard logic that predicts cooperation collapse near the end. Instead, they exhibit “end-game integrity”: they behave in the last stage as they do in earlier ones, in line with a stable internal rule or norm rather than dynamic strategic adjustment. Whether they would maintain this stance over much longer horizons or in environments with punishment/reward opportunities remains unknown, but within this game they consistently resist the typical end-game temptation to defect."

Instead, they adhere to the same cooperative rule they use earlier, indicating that their cooperation is not contingent on future interactions or long-run reputation within this game.

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a strongly cooperative high contributor with one brief deviation. They consistently choose the full endowment contribution in nearly all rounds, including late in the game, even after multiple episodes of others free-riding. Their pattern indicates a stable preference for group efficiency and adherence to the “everyone contributes max” norm, rather than opportunistic exploitation. The single low-contribution choice appears as an isolated deviation rather than the start of a new strategy; there is no follow-up shift toward persistent free-riding. They do not condition their own contributions tightly on others’ behavior: they continue to contribute fully in many instances where at least one peer is clearly free-riding. This suggests either a strong internal norm of cooperation, low sensitivity to short-term unfairness, or a focus on maintaining group coordination rather than maximizing narrow individual payoff. Fairness matters to them in the sense that they are willing to pay to punish low contributors, but they do not let perceived unfairness systematically reduce their own contribution level. Risk tolerance appears moderate: they repeatedly “trust” the group by contributing fully after cooperation is restored, and do not preemptively defect as a hedge against possible future free-riding.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nTheir communication is minimal, affiliative, and compliant with group norms. They speak very little compared with others and do not initiate strategy discussions or attempt to lead coordination. When another player proposes a cooperative norm tied to punishment, they give a brief, positive acknowledgment, signaling agreement and alignment with that cooperative-punitive coalition rather than challenging or refining it. They do not push back against free-riders verbally; their social enforcement is via the punishment mechanism, not through chat. They also do not join in mild ridicule or moralizing comments made by others, nor do they defend low contributors; instead, they stay largely silent. Overall, they engage selectively, signaling assent and group belonging, but avoid taking a central or directive role. Their tone is neutral to friendly; there is no evidence of hostility, sarcasm, or open conflict.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThey show little evidence of a classic end-game unraveling. Their contributions remain high through the final phases, including the last round, even when at least one other player is still free-riding. There is a single late-game deviation to zero contribution, but they immediately return to full contributions in subsequent rounds rather than escalating defection as the horizon approaches. This suggests they do not rely on backward induction or a “last-round grab” as a guiding principle. Instead, they appear to maintain a cooperative rule-of-thumb throughout the game, treating the final rounds similarly to the middle rounds in terms of contribution behavior. Their willingness to keep contributing fully near the end implies either that they value norm consistency over marginal end-game gains, or that they mentally simplify the problem and do not significantly adjust strategy based on remaining rounds. Their punishment behavior near the end also continues in a similar pattern, indicating no clear ramp-up of vindictive or exploitative behavior as the game closes.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey are a selective but recurring punisher of low contributors. They do not punish in every instance of free-riding, but they use the mechanism multiple times across the game, reliably in contexts where at least one identifiable peer contributes less than the cooperative norm. There is no evidence that they punish high contributors or use punishment arbitrarily, which suggests a focus on norm enforcement rather than random aggression. The size of their punishment is modest and stable; they do not escalate dramatically even when low contributions recur. This pattern is consistent with a player who uses punishment as a costly signal and deterrent rather than as emotional retaliation. They also refrain from punishing when everyone contributes fully, supporting the interpretation that they tie punishment specifically to contribution deviations. The overall pattern fits a conditional cooperator with a willingness to incur moderate costs to sustain group cooperation and discipline free-riders. Their repeated return to punishment after periods of renewed free-riding suggests persistence in this role rather than giving up on enforcement.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nThey are never punished in the transcript, so their direct response to being targeted is unknown. Consequently, their attitudes toward identifiable punishers, in terms of forgiveness, retaliation, or compliance when personally punished, cannot be inferred. However, from the fact that they themselves engage in norm-enforcing punishment aligned with the group’s stated cooperative standard, it is plausible—but not confirmable—that they would view justified, contribution-based punishment as legitimate. Whether they would retaliate against perceived unfair punishment or reduce contributions in response is unknown, and confidence about their reactions to personal sanctions is low."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a highly stable high contributor. They give the maximum in essentially all rounds, with a single deliberate low-contribution “test” when the whole group temporarily deviates from full cooperation. They appear to adopt a norm of “everyone should give max” and largely stick to it regardless of others’ occasional shortfalls. The brief low contribution happens exactly when many others drop their contributions and collective norms wobble; after that, the player immediately returns to maximum giving and stays there. They do not visibly condition their contribution on individual others’ behavior; instead, they behave as if contributing fully is the right thing to do for the group, even when some individuals (e.g., the anomalous bird) undercontribute or free-ride. This suggests a principled cooperator or “moral cooperator” type whose own giving is not easily undermined by noise or unfairness. Risk tolerance appears moderate: they are willing to risk being exploited by a persistent low contributor rather than spiral into mutual defection. There is no evidence of opportunistic self-maximization via undercontribution.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThe player is relatively quiet but not completely silent. When they do speak, it is informational and cooperative rather than emotional or aggressive. They volunteer useful experimental knowledge about the payment conversion, clarifying payoff structure for others. This shows attention to instructions and a desire to ground group expectations. They do not join in the more heated or mocking chat about punishing the “angry bird” or other players, nor do they try to steer norms via strong moral language. They refrain from theatrics, jokes, or social bonding chatter, and do not signal alliances or participate in the “mob” dynamics. Their tone is calm, factual, and helpful; they participate selectively when they have something concrete to add, then withdraw. They also do not publicly discuss their own coin totals or emotional state about fairness, indicating a reserved, low-drama communication style focused on task-relevant information.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThis player almost never punishes. Across many opportunities, they repeatedly choose to spend nothing on punishment, even when there are clear undercontributors or widely condemned targets. The single instance where they do punish is directed at the persistent low-contributing, reward-gaming “bird” avatar, and it aligns with a strong, widely shared social norm in the group at that time. They spend the minimum nonzero amount, consistent with “doing their part” in a collective sanction rather than trying to lead or escalate punishment. They never punish ordinary low-contributors in early coordination phases and never retaliate against anyone who affects their own payoff directly. There is no evidence of spite or revenge; their one punishment move is consistent with norm enforcement against extreme deviation plus strategic concern that the bird is distorting outcomes. Overall, they fit a “reluctant punisher” type: willing to punish once when the group strongly converges on a target and the deviation is glaring, but with a strong default of avoiding punitive spending to preserve their own payoff.\n\n<REWARD>\nThe player never uses rewards, despite frequent opportunities and visible examples of others rewarding. They do not even use small symbolic rewards toward high contributors or “justice enforcers.” This suggests that, given the unfavorable reward technology (costly to give, low impact), they regard rewarding as inefficient or unnecessary. They appear to believe that maintaining high contributions themselves and possibly supporting occasional group punishment is sufficient to sustain cooperation, without needing to pay extra to thank or incentivize others. There is no sign of using rewards to curry favor, form alliances, or compensate punished players. Their stance is consistent with a payoff-conscious cooperator who sees punishment (rarely) as more cost-effective than reward, and who otherwise prefers to keep coins rather than redistribute them voluntarily.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThis player pays attention to the payoff structure and conversion into real money, and they share this information once, helping others calibrate expectations. They notice and comment on the coin-to-cash rate, indicating that they track their earnings in real terms, yet they do not dramatically change behavior in response; they still keep contributing max and mostly avoid costly sanctions. They do not publicly react to specific individuals’ gains or losses, despite dramatic swings caused by the punishment campaign against the bird. They abstain from praising “police” players or condemning free-riders in chat, and they do not seem emotionally reactive to seeing others overspend on justice or be heavily penalized. Their single punitive action aligns with broad consensus against a particularly abnormal outcome pattern (the bird accumulating large payoffs while undercontributing and manipulating rewards), showing that they update on extreme inequities but remain disciplined and selective. Overall, they process others’ outcomes cognitively—understanding conversion rates and strategic implications—yet keep their own behavior stable, cooperative, and low-intervention, intervening with punishment only once when a clear, group-endorsed target emerges."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a generally pro-cooperative conditional cooperator with some opportunistic deviation. Their default preference is to contribute the full endowment when group norms and coordination are salient, and they explicitly advocate that everyone contribute the maximum to maximize collective returns. They start by fully cooperating and later return to full cooperation after a brief period of partial giving. In the middle of the game they reduce their contribution to an intermediate level while still promoting high contributions from others, indicating some willingness to free-ride modestly when others’ behavior is noisy or disappointing. They do not test extreme defection; instead, their low point is partial contribution rather than zero, suggesting internalized fairness or guilt aversion: they still want to “put something in” while not bearing the full cooperative cost. Their pattern shows conditionality: when some members persistently under-contribute or seem unresponsive, they relax their own standard somewhat, but once high-contribution norms are reasserted (and backed by punishment), they revert to full contributions and maintain them through the end. Risk-wise, they are willing to invest fully in the public fund if they believe coordination is likely, and do not seem overly cautious; they accept the risk that others may not match their contributions, relying on punishment and social pressure to sustain cooperation.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThey are an active, norm-promoting communicator with a friendly, informal tone. They use short, encouraging messages and positive affect (e.g., friendly affirmations and emoticons) to signal commitment and reassure others that they are cooperating. They clearly try to coordinate around the “everyone gives maximum” norm and repeat this message across rounds. They support others’ pro-cooperation statements, echoing calls for full contributions rather than initiating complex strategic discussions. They also join in labeling specific low contributors as owing more to the group and implicitly endorsing sanctions or higher expectations for them. Their communication style is affiliative and team-oriented rather than confrontational; they do not insult defectors but treat non-contributors as people who “owe” the group or are perhaps inactive. They respond to group suggestions about sanction schemes and explicitly signal agreement, helping to build common knowledge of a tough-on-defectors norm. Late in the game, they show some reflective uncertainty about whether some low contributors are even paying attention or active, which hints at a charitable or at least exploratory attribution style rather than pure moral condemnation.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThey show clear awareness of the finite horizon and treat late rounds as an opportunity to harden cooperation via threatened punishment rather than to personally defect. When others propose harsh end-game deductions for under-contributors, they explicitly endorse this plan but do not themselves respond by reducing their own contributions; instead, they maintain full cooperation. There is no evidence of end-game decay in their contributions; if anything, they become more rigidly cooperative and enforcement-oriented near the end once a sanctioning scheme is articulated. This suggests they prioritize norm consistency and group payoff even when there is no future round in which reputational or reciprocity benefits can be realized. They use the known end of the game to coordinate a final, strict standard (“everyone must contribute fully or be punished”) rather than to exploit others’ trust. Their strategy in the final phase is thus: full contribution, support for punitive deterrence, and some cognitive updating about others’ possible inactivity.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey are willing to incur nontrivial personal costs to punish, but not immediately and not maximally; their style is targeted enforcement, not indiscriminate aggression. Early on, they refrain from punishment even when clear low contributors exist, possibly relying on others to enforce or hoping social norms and talk will suffice. As low contributions repeat and seem intentional, they start to punish, spending enough to be meaningful but staying far below the most extreme punishers in the group. Their targets are consistently those who contribute little or nothing relative to the emerging group norm, especially repeatedly low contributors; there is no evidence they punish high contributors or apparent cooperators, which makes their punishment pattern look norm-enforcing rather than spiteful. They also join in verbal support of coordinated group punishment of persistent low contributors, indicating they see punishment mainly as a deterrent and a tool to secure cooperation, not as a vehicle for personal revenge. At the same time, their own moderate contribution reductions in the mid-game, combined with their willingness to punish others, suggests a mild asymmetry: they accept punishing defectors while themselves occasionally under-contributing relative to the explicit “everyone max” norm. This is consistent with a “moralistic but somewhat self-serving enforcer” type rather than a perfectly strict altruistic punisher.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey pay attention to both others’ contributions and the intensity of punishment others receive, and these observations clearly shape their beliefs and behavior. They publicly call out that certain players “owe” more to the pot and support the notion that non-contributors should face serious deductions. They notice and comment when specific low-contributing players revert back to zero contributions after temporarily increasing, interpreting that as problematic behavior. Yet when extreme, coordinated punishment leads to huge negative or near-zero payoffs for chronic low contributors, they do not express sympathy or objection; instead they remain focused on norm enforcement and the possibility that some players may be bots or inactive. Their later remark that some might not be active suggests they update their mental model of certain players from “bad” to “possibly absent,” which slightly softens the moral framing but does not visibly change their enforcement stance. They also attend to others’ punishment spending patterns implicitly, aligning themselves verbally with those advocating strong sanctions, but they themselves do not escalate to the highest punishment levels observed. Overall, they interpret outcome information through a group-norm lens: high payoffs paired with high contribution are expected and desirable; high payoffs for low contributors are seen as unjust and trigger support for sanctions; extremely low payoffs for punished defectors are accepted as the cost of enforcing cooperation."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a generally high contributor who aims for full cooperation but is not unconditionally altruistic. They endorse the norm that everyone should give the maximum and explicitly promote this as the group’s standard. Their own behavior is mostly consistent with high cooperation, but they do strategically under-contribute in some middle rounds while still publicly pressing others to increase. This indicates conditional cooperation with a self-interested streak rather than pure unconditional giving. They appear to view “maximum contribution by all” as both fair and payoff-maximizing and expect others to adhere to that. They tolerate some noise or partial improvement from others (e.g., noticing when low contributors move up but still criticizing them for not reaching the maximum), but they clearly treat zero or persistently low contributions as norm violations. Risk-wise, they are willing to “trust” the group with full contributions multiple times even after free-riding appears, but they adjust in the middle of the game, suggesting moderate risk tolerance conditioned on observed behavior.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThey are active and engaged in chat, aligning quickly with early full-cooperation proposals and reinforcing group-oriented language (“team,” “everyone,” “we”). Their tone is generally cooperative but becomes critical toward specific low contributors. They call out low contributors by name and publicly pressure them to increase to the maximum, including bringing attention to others’ mid-level contributions and framing that as inadequate. They also explicitly restate the payoff logic (that giving the maximum leads to maximal returns for everyone), attempting to persuade others using both fairness and efficiency arguments. They coordinate around punishment norms as well, agreeing to strategies suggested by others and reporting their own compliance. They respond to others’ comments and build on them rather than talking past the group, showing responsiveness and a preference for explicit norm-setting and coordination. There is mild exasperation toward suspected “fake” or non-responsive players, but they maintain a relatively matter-of-fact tone rather than becoming abusive.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThey are clearly aware of the game horizon and adapt their stance as the end approaches. When another player proposes that contributions below the maximum in the final phase should be punished heavily, they promptly and explicitly endorse this. They continue to contribute the maximum themselves in the late game and signal that they are following through on the agreed punitive strategy. There is no visible decay in their own cooperation at the end; instead, they support escalating punishment threats as a way to lock in full contributions in the final rounds. This pattern suggests they treat the end-game not as an opportunity to defect but as a moment to enforce norms more strictly and secure collective payoff, even if that requires costly sanctioning.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey are clearly willing to punish and spend multiple units on punishment in several rounds. Their punishment appears norm-enforcing rather than retaliatory: there is no evidence they are themselves targeted and then respond; instead, they punish others who contribute little or nothing relative to the agreed-upon maximum. They explicitly link punishment to contribution behavior, agreeing that people who give less than the maximum should face deductions and affirming their own participation in that scheme. Their punishment is selective—aimed at clear under-contributors, particularly those who persist in contributing nothing or well below the group’s target after repeated discussion. They also support the idea of collective, coordinated punishment (“everyone deduct from them”), indicating a deterrence motive: they want punishment to signal that deviation from the norm will reliably be met with losses. There is no evidence they use punishment out of spite unrelated to contribution behavior; all observed comments about sanctioning connect it to cooperation levels.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey pay close attention to others’ outcomes and behavior. They notice when some players contribute nothing, and when others increase from zero to partial contributions, commenting that those changes are still insufficient compared to the agreed maximum. They acknowledge the presence of extreme punishment on low contributors and are part of the social conversation about those large deductions, though they do not explicitly moralize about punishment intensity beyond endorsing the basic principle. They infer that some persistently low or erratic players might be non-serious or non-human participants and adjust their expectations accordingly, but they still advocate continued pressure and punishment toward them. When discussing who “owes” the group or who “needs to up” their contribution, they are clearly tracking both past and present behavior, not just the most recent round, and they use that information to support calls for future punishment or continued demands for full contribution. Overall, they appear outcome-sensitive and norm-oriented, using others’ payoffs and contributions as cues for who deserves social pressure and sanction."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a strict, unconditional full cooperator within the horizon provided. They always contribute the entire endowment and never experiment with lower amounts, despite clear evidence that several others repeatedly free-ride. Their cooperation is therefore not conditional on observed group behavior in this game; they continue to maximize the group’s material efficiency even when others do not. This suggests a strong internal norm that “the right thing” is to give the maximum, combined with relatively low concern for own short-run payoff optimization. They exhibit a fairness norm defined as “everyone should contribute the maximum,” but they do not adjust their own contribution downward when that fairness norm is violated. Risk tolerance regarding exploitation is high: they accept being systematically more generous than many others. There is no observable volatility in contribution; their strategy is stable and rigid rather than adaptive in contribution levels.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThey communicate as an assertive, coordination-focused team player. From the outset, they propose the simple focal rule that everyone contributes the maximum and frame it as a team effort that benefits all. They repeat this norm multiple times, even after it is clear that several players are not following it, indicating persistence and a desire to keep the group anchored on the cooperative strategy. Their tone is direct but not hostile; they use inclusive language (“everyone,” “team”) and avoid insults, although they do label some low contributors as “trolling” and question whether they are real/active, reflecting frustration and a tendency to explain defection as non-serious or non-human behavior. They respond actively to others’ chat, acknowledge others’ observations, and build on emerging group norms (for example, explicitly aligning with the idea that the group should punish undercontributors in later rounds). They attempt to lead by articulating clear rules (contribute maximum; punish non-compliers at the end), and they try to make consequences explicit to shape others’ expectations (“anyone less than max will lose their pot”). Overall, they are engaged, directive, and norm-enforcing rather than withdrawn or purely self-focused.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThey are clearly horizon-aware and bring the end of the game into their normative enforcement strategy. While their own contributions remain maximally cooperative through the final round (no decay in cooperation), they explicitly propose tying harsh punishment to the last round: anyone who does not contribute the maximum in the final stage should be collectively punished. This indicates they think strategically about how the finite horizon might invite last-round defection and aim to preempt it with a credible threat of strong sanctions. They do not themselves increase punishment spending in the last round and, in fact, use less punishment than in a prior round, suggesting that their main adjustment to the end-game is rhetorical and coordinative (threats and norm statements) rather than a change in their own costly actions. Their cooperation thus does not unravel as the game ends; instead, they try to sustain or even strengthen cooperation norms with end-game-focused punishment planning.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey are willing but selective punishers, with a clear trigger: contributing far below the agreed maximum, especially after repeated discussion and clarification. For several rounds they choose not to spend on punishment at all, even when free-riding is present. This suggests either an initial hope that communication alone will align behavior or a reluctance to incur punishment costs until noncompliance becomes persistent and salient. When they finally deploy punishment, they spend a nontrivial amount in a single round, consistent with a norm-enforcement motive rather than mild signaling. The targets, inferred from their chat, are extreme or repeated undercontributors, not minor deviators, which indicates they distinguish between small shortfalls and blatant free-riding. Their language about punishment (“everyone should deduct from them,” “they will lose their pot”) frames sanctions as a collective deterrent tool, not as personal retaliation for being personally harmed. They coordinate with others around punishment rules and timing, pointing to a preference for shared, predictable enforcement rather than idiosyncratic or emotional punishment. After this heavy sanctioning incident, they personally refrain from further costly punishment, which could indicate satisfaction that the message has been sent, a desire to avoid overspending, or a belief that group-level punishment is already sufficient. There is no clear evidence of spiteful or retaliatory targeting beyond norm violations; motives appear primarily deterrent and pro-social in intent.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey pay close attention to others’ contributions and, at least to some extent, to punishment outcomes. They repeatedly call out specific low contributors by role name and track when someone increases or decreases their contribution relative to the expected maximum. Their comments focus mainly on behavior (who is giving zero or less than the maximum, who has “gone back” to lower contributions) rather than on others’ exact payoffs, but they do notice large punishment totals and express surprise at extreme deductions. When they see heavy sanctions being applied, they remark on how large the deductions are, signaling awareness of how severe group punishment can be when many players coordinate. They interpret persistent undercontributors as possibly inactive or non-serious and discuss them with others in that frame, suggesting they are mentally categorizing types of players (cooperators, norm violators, maybe bots/inactive players). Their emotional tone around others’ outcomes is mostly matter-of-fact and strategic: they note who should be punished and encourage group response, rather than expressing personal resentment or gloating over specific losses. Overall, they monitor the social and payoff environment to reinforce their cooperation-and-punishment norm, but they do not use detailed payoff accounting to fine-tune their own contributions or punishments."

They quickly commit in chat to “100%” contributions going forward, and then actually contributes the maximum endowment essentially every round, including when others defect or when they themselves suffer large payoff losses from punishment spending. The only non-max contribution appears early and is immediately framed as a mistake, followed by explicit promises to contribute fully. Their cooperation is not obviously conditional on others’ behavior: they keep putting in the full amount even when group contributions drop sharply or when specific individuals free-ride. They seem to treat full contribution as a moral or normative baseline (“follow society rules”) rather than a strategic lever, and they show no sign of lowering contributions to retaliate or to protect their own earnings. Risk tolerance in contributions is high; they are willing to lose money relative to more selfish strategies and do not adjust that stance when they learn the actual money conversion rate. They appear fairness-driven at the level of norms (everyone should give the max), but they enforce norms primarily via punishment rather than adjusting their own giving.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThey are highly chatty, humorous, and socially central. They frequently initiate topics, coin jokes, and use playful metaphors (e.g., “police,” “justice,” references to movies and bots, joking about inspect-element “cheats”). They engage in coalition-building, repeatedly trying to coordinate group norms and group punishment, including explicit calls for everyone to “hit” a target together. They are responsive to others’ comments, acknowledge others’ points, and riff on shared themes (e.g., whether the bird is a bot, pay fairness, the length of the game). Their tone mixes light sarcasm and self-deprecation with serious norm-enforcement messages. They openly reveal their own coin total when others discuss payoffs, which suggests comfort with transparency and with turning private information into a public coordination signal. They also probe and tease quieter players (e.g., questioning silence as “sus”), trying to draw them into the social fabric. Overall, they are an active “narrator-instigator” type: they keep the chat lively while steering it toward common targets and shared understandings about the game and its norms.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey are an extremely willing and often heavy punisher, to the point of repeatedly sacrificing large portions of their own payoff. Early, they immediately punish the prominent low contributor and later escalate to multi-unit, high-cost punishments against the same “angry bird” (Parrot), even when others caution that it may be a bot and that punishing wastes coins. Their language frames punishment as “justice,” “police duty,” and “making an example,” indicating a strong moralistic and norm-enforcing motivation rather than pure payoff maximization. They openly acknowledge that this is financially irrational (“taking straight loss,” “emptying my bank on justice,” “perma police”) yet keep doing it, suggesting intrinsic satisfaction from norm reinforcement and from coordinated collective punishment. They actively recruit others to punish, encouraging multi-player “dogpiles” to bankrupt or discipline targets and treating that as a joint project. Their punishments are mostly directed at:\n- Chronic under-contributors / norm violators (Parrot, low contributors, sudden defection).\n- Occasional “suspicious” cooperators (e.g., Monkey, Rabbit once) when they appear to be linked to the bird’s unusual reward pattern or odd behavior; here they signal “warning shots” rather than immediate maximal sanctions.\nThey rarely, if ever, punish high cooperators for ordinary variation; the targeting seems anchored in perceived rule-breaking, free-riding, or “suspicious” patterns. They also sometimes threaten to “max” punish if personally targeted, implying a readiness for strong retaliation if attacked. Overall, punishment is primarily deterrent and expressive of group norms, with some paranoia-driven components when trying to infer hidden relationships.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey exhibit very low baseline willingness to use the reward mechanism, especially compared to punishment. For most of the game they do not reward anyone despite clearly valuing high cooperators and despite receiving rewards themselves. Near the end, they do use reward once in a non-trivial way, spending enough to give a meaningful bonus to a peer who has been aligned and cooperative (Moose). This delayed, targeted reward appears more like a gesture of appreciation or alliance-strengthening than a systematic strategy: they choose a socially connected, cooperative peer who has been active in coordination and anti-bird efforts. They also verbally request to be “topped up” by others when they burn many coins on punishment, signaling that they conceptually separate “justice spending” from reward reciprocity. In practice, they treat reward as secondary and symbolic—used sparingly, to acknowledge or reciprocate support, rather than as a main tool for shaping behavior.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey pay close attention to who earned what, who was punished, and who was rewarded, and they frequently comment on these outcomes in chat. Large gains by the problematic bird strongly trigger them; they interpret high payoffs combined with low contributions or odd reward patterns as evidence of free-riding, trolling, or bot-like behavior, and respond by organizing collective punishment. They track who is getting rewards from the bird and use that as a basis for social suspicion (e.g., interrogating Monkey and Cow about being “in on it”), though they will back off somewhat once those players openly explain themselves. They are sensitive to group-level fairness: they repeatedly highlight when a deviant makes “the most” while not following rules, and they express satisfaction when coordinated punishment drags that player back down. They also show empathetic but joking reactions when innocent cooperators get hit (e.g., Frog, Cow), encouraging them to “clap back” or get revenge, and framing that as justified reciprocity. When others caution that punishing the bird is wasteful given the bonus conversion, they acknowledge the logic but still often choose to punish, articulating that it “costs a penny to feel better,” indicating they weight fairness and expressive satisfaction over strict monetary efficiency. They adapt somewhat to information (learning the conversion rate, realizing the bird may be part of the design, noticing the time cost of the study), but their core behavioral type—max cooperator, norm-focused, punishment-ready—remains stable."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a stable, unconditional full cooperator. They always contribute the entire endowment in every observed round, including when others reduce their contributions sharply, when punishment becomes chaotic, and when they themselves are punished once. Their own behavior does not appear to condition on group contribution levels, on being treated unfairly, or on the length/return of the game. They implicitly adopt a strong “do the socially right thing regardless” norm, even when the marginal return is low and when others discuss that the monetary payoff may not justify effort. Risk tolerance for exploitation is high: they keep contributing fully amid clear, repeated evidence that some others are deviating or free-riding. There is no sign of end-game defection or strategic withholding; they maintain the same pattern until the final round shown.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThey communicate sparsely but clearly, with a straightforward and cooperative tone. Early on they agree with the group’s call for maximum contributions and later make a rare, norm-affirming statement emphasizing that people “have to give” when someone else complains about being hit by the punishing bird. They occasionally inject light criticism (e.g., expressing disapproval of a low contributor) but without hostility. They also show some procedural awareness and mild skepticism about the experiment’s design and compensation, remarking on how pre-submitting completion on the recruitment platform affects minimum pay. They raise a technical/process issue about chat messages disappearing and explicitly ask whether others notice it, showing attention to interface and fairness of the information environment. Overall, they are engaged enough to track dynamics and meta-issues, but they do not try to lead, rally factions, or steer group norms through speech; they mostly comment and observe rather than orchestrate.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey are generally reluctant to use punishment, but not absolutist. Their punishment is rare, targeted, and clearly norm-driven rather than emotional or spiteful. They punish only twice: once early, directed at a very low contributor relative to the emerging “max or near-max” norm; and much later, directed at two specific players who contribute sharply below the group’s level after long periods of mutual cooperation. This pattern suggests they view punishment as a tool for enforcing a high-contribution norm when deviations are salient and potentially destabilizing. They do not join in the large, repeated anti-bird punishment cascades, nor in later mobbing of suspected “researcher/bot” or “sus” players, even when others explicitly coordinate mass punishments. They also never retaliate against those who punish them; when they receive an unjustified deduction, they neither punish back nor reduce their contributions. In summary, they are a selective, norm-enforcing punisher with a high threshold: willing to spend on punishment when a deviation is clear and personally judged as unfair, but unwilling to participate in symbolic, costly “justice” campaigns or to punish for entertainment or revenge.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey never use rewards at any point, despite frequent group discussions about topping up “police” players and about various players receiving rewards from the bird. There is no evidence that they even experiment with rewarding once. Given that they observe the same information as others, this suggests either (a) they do not see rewarding as necessary or efficient relative to simply sustaining their own high contribution, or (b) they implicitly prioritize preserving coins for their own payoff over positive reinforcement, even while tolerating some punishment costs in very specific cases. Compared to their selective willingness to punish, their total absence of rewarding indicates an asymmetry: they are prepared to sanction norm-breakers but not to pay to recognize or encourage norm-compliers, at least under this cost/benefit structure.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey monitor others’ payoffs and the mechanism outcomes enough to notice anomalies and comment on them. They remark when a known low contributor is still doing well, express disapproval of that behavior, and later call out under-contributors as “sus” or problematic. They also notice the bird/parrot’s unusual payoff growth and question how it is gaining so much, indicating attention to aggregate outcomes and possible manipulation. When the group’s punishment campaigns against the bird become intense and prolonged, they consistently refrain from joining, even while acknowledging the situation in chat, implying that their internal tradeoff between fairness and personal payoff is more conservative than that of the self-styled “justice” players. Their own behavior remains stable and cooperative regardless of whether others are being heavily punished, massively rewarded, or partly exploited. In short, they are observant and analytically engaged with others’ outcomes, but they do not let those observations destabilize their core strategy of full contribution plus highly selective punishment."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a strict, stable full cooperator. They always contribute the maximum possible amount to the public good, from the very start and without experimenting or hedging. Their cooperation is not conditional on others’ behavior: they keep contributing fully even when others under-contribute, when there is confusion, when there is clear evidence of a disruptive “bot-like” player, and when they themselves are actively spending on punishment or reward. They consistently endorse the “max for everyone” social norm in chat and never advocate lowering contributions. Risk tolerance appears relatively high: they do not appear to protect themselves by reducing contributions in response to uncertainty, free-riding, or ending-game fatigue. There is no sign of opportunistic behavior; they behave like a principled cooperator with a fairness norm that “everyone should give the max” and that they themselves should do so regardless.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThey are moderately chatty and clearly engaged with the group, but not the dominant voice. Tone is warm, humorous, and prosocial. They align themselves with the cooperative majority, support emerging norms, and occasionally inject light jokes about the game’s length and “living here now,” which shows comfort and social ease rather than detachment or hostility.\n\nThey respond to others’ points (e.g., acknowledging correction about player count, agreeing that some behavior “makes sense,” echoing “sus” judgments about potentially problematic avatars) rather than driving their own agenda. They rarely initiate new strategic norms, but they reinforce existing ones and lend social support to those enforcing cooperation.\n\nThey participate in the shared narrative about the “angry bird/parrot” and researchers, appear to enjoy the collective theorizing, and use that narrative as a frame for behavior (“kill the bird,” “very sus”). They are not confrontational; even when advocating retaliation against the disruptive avatar, their style remains playful and collective (“have a little boost; kill the bird”) rather than aggressive or moralizing.\n\nOverall, they show a cooperative, affiliative, and group-oriented communication style: they help maintain cohesion, validate others, and keep the mood light, while staying aligned with cooperative norms.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey are willing to punish, but only selectively and under strong social consensus. For most of the game they refrain from using punishment at all despite repeated calls from others to “ding” under-contributors and the disruptive bird. This indicates an underlying reluctance to spend on punishment or a preference to let others take that role when it is already being filled.\n\nThey eventually do punish, and their target choice is tightly norm-based: they punish the clearly non-compliant “angry bird/parrot,” and much later again target the same avatar in a mixed punishment/reward move. They do not punish borderline contributors, slight deviations, or human cooperators who make small mistakes. There is no evidence of spite, personal vendetta, or punishment directed at group members who question the experiment or pay rates.\n\nTheir punishment seems motivated by collective justice and norm enforcement rather than personal gain: they punish when the bird is viewed as an unfair, possibly non-human exploiter, and they frame it in chat as something that “has to change” and that “they’ll feel.” They join the coordinated “hit the bird” moments but do not escalate beyond what others are doing, and they do not continue punishing once the bird is heavily sanctioned and group attention drifts.\n\nDeterrence and moral signaling appear more important than maximizing their own payoff. However, they do not turn into a “perma police”; they remain a mostly cooperative, low-punishment type who intervenes episodically when the group norm and their own sense of fairness are strongly violated.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey are distinctly more inclined to use reward than punishment, especially early on. They reward only a few times, which makes those choices informative. Recipients of their rewards are consistently high contributors and/or victims/allies in the bird drama: players who cooperate fully and either suffer from unjust deductions or invest heavily in group justice. They use reward to top up allies and to reinforce prosocial behavior.\n\nTheir reward behavior looks intentional rather than random: they spread small, costly rewards to specific cooperators, suggesting they pay attention to who has behaved “well” or been treated unfairly, and they are willing to sacrifice their own earnings to support those players. They also reward the talkative enforcer once, signaling gratitude and alliance.\n\nThey never reward low contributors or the bird. They are not using reward to manipulate future play (no evidence of “reward to make defectors cooperate”); instead, they behave like a conditional altruist who uses reward to recognize and bolster existing cooperators and justice enforcers. They are also comfortable combining reward and punishment in a single round, showing they think in terms of a full toolkit of social incentives rather than a single preferred mechanism.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey pay close attention to others’ outcomes and integrate this into their social and strategic views. They notice when someone has exited, when someone is doing unusually well, and when payoffs jump due to reward or punishment activity. They explicitly comment on anomalies (e.g., someone earning “+42” or “doing so well”) and on fairness (“that’s got to change” when the bird’s payoff is disproportionate).\n\nWhen others are heavily punished (e.g., frog, cow), they sympathize and respond constructively rather than ignoring it. They compliment or help those players via reward or by encouraging them to retaliate and giving them “a little boost.” This shows sensitivity to others’ disadvantage and a willingness to redistribute from themselves to restore perceived fairness.\n\nThey accept being rewarded without gloating; when thanked by another player, they respond briefly but positively, indicating they interpret reward as a social bond rather than a license to free-ride. They do not appear envious of other cooperators doing marginally better; they share their own cumulative coins transparently and engage lightly in that comparison without changing behavior.\n\nThey also update beliefs based on observed outcomes: they join the group’s emerging belief that the bird is likely a bot or researcher, react to how many coins the bird accumulates, and adjust from passivity to active punishment once the extent of the bird’s advantage is salient and the group shifts to “destroy the bird” coordination. However, these belief updates do not make them reduce their public contributions; they remain steadfastly cooperative even when perceiving the game as somewhat unfair or exploitative.\n\nIn sum, this player is a “Principled Group Altruist with Selective Justice”: they always cooperate fully, are socially engaged and supportive, reward good partners and victims, and reserve punishment for clear, consensus-defined violators such as a suspected bot/free-rider. They prioritize fairness and group cohesion over narrow self-interest, and they adapt their use of punishment and reward in response to others’ outcomes while keeping their own contribution level constant."

        "weight": 1.0,
        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a high, mostly unconditional cooperator with occasional small defections that seem driven by doubt or fatigue rather than a systematic exploitative strategy.\n\nThey contribute the full endowment in the vast majority of rounds, including at the very start when the group norm of full contribution is still only being proposed, which indicates a willingness to “go first” on cooperation and accept personal risk. When they undercontribute, they do so only mildly (low single digits) and very rarely, and they do not follow through with a sustained reduction even after being punished once for contributing very little. This pattern suggests they value maintaining the cooperative norm and the resulting group earnings more than they value short‑term individual gains from free‑riding.\n\nTheir initial explanation that they “weren’t sure if people were bluffing” shows conditionality based on expectations of others’ behavior: they are willing to be fully cooperative, but they care whether the group is truly aligned. Once they see stable high contributions from others, they settle into reliably maxing out, without trying to track or fine‑tune their own contribution against others’ small deviations.\n\nThey show no evidence of fine‑grained payoff optimization (they do not start shaving their contribution by 1–2 units once cooperation is stable), which, combined with their tolerance of minor norm violations by others, points to a “prosocial but not hyper‑calculating” type. They also continue full cooperation even as the chat becomes increasingly focused on low pay and fatigue, suggesting they either discount the opportunity cost of time or prioritize finishing cleanly with the group.\n\nOverall, this is best described as a “loyal cooperator”: they enter willing to cooperate, briefly test the sincerity of others, and then stay aligned with the cooperative norm almost regardless of noise, trolling, or frustration.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThey communicate sparingly but meaningfully, with a cooperative, apologetic, and information‑seeking tone. Compared to very chatty players, they rarely initiate topics; when they do speak, it is directly related to coordination or understanding anomalies.\n\nEarly on, they openly admit past undercontribution and apologize, framing it explicitly as uncertainty rather than selfishness. This disclosure indicates concern for their reputation and a desire to repair trust. They quickly endorse the “all max, no deductions” coordination proposal once it is reiterated, showing alignment with group norms and willingness to publicly commit.\n\nLater, when the group suspects a “bot” or manipulated account, they ask a targeted question about whether anyone has rewarded that player, indicating they track payoff anomalies and seek clarification rather than jumping immediately to conspiracy or moral outrage. This displays curiosity and analytic engagement rather than emotional escalation.\n\nThey do not join in the more theatrical, punitive rhetoric (“kill X,” “destroy the bird”) nor in meta‑complaints about pay or platform ethics. Relative to the dominant chat tone, they are calm, low‑key, and non‑provocative, aligning themselves with the cooperative majority without taking on a leadership or inciter role. They respond when directly implicated (explaining their earlier behavior) and when they perceive informational gaps (asking about rewards), but otherwise default to quiet cooperation.\n\nIn social style, they come across as conciliatory, reputation‑sensitive, and group‑oriented, but not attention‑seeking.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey never use the punishment mechanism despite many opportunities, including clear norm violations (very low contributions) and strong group pressure to “deal justice.” This consistent non‑use, across both early uncertainty and later coordinated punishment campaigns, suggests a stable aversion to costly punishment.\n\nGiven the punishment technology is very powerful relative to its cost, their abstention is unlikely to be due to misunderstanding the mechanism. Instead, it indicates either a preference to avoid harming others, skepticism about the value of punishment for group outcomes, or a personal cost‑benefit calculus that deems even cheap punishment not worth the reduction in their own payoff.\n\nThey also refrain from “joining the crowd” in punitive episodes where virtually everyone else is targeting a single deviant, which implies they are not particularly swayed by social pressure to punish. There is no sign of reactive retaliation: even after they themselves are punished for low contribution, they do not punish back and instead simply restore high contributions and apologize in chat. This is more consistent with a forgiving or non‑vengeful type than with a conditional cooperator who uses punishment as enforcement.\n\nFunctionally, they behave as a “principled non‑punisher”: they want cooperation, but they prefer to sustain it through their own consistent contribution and communication rather than by inflicting costs on others.\n\n<REWARD>\nFor most of the game, they do not use the reward mechanism at all, even when others are actively rewarded for high contributions or for punishing perceived deviants. This again points to a conservative approach to spending on social tools: they prioritize keeping their own earnings rather than using them to shape others’ incentives.\n\nHowever, there is one clear deviation: in a later round they do reward at least one other player (evident from others noting “bunny and cow rewarded”). The context is one in which some players have been randomly targeted or “wronged” by the suspected bot‐like player, and others discuss boosting them. Their lone use of rewards coincides with that narrative, suggesting that when they do reward, it is not for strict norm enforcement but for compensating perceived unfair harm or for solidarity with victims.\n\nEven in that case, they use reward very sparingly; they do not begin a pattern of regular rewarding afterward. This makes them a “reluctant rewarder”: default is to keep coins, with rare, low‑intensity deviations when motivated by fairness or empathy.\n\nThey do not appear to use reward instrumentally to sustain high contributions (they never systematically reward top contributors), nor to curry favor; the isolated reward use is more consistent with moral expression than with strategic incentive design.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey pay attention to others’ outcomes and use them to update beliefs and ask questions, but they do not let others’ payoffs drive their own aggression or opportunism.\n\nWhen they undercontribute early and see that the group did indeed largely match the proposed full‑contribution norm, they quickly issue an apology and then align their behavior with the majority, indicating that observing others’ high contributions and payoffs pushes them toward more, not less, cooperation.\n\nThey notice the anomalously high earnings and complex punishment/reward activity of the “angry bird/parrot” player and actively query the group about whether anyone has been rewarding that player. This shows that they are monitoring others’ round payoffs and punishment/reward summaries, and they use this information diagnostically to understand the environment. They accept the emerging group framing (that this player may be a bot or special role) but do not escalate it into personal vendetta through their own punishment.\n\nWhen they themselves are punished in a round where they contributed almost nothing, they do not protest in chat. Instead, their future contributions return to the maximum level and stay there, suggesting they interpret negative outcomes as a signal about expected norms rather than as an affront that requires retaliation. This is consistent with a player who internalizes feedback rather than trying to counter‑punish.\n\nThey also show no sign of free‑riding based on others’ enforcement efforts. Even when others expend large amounts on punishment, dragging their own payoffs down, this player continues to contribute highly and avoids exploiting the protection arising from others’ policing.\n\nOverall, they are attentive and reflective about others’ payoffs and sanctioning but respond mainly by adjusting their own cooperation and seeking information, not by changing their willingness to harm, reward, or exploit others."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a persistent unconditional high contributor. They always contribute the full endowment, even when others deviate sharply or when they explicitly acknowledge that pay is low relative to time. Their own stated stance is that they will contribute the maximum regardless of others, and their behavior matches that. They do not condition contributions on low effort, exploitation by the “angry bird”, or uncertainty about remaining rounds. Risk tolerance is high: they keep sacrificing private payoff to maintain group efficiency even when the marginal per capita return is low and others intermittently free-ride. They show a strong norm of “everyone should give the max,” but their own contribution behavior does not fluctuate when that norm is violated; they punish instead of reducing their own contributions.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThey are highly engaged, humorous, and socially oriented. From the start, they frame cooperation as obvious and desirable, use light jokes and memes, and riff on others’ comments. They reference studies, bots, researchers, and movie/Internet culture, treating the game as both a social experiment and a social space. They actively coordinate norms (max contributions, targeting the deviant bird, later suspicion of owl) but with playful rather than domineering tone. They respond quickly to others, pick up others’ ideas (e.g., “rotate police,” democracy vs bot), and help maintain group cohesion when frustration rises about pay or duration. They openly share some private info (their coin total) when others do. They engage in mild meta-commentary about fairness of compensation but do not use that as a reason to defect. Overall they communicate as a sociable, group-identity-focused player who likes collective narratives (“new society,” “researcher troll,” “democracy is non‑negotiable”) and uses chat to keep morale and coordination high.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey are very willing to punish, including at substantial personal cost. Their early punishment targets the lowest contributor, consistent with enforcing a contribution norm. Once the “angry bird” (Parrot) emerges as a repeated low contributor and exploiter, they repeatedly punish it, including several high-intensity bursts that meaningfully reduce their own payoff. They explicitly express a motive of “justice,” talk about needing to “destroy” the deviant, and join coalition punishments when others propose coordinated hits. Deterrence and norm enforcement appear primary: they do not punish random players or high contributors, and they join group calls to sanction those who are seen as bots, trolls, or norm violators. However, their punishment of Owl at the very end is more suspicion- and frustration-driven than strictly payoff-based; Owl’s earlier behavior is mixed, and the trigger seems to be Owl suddenly doing very well combined with low contributions in a late round and other players calling them “sus.” That suggests they also punish to restore perceived social fairness, even with incomplete information.\n\nThey do not appear to use punishment as retaliation for being punished themselves (they are almost never targeted) nor as strategic intimidation for future gains; instead they accept that punishing costs them “real money” and continue anyway, suggesting strong non-monetary preferences for norm enforcement and group justice. They occasionally talk about “democracy” and “justice” in the same breath, and they coordinate with others before punishing, but they are also willing to act independently when they feel a violator must be sanctioned.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey reward infrequently but in a targeted, relational way. When they do reward, they focus on Gorilla, who is the most visibly “perma police” enforcer against the deviant bird. They explicitly say they top up Gorilla and later reward them again, essentially subsidizing Gorilla’s costly enforcement. This suggests they use rewards as gratitude and as strategic reinforcement of prosocial punishment rather than for pure equality or random generosity. They do not reward high contributors in general or the group at large; rewards cluster on a single ally. They also seem attentive to rewards they receive from others, mentioning when they notice being rewarded by the bird and interpreting it as information about the bird’s identity or strategy rather than just a payoff bump. Overall they are much more inclined to spend on punishment than on reward; reward is reserved for acknowledging and supporting those they see as aligned enforcers.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey closely monitor others’ contributions, payoffs, and reward/punishment histories and actively interpret them. They quickly label low contributors or odd patterns as “sus,” “researcher,” or “bot” and suggest or join group actions against them. They notice when someone gets unusually high payoffs, when a deviant avoids punishment, who is being rewarded, and how many coins the bird spends on reward vs punishment. That information shapes their beliefs: they oscillate between thinking the bird is a non-human bot, a researcher, or a “genius criminal,” and they occasionally question whether punishing the bird is economically wise. Despite grasping the low monetary return, they continue to punish, prioritizing symbolic fairness and group narrative over strict earnings.\n\nThey react positively to others’ high contributions and cooperative talk, reinforcing the “we’re all in this together” frame, and they do not retaliate against peers who briefly under-contribute if those peers correct themselves and align with group norms. They also respond to others’ exhaustion and concerns about underpayment with jokes and shared frustration, but without reducing their own contributions. Toward the end, as the game drags on, they become more impatient and slightly darker in humor (e.g., “kill owl”), but still keep cooperating and directing punishment toward those perceived as exploiting or gaming the system. Overall, they are a high-cooperation, high-enforcement, socially attuned “justice enforcer with a sense of humor,” who tracks outcomes carefully and uses both punishment and selective reward to shape group norms, even when that behavior is privately costly."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a predominantly high contributor who mixes genuine cooperation with calculated free-riding. They usually give the full endowment when the group appears cohesive and generous, but intermittently drop their contribution well below the group norm to exploit others’ cooperation.\n\nTheir contribution pattern is moderately volatile rather than stable. Periods of full cooperation are punctuated by occasional medium contributions and a few very low or zero contributions. These reductions do not follow a simple “tit-for-tat” with individual defectors; instead, they reflect opportunistic tests of how much they can keep while still benefiting from a generally cooperative group.\n\nThey appear to understand that the public good is highly efficient and that full contribution is socially optimal, as evidenced by their repeated willingness to match a high-contribution environment. At the same time, they are clearly attentive to payoff differences and are willing to trade off social efficiency for personal gain when it looks safe to do so. This indicates a blend of cooperative preference and self-interested optimization rather than pure altruism or pure free-riding.\n\nFairness norms seem conditional and asymmetric. The player is willing to contribute fully for long stretches even when an isolated peer defects, suggesting a tolerance for some level of unfairness or a focus on maintaining group output over immediate reciprocity. However, when the group remains very cooperative, they sometimes drop their own contribution sharply while others keep contributing at or near the maximum. In those moments they violate strict equality norms in their own favor, implying that fairness is not a dominant motive when it conflicts strongly with personal payoff.\n\nThey show some responsiveness to visible defections but not in a purely retaliatory way. Isolated low contributions by others do not reliably trigger immediate punishment via their own defection; instead, the player continues to contribute highly through several such events and only occasionally reduces their own contribution later. This delayed and inconsistent adjustment suggests exploratory or profit-maximizing tinkering rather than emotionally driven reciprocity.\n\nRisk tolerance appears moderate. The player is willing to risk being the lone free-rider in an otherwise cooperative group in order to earn high payoffs, which involves reputational or moral risk in many PGG contexts (even though no sanctions are available here). Yet they do not persistently defect; they revert frequently to full contributions, indicating caution about undermining the group’s cooperative equilibrium and the resulting efficiency loss. Overall, their persona fits a “strategic conditional cooperator with opportunistic leanings”: someone who prefers and sustains high cooperation but intermittently exploits it when they see a chance to personally gain without immediately collapsing the group’s contributions."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThe player tends to contribute a moderate, compromise-sized share of their endowment rather than fully free-riding or fully cooperating. Their behavior suggests a balancing motive: they value contributing to the group project but ensure they retain a substantial private payoff. They do not appear to follow a strict “all or nothing” rule; instead, they adopt a middle-ground level that is clearly cooperative relative to a pure defector, but noticeably below the highest observed contributions.\n\nThis pattern is consistent with a conditional or norm-sensitive cooperator who is uncertain about group behavior and hedges against the risk of being exploited. They appear willing to support the public fund even without direct mechanisms for punishment or reward, implying some intrinsic or norm-based preference for cooperation. At the same time, they do not sacrifice to the maximum extent, indicating concern for personal payoff, potential skepticism about full-group cooperation, or simple risk aversion.\n\nBecause only a single decision is observed and the game has only one round, the stability of this contribution level over time, and how it would adapt to different group behaviors, is unknown. Their underlying fairness norm likely centers on “shared responsibility” rather than strict equality or full altruism: they contribute a meaningful portion but do not voluntarily match the highest contributors. Their risk tolerance appears moderate—willing to invest in the public fund but not to the extent of staking everything on others’ cooperation. Overall, they fit a “moderate, norm-aware cooperator” type with some self-interested restraint and with conditionality and long-run adaptation remaining unknown due to limited data."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a mostly cooperative, mildly opportunistic contributor who oscillates between full cooperation and free-riding rather than settling into a single mode. They consistently choose only the extremes (all or nothing) available to them, suggesting a clear understanding of the binary decision and no apparent randomization.\n\nAfter an initially self-interested start, they quickly move toward frequent full contributions and maintain a generally high cooperative level for most of the game. They do, however, periodically insert zero-contribution rounds even while others are contributing heavily, indicating a willingness to exploit strong group cooperation when it is already established. These defection episodes do not escalate into a breakdown of cooperation, and the player returns to full contributions afterward, so they do not appear committed to systematic free-riding.\n\nTheir behavior is conditionally cooperative in a loose sense: they are much more likely to contribute when group cooperation is high or improving, but they still occasionally defect in exactly those high-cooperation environments, apparently to capture short-term gains without triggering collapse. They do not appear highly sensitive to single individuals’ deviations from the group; they continue contributing even when some others free-ride, as long as overall cooperation remains strong.\n\nThey show moderate fairness concern: they are willing to bear an individual cost by contributing when others on average also contribute, but they also take advantage of cooperative clusters without compensating for earlier free-riding. They do not display strict “eye-for-an-eye” reciprocity or stringent equity norms; instead, they tolerate some asymmetry as long as their own payoffs remain high.\n\nRisk tolerance appears moderate. They are willing to contribute even when there is visible heterogeneity in group behavior, implying acceptance of the risk that others might exploit them. However, they occasionally protect themselves by not contributing in otherwise cooperative environments, which functions as a hedge against being “too altruistic” relative to peers. There is no evidence of extreme risk aversion or of reckless unconditional giving.\n\nOverall, their contribution pattern suggests a “cooperative profiteer”: someone who prefers high cooperation and usually supports it but intermittently takes calculated advantage of the cooperative environment.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThe player is clearly aware of the game horizon and does not follow a simple “endgame defection” script. There is no monotonic decay of contributions as the final rounds approach; instead, their pattern near the end remains mixed, combining cooperative and exploitative moves.\n\nIn the last segment of the game, they continue to frequently choose full contributions even when approaching the final round, indicating that they do not shift to pure self-interest just because the game is ending. They still insert isolated free-riding moves late, but these look like local tactical deviations rather than a general endgame collapse of cooperation. The final decision is fully cooperative, which is inconsistent with a classic backward-induction defector and more consistent with someone who either (a) maintains a cooperative self-image or (b) believes the marginal benefit from that final contribution, given the group’s behavior, remains worthwhile.\n\nTheir horizon awareness is present (the interface makes remaining rounds visible), but their actions suggest that they either discount textbook endgame reasoning or prioritize sustaining a cooperative standard up to the end over strictly maximizing final-round private payoff. If they are applying any forward-looking strategy, it appears to be: “continue mostly cooperating as long as group cooperation remains high, with occasional opportunistic defection,” rather than “systematically wind down cooperation as the end nears.”\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThe player regularly sees others’ contributions and payoffs and appears to track overall group performance rather than focusing on specific individuals’ gains. They continue to contribute at high levels even when some named peers systematically free-ride in multiple rounds, which suggests that observing those higher payoffs for defectors does not trigger immediate retaliation or withdrawal from contributing. They seem more responsive to the aggregate cooperation level and the general payoff environment than to fine-grained payoff comparisons between individuals.\n\nWhen the group is highly cooperative and everyone’s payoffs are strong, the player is willing to join that pattern and often sustain it, despite knowing that prior free-riding has already given them a personal advantage. This indicates that envy or negative reciprocity based on others’ high payoffs is limited; they do not punish high earners by reducing their own contributions when those high earnings come from cooperative behavior. At the same time, periods where defectors earn more than contributors do not eliminate their willingness to resume cooperating later, implying that they tolerate payoff inequality, at least when overall earnings remain high.\n\nSince punishment and reward mechanisms are unavailable and unused, there is no direct evidence of their propensity to sanction or reward others. Based on contribution behavior alone, their response to others’ outcomes is relatively forgiving and aggregate-focused: as long as the group outcome remains good, they do not appear to react strongly against defectors or to “correct” payoff imbalances through their own future contributions. Their adaptation is weakly conditional—some opportunistic free-riding emerges in cooperative phases—but they do not escalate that into a breakdown of cooperation or seek to match defectors’ behavior one-for-one."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a highly stable, near-unconditional full cooperator in repeated PGGs, with a clear but very limited end-game defection. Across essentially the entire game, they consistently choose the maximal contribution available rather than free-riding, even when others around them sometimes keep their endowment and receive higher payoffs.\n\nThey treat contribution as the default rather than as something to be calibrated round by round. Their behavior does not track short-term variations in group cooperation: they continue to fully contribute through periods where some others contribute nothing and reap higher individual payoffs. This indicates that they prioritize the efficiency and fairness of the public outcome over immediate relative gains.\n\nTheir cooperation style fits a “principled high contributor” more than a purely payoff-maximizing conditional cooperator. They appear willing to accept being exploited by intermittent free-riders as a cost of maintaining a high-contribution environment, at least as long as the overall group remains moderately cooperative.\n\nThe one clear deviation is an abrupt switch to zero contribution only at the very final opportunity, despite the group contributing fully. This pattern suggests that they understand the incentive structure and the finite horizon: they know that defection in the last interaction is individually profitable and cannot be disciplined in the future. They maintain cooperation up to that point either due to norm adherence, long-run payoff thinking, or both.\n\nGiven the high multiplier, their behavior is compatible with someone who recognizes that full contribution is socially efficient and likely also individually profitable if others mostly cooperate. Their persistent full contributions, even when nontrivial free-riding exists, suggest relatively low risk-aversion with respect to being exploited, and/or a strong preference for sustaining a cooperative norm rather than reacting defensively.\n\nOverall, they are best characterized as a cooperative, norm-oriented player who understands but largely resists the temptation to free-ride, yielding only at the very end when future interactions no longer matter.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThe player clearly exhibits horizon awareness: they maintain maximal cooperation through the entire finite horizon and then exploit the final round by withholding contribution while others continue to give fully.\n\nThey do not show any gradual decay of cooperation as the end approaches. Instead, their pattern is “all-cooperate until the last chance, then defect once.” This suggests that, in their internal reasoning, backward induction is applied only at the terminal point, not recursively extended to earlier rounds. They seem willing to preserve cooperative dynamics while there is any continuation value, even if the number of remaining rounds becomes small.\n\nThis late defection is not driven by observed collapse of group cooperation; it occurs when the group is actually at its most uniformly cooperative. That points to a deliberate, payoff-aware final-round strategy rather than a reactive response to others. It is consistent with a player who accepts cooperative norms during the repeated phase but views the last period as a permissible or even “rationally justified” moment to secure an individual bonus, given the absence of future repercussions.\n\nIn new environments, this suggests that the player is likely to uphold high cooperation until they perceive that the interaction is definitively ending and then consider opportunistic defection on the final move. If the horizon is uncertain or indefinite, their behavior is more likely to remain cooperative, since the clean “last round” anchor is absent.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThe player observes detailed information about others’ contributions and payoffs but shows no behavioral adjustment that mirrors short-term inequities. Even when some peers repeatedly earn more by not contributing, the focal player continues to fully contribute. This suggests a relatively low sensitivity to disadvantageous inequality in the short run, at least within the levels experienced here.\n\nThey do not appear to update their strategy in response to specific individuals’ behavior; their contribution pattern stays the same whether particular peers free-ride intermittently or the group is close to universally cooperative. This indicates that they are not using a tit-for-tat or “conditional on average contribution” rule in any fine-grained way, even though they could. Instead, they effectively follow a simple heuristic: maintain full cooperation throughout the repeated interaction, ignoring minor opportunism, and then exploit only the final, non-punishable opportunity.\n\nBecause no punishment or reward is available, we learn about their reaction to outcomes solely from their contribution choices. Their indifference to short-run exploitation implies tolerance and a willingness to absorb occasional unfair outcomes for the sake of a high public good level. They do not make visible efforts to discipline free-riders through reduced contributions, even when doing so would be individually understandable.\n\nIn sum, their response to others’ outcomes is muted and norm-maintaining during the repeated phase and becomes payoff-maximizing only at the terminal point, when others’ future responses are irrelevant."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a mostly high-contribution, efficiency‑oriented conditional cooperator with occasional opportunistic free-riding. After a few early switches between giving nothing and giving everything, the player settles into a strong pattern of full contributions, only rarely deviating to keep the entire endowment. The contribution level tracks group behavior: when the rest of the group appears reliably generous, the player almost always contributes fully, suggesting a belief that others will continue to cooperate and that high group efficiency is desirable. The rare zero contributions occur in an otherwise stable high-contribution profile and tend to coincide with contexts where free-riding is especially profitable, indicating that the player is aware of payoff incentives and is willing to exploit them episodically. There is no evidence of gradual decay in cooperation over the game; instead, contributions remain predominantly high through the middle and late phases. The player does not insist on strict payoff equality and appears comfortable earning either more or less than specific peers, as long as the general cooperative norm is upheld. Risk tolerance is moderate: the player is willing to risk being the one who contributes in an environment with a few persistent defectors, but only after observing that the majority cooperates and that cooperative behavior is relatively stable over time.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThe player displays clear awareness of the finite horizon, as the number of remaining rounds is visible, but does not follow a standard backward‑induction pattern. Cooperation is maintained at a high level across the late game, with only a small increase in opportunistic defection near the end. The player alternates between contribution and non‑contribution a few times even in later stages, showing that they are still sensitive to short‑term payoff opportunities, yet they do not collapse into full defection as the final round approaches. In the very last round, the player contributes fully despite having no future to protect, suggesting either a preference for ending on a cooperative note, a stable cooperative identity, or a heuristic like “keep doing what works” rather than explicit end-game optimization. Overall, horizon awareness does not strongly erode their willingness to contribute; if anything, their strategy in the end-game remains largely consistent with their mid‑game cooperative stance, only punctuated by isolated free-riding choices.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThe player closely tracks group outcomes—seeing others’ contributions and payoffs—yet responds more to the general pattern of group cooperation than to the specific earnings of particular individuals. When most others contribute fully, the player typically reciprocates by contributing fully as well, indicating a belief that high group contributions are self‑reinforcing and payoff‑effective. The presence of a few consistent free‑riders does not provoke an aggressive retaliatory shift to permanent defection; instead, the player tolerates some exploitation as long as the aggregate contribution remains high enough to yield strong returns. There is no punishment or reward mechanism used in this game, so direct reactive behavior via sanctions or bonuses is impossible; correspondingly, there is no evidence of targeted responses to individual payoffs. The player’s intermittent free-riding episodes appear driven by the overall payoff opportunity—taking advantage of the cooperative environment—rather than by emotional reactions to any particular peer’s higher or lower payoff. Their style is thus best characterized as pragmatic conditional cooperation with occasional self-serving exploitation, guided by group-level outcome perceptions rather than fine-grained fairness enforcement toward specific others."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThe player is a mostly stable high contributor with an initial exploratory selfish streak. After briefly free-riding early on, they switch to full cooperation and maintain it almost without exception. Their default in this setting is to contribute the entire endowment when others’ cooperation appears reasonably high and persistent.\n\nContribution behavior is weakly conditional and path-dependent. They begin by exploiting a cooperative group, then rapidly converge on full contributions despite the ongoing presence of a few low contributors. Once they commit to cooperation, they tolerate some free-riding from others without retaliating by reducing their own contributions. This suggests a threshold-based conditional cooperator: as long as the overall contribution level remains high, they keep contributing fully, even if a minority of players defect.\n\nThey display moderate fairness concern but prioritize group efficiency over strict payoff equity. They do not try to equalize payoffs by strategically free-riding when others contribute more; instead, they accept that some players earn more by defecting while still maintaining their own cooperative pattern. This points to a “cooperative pragmatist” rather than a strong inequity-averse type.\n\nRisk tolerance appears moderate to high in the social domain: they are willing to risk being exploited by persistent defectors in order to maintain a large, efficient public good. The early free-riding suggests they understand and are willing to exploit the payoff structure when it is clearly advantageous, but their later behavior shows a preference for the stable, high-payoff cooperative equilibrium once it seems secure.\n\nOverall, the persona is: “early opportunistic learner who settles into robust high cooperation,” with cooperation that is anchored on group-level norms rather than finely tuned to each individual’s behavior.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThe player shows no evidence of end-game unraveling. Cooperation does not decay as the final rounds approach; instead, they continue full contributions through to the last round. They appear fully aware of the finite horizon (the interface makes remaining rounds salient), yet they do not exploit the final rounds by switching to defection.\n\nThis pattern indicates that they either (a) value sustaining cooperation and predictable group outcomes more than squeezing out extra end-game profit, or (b) heuristically stick to the cooperative strategy once adopted, without recalculating incentives for the final rounds. In either case, their strategy is time-stable: the approach used in the middle of the game is preserved at the end, with no special “last-round” deviation.\n\nThus, in new environments with a known endpoint, they are likely to maintain cooperation until the very end if they perceive the group as generally cooperative, rather than engaging in rational backward induction to defect as the game closes.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThe player clearly attends to others’ outcomes and contributions (the interface highlights them), but their behavioral adjustments are minimal after the first few rounds. Initially, upon seeing that most others are contributing high while a few defect, they experiment once with free-riding and then move into steady full contributions. From that point on, they do not mirror the behavior of defectors nor try to punish them indirectly by lowering their own contributions, even though this would increase their personal payoff.\n\nThis implies a relatively forgiving, non-retaliatory stance toward unilateral defection. The presence of consistent low contributors, including some who systematically earn higher payoffs, does not trigger the player to abandon cooperation. They seem to anchor more on the majority pattern than on a few outliers: as long as the group-level public good remains large and stable, they accept some inequity in outcomes.\n\nThere is no opportunity in this design for explicit punishment or reward, so their direct response to others’ payoffs in terms of sanctions is unknown. However, their lack of negative reciprocity via contribution cuts suggests they do not strongly prioritize punishing free-riders when it would require sacrificing group efficiency.\n\nIn sum, this player is best characterized as a majority-focused conditional cooperator: they adapt very early to a cooperative environment, then heavily weight the overall level of group cooperation and efficiency, showing high tolerance for a minority of exploiters and no tendency to engineer end-game or retaliatory shifts in strategy."

When others are consistently cooperative, they are generally cooperative too, but they also occasionally exploit those cooperative phases by free-riding. After very low personal returns from being the only or dominant contributor, they temporarily withhold contributions, but this withholding is not permanent; they later return to full cooperation when others again appear willing to contribute.\n\nFrom a fairness and norm perspective, they appear to value mutual cooperation and seem comfortable with outcomes where everyone benefits similarly, even if they themselves sometimes earn less than they could by defecting. However, they do not behave as a strict fairness enforcer or unconditional altruist: they are willing to capitalize on cooperative others by defecting when it is clearly profitable, and they do not refuse such gains. Their fairness norm is thus flexible and context-sensitive rather than rigid.\n\nRisk-wise, they accept the risk of cooperating in uncertain environments and tolerate being exposed to exploitation for multiple periods. At the same time, their selective free-riding shows that, when evidence accumulates that cooperation is fragile or exploitable, they are willing to reduce that risk and protect their own payoff.

Their default appears to be full contribution: across the interaction they more often choose to contribute than not, including in several situations where others do not fully match their cooperation. They do not immediately switch to permanent defection when encountering low contributions; instead, they continue to cooperate in multiple later opportunities even after experiencing profitable free-riding and periods of weak group cooperation. This suggests a cooperative orientation that is resilient, but not rigid.\n\nStability is moderate: the player’s pattern alternates between stretches of full contribution and occasional zero-contribution “tests” or opportunistic turns. These zero contributions tend to occur after they have recently seen that others are willing to contribute, indicating conditionality: they are more willing to free-ride once the group has demonstrated cooperative tendencies, and less willing to defect when others have just been uncooperative. However, they do not implement a simple “mirror” or tit-for-tat rule; they sometimes continue to contribute even when others’ contributions are low, implying that they tolerate some level of unfairness or noise before abandoning cooperation.\n\nTheir behavior reflects an awareness of payoff structure and a willingness to exploit beneficial situations. When the environment is cooperative, they sometimes take advantage by contributing nothing while still benefiting from others’ inputs. Yet they return to contributing afterward, which suggests that they are not purely payoff-maximizing in a narrow, short-term sense. Instead, they appear to trade off between personal gain and sustaining a cooperative environment, tolerating some personal disadvantage at times and taking advantage at others.\n\nOn fairness norms, the player appears flexible and somewhat self-serving. They do not insist on strict equality of effort: they continue to contribute fully even when they are doing more than some partners, and they allow themselves to free-ride when others do more. This points to a “lenient but opportunistic” fairness standard—cooperation is good and often worth maintaining, but exploiting clear opportunities for higher payoff is acceptable, especially once others have shown cooperativeness.\n\nRisk tolerance appears moderate to high. Since the marginal per-capita return is above the individual return from keeping the endowment, full contribution is individually risky only in the sense that others may not reciprocate. The player repeatedly chooses cooperation even after seeing that the group is not always fully cooperative, implying comfort with the risk that others might defect and reduce their payoff. At the same time, intermittent defection shows that they manage downside risk by occasionally securing guaranteed higher private payoffs when the group is cooperative enough to sustain it. Overall, they behave as a conditional cooperator with opportunistic free-riding tendencies, willing to accept some risk and some inequity to pursue both cooperation and profit."

Across the game, they choose the maximum contribution in the majority of rounds and seem comfortable with the efficient, fully cooperative outcome when others also contribute. Their pattern is not strictly stable: they occasionally contribute nothing in otherwise cooperative environments, suggesting willingness to exploit the public good at times or to express frustration via non-contribution.\n\nTheir deviations from full contribution appear conditional, not random. When another player systematically under-contributes, they sometimes respond by also withholding their own contribution and by escalating punishment. This indicates a fairness-oriented conditional strategy: they prefer mutual full contribution but are willing to sacrifice efficiency to punish or protest against perceived free-riding.\n\nThey appear to understand the payoff structure at least at a basic, behavioral level: they repeatedly return to full contribution after episodes of conflict, and they maintain full contribution throughout many cooperative stretches, implying they perceive that mutual cooperation is profitable. Risk tolerance seems moderate: they invest heavily in punishment at times, absorbing substantial short-term payoffs losses, but they otherwise play a fairly straightforward cooperative strategy rather than trying intricate exploitation patterns.\n\nOverall, they fit a “conditional cooperator with punitive streak” type: they default to maximal contribution when others appear cooperative but are willing to suspend cooperation when angered by persistent defection or when trying to discipline an outlier.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThe player engages in light, somewhat sarcastic conversation and is socially responsive rather than withdrawn. Early on, they verbally endorse the group proposal to all contribute fully and accept the cooperative norm set by others. Their tone ranges from casual and humorous to mildly hostile when criticizing an apparent free-rider, showing that they use chat both for social bonding and for social sanctioning.\n\nThey do not lead coordination or provide detailed instructions; instead, they follow others’ coordination attempts and occasionally comment on others’ behavior or the avatars. Their explanation about having “pressed the wrong button” after being praised for punishment reads more like a face-saving or humorous remark than a serious claim of confusion, given that their actual contribution pattern is already largely cooperative. This suggests they occasionally manage impressions or downplay their own intentional deviations.\n\nThey respond when spoken to and acknowledge group dynamics, but they do not actively negotiate complex strategies, monetary calculations, or long-term plans. Their communication style is engaged but not dominant, emotionally expressive but not fully confrontational, and aligned with maintaining a cooperative group identity with some playful antagonism toward defectors.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThere is no clear evidence of a strong end-game unraveling in their contributions. They continue to choose the maximum contribution in most of the later rounds and do not show a monotonic decline as the game approaches its final stages. Instances of zero contribution later in the game coincide with broader breakdowns in group cooperation, not specifically with the known horizon.\n\nThey appear aware of the structure (rounds are numbered and discussed by others), but their behavior does not show a systematic “it’s almost over, so I defect” strategy. Instead, their late-game choices oscillate with group behavior: they defect in one late round during a wider collapse in contributions and return to full contribution once cooperation resumes. Their final round behavior remains cooperative even though the incentive to defect is highest, suggesting either a stable internal norm for contributing or continued desire to align with the cooperative majority more than a horizon-focused payoff maximization.\n\nGiven the limited direct evidence, their horizon awareness is unknown, but their behavior is more consistent with norm-following than with calculated end-game exploitation.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThe player is a frequent and heavy user of punishment, willing to incur large personal costs to sanction perceived free-riders. They do not punish indiscriminately across all rounds: their punishment expenditures cluster around periods when one or more players visibly contribute nothing while the rest of the group cooperates. This timing suggests that punishment is primarily triggered by norm violations (under-contribution relative to the group), not by random aggression.\n\nThey are willing to target at least one focal low contributor intensely, investing enough coins into punishment to significantly reduce their own payoffs. This indicates that, at times, they prioritize enforcing fairness or expressing disapproval over immediate monetary gain. When group cooperation breaks down more broadly and multiple players start contributing nothing, their punishment intensity drops to zero, even though opportunities for punishment remain. That pattern is consistent with a deterrence goal: when there is no longer a clear cooperative norm or deviant minority, punishing becomes less meaningful to them.\n\nRetaliatory motives cannot be ruled out—this player is themselves punished in some of the same episodes in which they use heavy punishment, and the mutual deductions may reflect tit-for-tat dynamics. However, the structure of their punishment (focusing on contributors who are consistently at zero when others are cooperative) is more aligned with norm-enforcement than with blind revenge. They thus fit a “strong norm enforcer” type who uses punishment aggressively when they see a single or small set of deviants in an otherwise cooperative group and largely refrains once norms collapse.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nThe player receives nontrivial punishment in several rounds, including ones where they themselves deviate from full contribution. Their observable reaction is mixed: on the one hand, they do not engage in overt verbal retaliation against specific punishers and do not name or accuse them in chat. On the other hand, they continue to punish heavily even while being punished, indicating that they do not back down in response to sanctions and do not immediately shift to a more conciliatory, cooperative posture toward those who punish them.\n\nThey briefly offer a humorous or face-saving explanation about “pressing the wrong button” after another player praises their punitive actions. This remark comes after a period where they both deviated from the contribution norm and used strong punishment, and after they had been punished themselves. This suggests that when confronted socially with their behavior, they prefer to diffuse tension with humor or plausible deniability rather than directly admit exploitative or spiteful intent.\n\nThey do not appear to systematically retaliate directly against punishers as punishers; instead, their punishment pattern stays tied to contribution behavior, not to who punished them. Compliance with norms after being punished is partial: they return to full contribution in many subsequent rounds, but this also coincides with a reestablishment of group cooperation, so it is unclear whether they are responding to punishment, group expectations, or their own preferences. Overall, they show a combination of stubbornness (continuing to use punishment despite being punished) and social smoothing (joking explanations) rather than clear submissive compliance or vindictive counter-punishment."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a generally high contributor who occasionally free-rides in a calculated way. For most of the game they give the full endowment, even when a substantial minority of others withhold. They are not rigidly unconditional, however: on some occasions they keep the entire endowment while others mostly contribute. These free-riding choices are intermittent and do not follow a simple monotonic pattern of decay; cooperation remains the default, with defection used sparingly.\n\nTheir contributions appear only weakly conditional on others’ behavior. They continue to give fully even when several players consistently contribute nothing and earn higher payoffs from the public account. The player shows no clear attempts to match the current group average or to punish low group contributions via their own withholding. Instead, they seem guided by an internal cooperative norm combined with occasional opportunistic self-interest.\n\nThey do not appear to follow a strict fairness or equality norm in contributions. They tolerate persistent asymmetries where some earn more by free-riding, yet they still often contribute. This suggests either a pro-social preference that overrides payoff inequality or a strategic belief that maintaining cooperation is overall beneficial, even if some exploit it.\n\nRisk tolerance is moderate: they repeatedly invest the whole endowment despite uncertainty about others’ future cooperation and in the presence of visible defectors. The occasional switches to non-contribution indicate they are not naively altruistic; they are willing to test or exploit situations where their own payoff can be boosted, but these episodes do not escalate into full defection.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThere is no strong end-game collapse in cooperation. The player continues to contribute in the late stage, alternating between contribution and free-riding roughly as they do earlier. They do not display a clear pattern of “saving” all endowment in the very last several rounds; instead, end-game behavior resembles mid-game behavior with some mixed choices.\n\nAwareness of the horizon does not obviously change their strategy. They neither dramatically increase generosity in the final rounds nor shift decisively into pure self-interest. If anything, they maintain a “business as usual” approach, suggesting either limited strategic anticipation of the finality or a preference-based motive for cooperation that is relatively horizon-independent.\n\n<REWARD>\nThis player is a frequent and heavy user of the reward mechanism. They repeatedly pay non-trivial costs to give positive transfers across many rounds. Rewarding is not uniform: sometimes they spend nothing, sometimes they spend a modest amount, and in several instances they incur relatively high total reward costs. Overall, they adopt a “motivational” style, using rewards as a central tool rather than as an occasional gesture.\n\nThe main trigger appears to be others’ cooperative or prosocial behavior, especially those who also reward or who contribute fully. Their pattern is consistent with targeted social reinforcement: they seem to single out perceived allies—high contributors and/or active rewarders—for positive feedback, rather than rewarding all cooperators indiscriminately. Their own spending sometimes exceeds the net reward they themselves receive, indicating that they are willing to incur real costs to sustain or encourage cooperation rather than merely to balance accounts.\n\nThey do not appear to use reward to equalize payoffs across the group. There is no sign of systematically boosting low earners or penalizing high earners by omission. Instead, they reward in a way that is compatible with alliance-building and reciprocity: returning favors, sustaining mutual supporters, and acknowledging cooperative partners. This suggests they view the reward mechanism as a strategic relational tool rather than as a fairness-corrective instrument.\n\nTheir willingness to spend on reward remains present even when it is not obviously profitable in a narrow, one-shot sense. This points to either a social preference for rewarding “good” behavior or a belief that repeated reinforcement can sustain higher cooperation over time.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThe player is sensitive to being rewarded and responds in ways consistent with positive reciprocity and alliance maintenance. When others grant them reward, they do not retaliate by withholding cooperation; instead, their default of contributing remains intact. They also continue or increase their own reward-giving after receiving substantial positive transfers, suggesting gratitude or a desire to reciprocate, although exact partner matching is unknown from the aggregate data.\n\nThey appear more inclined to use reward when there is an active reward culture in the group, especially involving certain recurring generous rewarders. This suggests they track who is investing in them and, at minimum, reciprocate at the group level: they stay within the rewarding “club” rather than free-riding on rewards once they are a beneficiary. There is no evidence of spite or punishment towards rewarders who might favor others; instead, they tolerate uneven incoming reward while still cooperating and sometimes spending on rewards themselves.\n\nThey do not appear to withdraw cooperation in response to being ignored or under-rewarded. Even in periods when they contribute and receive little or no reward compared to others, they mostly continue to cooperate and sometimes still spend on rewards. This implies a relatively robust cooperative disposition that is influenced, but not fully governed, by direct reciprocity.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThe player pays attention to others’ outcomes but responds more through positive reinforcement than through withdrawal of cooperation. They see that some low contributors consistently earn more thanks to the public good and incoming rewards from others, yet they do not systematically reduce their own contributions in protest. Nor do they obviously avoid rewarding those high-earning defectors in a clear, punitive pattern; their response is more about selectively rewarding those they perceive as “on their side” than about financially disciplining non-cooperators.\n\nThey show tolerance for payoff inequality: they maintain generous contributions even when some players accumulate far higher payoffs through minimal contributions and heavy incoming rewards. This indicates either low envy or a strategic belief that targeting allies is more effective than trying to correct the entire payoff distribution.\n\nAt the same time, they clearly adapt to the emerging social structure of the game. When some players start spending extremely large amounts on rewards to specific targets, this player does not mirror that extremity but continues with moderate reward use and cooperative play. This suggests a relatively stable, measured style: they are not easily drawn into costly reward escalations or status competitions, and they do not attempt to outspend others to change the payoff hierarchy.\n\nOverall, their reaction to what they observe is pragmatic rather than vindictive: they accept the presence of free-riders and payoff-skews, focus on maintaining mutually supportive ties, and only occasionally exploit opportunities by not contributing. Their type is best described as a cooperative, alliance-oriented rewarder who mixes in some opportunistic free-riding but avoids aggressive or punitive responses even in the face of others’ selfishness."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a conditional, profit-focused free-rider with intermittent cooperative “bursts.” They treat contribution as a tool rather than a norm. Across the game, they spend a meaningful but minority share of their rounds contributing fully, alternating between full contribution and full defection rather than mixing intermediate amounts (here, a binary choice).\n\nTheir baseline preference is to keep their endowment and live off others’ contributions. When others’ cooperation remains reasonably high without their help, they comfortably defect and accept the group benefit. They do not systematically match others’ behavior: they sometimes contribute fully in environments where free-riding would be clearly more profitable, and sometimes defect in moderately cooperative environments. This suggests they are not following a simple “contribute if enough others do” rule; instead, they appear to explore and periodically test how much cooperation they can induce or sustain, then revert to self-interest.\n\nThey do not display a rigid fairness norm. They are willing to contribute fully even when several peers free-ride, and also willing to free-ride when many peers contribute. This indicates they do not insist on contribution reciprocity before they contribute, nor do they insist on “no one should gain more than me” as a stable rule. Their behavior is better described as opportunistic and adaptive: they are sensitive to the payoff structure and willing to accept payoff inequality if it advantages them.\n\nRisk tolerance appears moderate. They sometimes choose the payoff-dominated cooperative action in environments where cooperation is fragile, which is risky if others defect, yet they never push this to an extreme sustained costly-cooperator pattern. They are not an unconditional cooperator or unconditional defector; instead, they oscillate, suggesting active learning and occasional risk-taking within an overall payoff-oriented frame.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThe player shows awareness of the horizon and gradually shifts toward more consistent free-riding as the game progresses, but does not switch to pure defection. In the final stretch, contributions become rarer and are interspersed with defection even when cooperation by others is still present. The last round itself is played as a free-rider, consistent with standard end-game unraveling logic.\n\nHowever, they do not exhibit a sharp, one-time end-game collapse. Rather, they move in and out of cooperative choices in late rounds, including at least one late cooperative burst despite the short remaining horizon. This suggests they understand that the game is finite and lean more toward self-interest near the end, but they also keep open the possibility of maintaining or exploiting a cooperative environment even late if it seems profitable or strategically interesting.\n\nThere is no clear evidence they are trying to build a reputation for future interactions beyond this game; with punishers being identifiable but no future interaction guaranteed after the final round, they do not make extra cooperative “gestures” at the end. Overall, they show partial end-game decay of cooperation, but not a strict backward-induction style collapse.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThis player is willing to punish and at times punishes quite heavily relative to their own payoff, but only in a subset of cooperative rounds. They never punish when they themselves defect; all observed punishment occurs when they are cooperating. This is consistent with a norm-enforcing or frustration-driven pattern: they are more likely to punish when they perceive themselves as “doing their part” and others not following suit.\n\nTheir punishment is not continuous or automatic. They sometimes cooperate in the presence of clear free-riders and do not punish at all, and at other times, in similarly mixed environments, they invest substantial resources into punishment. This inconsistency suggests that punishment is not governed by a strict threshold rule (e.g., “punish all defectors”); instead, it may be driven by situational emotion, salience of low contributors, or occasional attempts to reset group norms.\n\nPunishment episodes are sizable relative to their own income in those rounds, indicating they are at least temporarily willing to trade off personal payoff to sanction others. Because we do not observe the distribution of their punishment across specific peers, their selectivity toward particular individuals is unknown. However, the fact that they never punish while defecting themselves argues against “pure spite” or random aggression; they appear to reserve costly sanctions for situations in which they see themselves as justified enforcers rather than simultaneous free-riders.\n\nGiven that punishment is identifiable, they must anticipate possible retaliation, yet they still engage in it on multiple occasions. This implies either a taste for norm-enforcement or a belief that the deterrence/teaching effect outweighs the risk of being punished back. Whether their punishment actually changes others’ contributions is unknown.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nThe player is punished multiple times across the game, including in some rounds where they cooperate and some where they defect. Their response to being punished does not show clear compliance or clear retaliation.\n\nThey do not reliably increase contributions after being punished; in some cases, they subsequently defect, and in others they later cooperate again under different conditions. Thus, punishment does not lock them into cooperation. At the same time, they do not exhibit obvious counter-punishment patterns: they never punish in rounds where they are defecting, and they do not increase their use of punishment immediately after receiving deductions in a way that would clearly signal revenge. Because the identity of their punishers is not provided in the transcript, whether they specifically target those individuals is unknown and confidence in any retaliation inference is low.\n\nMore broadly, the player appears relatively thick-skinned regarding punishment. They continue to free-ride in later rounds despite having been sanctioned earlier, indicating they are not easily cowed into permanent cooperative compliance. Nor do they abandon cooperation entirely after being punished while cooperating; they still choose full contribution in later rounds. This suggests a pragmatic stance: punishment is treated as one data point in a noisy environment rather than a binding signal to change strategy.\n\nOverall, their response to punishers mixes partial disregard (they keep defecting when profitable) with occasional cooperative choices that are not tightly coupled to prior sanctions. They neither strongly appease nor systematically retaliate; instead, they maintain their opportunistic, mixed strategy largely independent of who has punished them before."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a stable, unconditional high contributor. They always contribute their full endowment, never deviating even when others free ride or partially defect. Their cooperation does not appear contingent on others’ behavior: they continue to contribute fully when some players give nothing, and also when everyone cooperates. They show no visible attempt to fine-tune contributions in response to individual defectors, instead treating contribution as a fixed norm. This suggests a strong intrinsic or norm-based preference for full cooperation rather than payoff-maximizing calculus. Risk tolerance appears high regarding potential exploitation: they persist with full contributions despite repeated evidence that at least one player is free riding and sometimes being rewarded overall. Fairness norms are present but are not expressed through adjusting their own contribution level; instead, fairness concerns show up in their initial punishment choice (see below) rather than in withholding contributions.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThe player never sends any chat messages. They neither initiate coordination nor respond verbally to others’ attempts at persuasion, humor, or social bonding. They are completely silent despite an active, social, and sometimes playful group chat environment. This is consistent with a highly task-focused or low-engagement communication style. They may be strategically “quiet cooperative”: participating through actions only, letting contribution and sanctioning speak for itself. There is no evidence of explicit norm signaling, emotional expression, or alliance-building through chat. Their non-participation in jokes and meta-discussion suggests either disinterest, deliberate neutrality, or a preference to avoid social influence or conflict in communication channels. Overall, they are behaviorally engaged but socially silent.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThe player’s cooperative strategy shows no end-game decay. They maintain full contributions through the final rounds, even when it is common-knowledge that the game is about to end. They do not appear to shift into selfish extraction near the end, and they also do not suddenly intensify use of punishment or reward as the horizon approaches. Their pattern of not using sanctions after the first period continues unchanged into the last period. This indicates that their cooperation is not driven primarily by long-term reciprocity or future-oriented incentives; instead, they behave as if full contribution is the appropriate action regardless of remaining rounds. Awareness of the horizon is given in the interface, but there is no behavioral sign that they strategically respond to it.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey punish only once and very heavily, targeting a player who contributed fully but was already being massively punished by others. They spend a substantial amount of their own payoff to further increase that player’s deductions. After this, they never punish again, even though several players later contribute nothing in multiple rounds. This single, early, high-intensity punishment is not obviously efficiency-oriented: the target is not a low contributor in that round, and the marginal deterrent value of further punishment is arguably low given the already extreme level imposed by others. The behavior fits a “bandwagon” or “pile-on” pattern: joining a collective punishment episode rather than independently evaluating contribution behavior that round. There is no evidence of targeted, proportional sanctioning tied strictly to current free riding; instead, the one observed punishment is extreme, socially aligned with others’ hostility to the same player, and then discontinued entirely. After this event, they seem to refrain from all further punitive action, even when future behavior (e.g., zero contributions by several players) would provide clear justifications under standard conditional-cooperation norms. Their punishment style is thus: highly willing to spend a lot in an initial social-punishment cascade, but not systematically enforcing norms thereafter. Motivation is ambiguous; it could be driven by early affect/identity cues from chat (others labeling someone negatively) rather than strictly by current contribution levels. Confidence on the exact motive is low.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nThey are never punished in the transcript. Consequently, their response to being punished is unknown. There is no evidence on whether they would retaliate, comply by changing contributions, or ignore sanctions if they occurred.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey never allocate rewards to anyone, despite many players contributing fully and some others using reward as positive reinforcement. They forgo low-cost opportunities to strengthen cooperation or reciprocate kindness through the reward channel, even when they themselves receive rewards. This consistent non-use of rewards suggests they either do not value the reward mechanism, prefer to conserve coins once the initial punishment burst is over, or treat contributions as self-sufficient signals that do not require extra reinforcement. There is no selective rewarding of high contributors, no alliance-like reward patterns, and no final-round “thank you” rewarding. The absence of any reward behavior contrasts with their early willingness to spend heavily on punishment, pointing toward a sanctioning style that is skewed (when active) toward negative rather than positive incentives.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThey receive small rewards in at least some rounds from several others, but they never reciprocate via rewards. They also do not shift their sanction behavior in favor of those who rewarded them, nor do they start rewarding cooperators more generally. Their contribution behavior remains unchanged (always full), and their punishment/reward behavior remains minimal after the first round. This indicates that they do not use the reward channel for reciprocity or alliance building, at least within the observed game. Their response to being rewarded is essentially behavioral inertia: they keep cooperating but do not “pay back” through the same mechanism. Whether they feel gratitude privately is unknown; observable reciprocity in rewards is absent.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey see detailed information about others’ payoffs, punishment, and reward flows. Their one major behavioral response to others’ outcomes is joining an early, extreme collective punishment episode against a single player who ends with a large negative payoff due to group sanctions. They contribute to that outcome by adding significant punishment of their own. After that, they do not visibly react to later variations in others’ outcomes: they do not step in to punish later free riders or to support cooperators with rewards, even when others clearly spend on such actions. They also do not alter their own contributions in response to any pattern of outcomes; they keep contributing fully regardless of who is being rewarded or punished and how payoffs are distributed. This suggests that they attend to others’ outcomes enough to join a salient early punishment cascade but then settle into a “cooperate and ignore” stance where payoff heterogeneity and sanction patterns no longer drive their behavior. Their sensitivity to social information seems front-loaded and not dynamically updated across later rounds, or at least does not manifest in further strategic changes.\n\n"

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a stable, unconditional high contributor. They always contribute the full endowment, never deviating even when some others contribute nothing or when free-riding is repeatedly visible. Their behavior aligns with a strong efficiency and cooperation norm: they appear to prioritize maximizing the group return over exploiting others. They show no evidence of conditional cooperation (they do not scale contributions down in response to defectors, nor up relative to others); instead they follow a simple “always all-in” rule. They seem comfortable bearing the risk of being exploited by low contributors and do not attempt to hedge against defection. Fairness concerns, if present, do not translate into adjusting contributions; they rely on other mechanisms (chiefly social norms and possibly punishment by others) to handle unfairness rather than altering their own cooperative stance.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nTheir communication is sparse, light, and affiliative rather than strategic. They greet others implicitly by joining in with the group’s “all in” norm and later explicitly endorse that norm with a brief statement supporting full contributions every time. They also participate in the playful “we are robots” banter with a humorous remark, signaling sociability and a desire to fit into the group mood rather than to lead or criticize. They do not directly confront low contributors or direct others to punish or reward; instead they echo the cooperative consensus that has already formed. They do not initiate substantive coordination about punishment or rewards, and they avoid moralistic or aggressive language. Overall, they engage enough to be seen as part of the cooperative in-group, but they do not attempt to shape group strategy in a forceful or detailed way.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThey show no end-game decay in cooperation. Their contribution level remains at the maximum right through the final round, even as the horizon becomes short and others continue to free-ride intermittently. They do not switch to opportunistic behavior despite having no future rounds in which to rebuild reputation or benefit from reciprocity. There is no evidence that they try to exploit last-round anonymity or to recoup earlier losses. This suggests either a rule-based or principled commitment to cooperation that is insensitive to the finite horizon, or at least a choice not to condition on it in practice. Their use of punishment and rewards does not intensify or strategically change at the end; after an early punishment they remain inactive in the sanctioning stage through the remainder of the game, including in the final round.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey punish exactly once, targeting a player who contributes fully in that period and has not clearly deviated in that round. The amount is minimal in the context of the game and is extremely small relative to the much larger punishment this target receives from others. The trigger for this punishment is ambiguous: it does not clearly correspond to immediate free-riding or to a contemporaneous breach of a cooperation norm. This makes the motive uncertain: it could be a mistaken click, a playful or bandwagon response to emerging hostility toward that player, or a weak expression of disapproval for prior noncooperative behavior. After this single act, they refrain from using punishment altogether, even when standard free-riding targets reappear and other players continue to punish them. They never engage in retaliatory punishment; they themselves are never punished, so their tolerance for personal provocation is unknown. Overall, they are best described as a very low-intensity, non-escalating punisher whose willingness to spend on punishment is limited and not clearly strategic.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nThey are never punished by any other player in the observed game, so their direct response to being punished is unknown. There is no evidence of preemptive appeasement or of retaliatory tendencies because they do not face any deductions. Their steady high contributions and non-use of late punishment suggest they are not trying to signal toughness or a readiness to retaliate, but this is inference with low confidence because no direct provocation occurs.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey never spend any resources on rewards. Even when others cooperate fully and some players reward them or other cooperators, they provide no positive reinforcement through the costly reward mechanism. This could reflect a preference to conserve payoff, skepticism about the efficacy of rewards, cognitive load/neglect of the reward option, or a belief that cooperation should be its own norm without needing side payments. Given that their contributions remain maximally cooperative, their lack of rewarding is not driven by selfish exploitation of others’ efforts, but rather by an apparent choice to rely on contribution behavior (and possibly group punishment) as the main cooperative device rather than spending additional coins on positive incentives.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThey receive a small reward from another player once. After that, they do not reciprocate with rewards to that player or to anyone else in subsequent rounds, nor do they change their contribution pattern (which was already fully cooperative). Their polite and humorous chat style suggests they are not hostile to the rewarder, but behaviorally they show no observable payoff-based reciprocity in the reward stage. They also do not publicly acknowledge or comment on having been rewarded, so any private feeling of gratitude is unobserved. In terms of observable strategy, they treat being rewarded as non-diagnostic: it does not alter their sanctioning decisions or their cooperative rule.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey appear relatively indifferent, behaviorally, to the detailed payoff and punishment/reward distributions of others. They see several cycles where specific low contributors are heavily punished by many players, and where some cooperators reward each other, yet they almost never join in sanctioning and never adjust their own contribution level. They do not speak up in chat to endorse or condemn the severity of punishment or the generosity of rewards, focusing instead on general cooperation slogans and light banter. They show no sign of targeting high earners, low earners, or heavy punishers/rewarders with any systematic pattern. The one early punishment they impose does not clearly track contemporaneous deviations, and they do not follow up on that target later even when that player’s outcomes remain salient. Overall, they attend enough to know that “all in” is good for the group and to participate in group identity talk, but they do not appear to engage in fine-grained tracking or management of others’ outcomes."

They understand that the group return on contributions is high, and they are clearly *willing* to contribute fully, but only in selected moments and not as a stable norm.\n\nTheir contributions are highly volatile rather than consistent. They alternate between:\n- full contributions,\n- complete free-riding,\n- and occasional intermediate amounts.\n\nThey reliably contribute more when there is a current or recent norm of high contributions from others, and they frequently drop to zero when others are also contributing substantially. This pattern suggests conditional cooperation in *timing* (joining or sustaining cooperative phases) mixed with opportunistic exploitation once a cooperative environment is in place.\n\nThey do not display a simple “tit-for-tat” response to any single individual; instead, their behavior appears keyed to the *overall* contribution climate. They sometimes rejoin high cooperation even after having just exploited others, indicating they value group efficiency or fairness at least intermittently, but they are willing to accept being the main beneficiary of the public good when they see that others continue to contribute.\n\nThere is no evidence they are strongly fairness-driven in a strict, consistent sense; they tolerate repeatedly earning more than cooperative peers. At the same time, they are not a pure low-contributor type: they repeatedly take on personally costly, high contributions even when free-riding is available. This points to mixed motives: some concern for group welfare or norm-following, combined with strong payoff-seeking.\n\nRisk tolerance appears moderate: they are willing to be the high contributor even when some group members are clearly free-riding, which risks ending up exploited, but they also periodically hedge by keeping all their own endowment. The pattern looks more like strategic cycling than random noise.\n\nOverall, they are best modeled as a sophisticated conditional cooperator who opportunistically times free-riding rather than adhering to a principled cooperative rule.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nTheir communication is sparse, direct, and cooperative at the outset. They immediately endorse a full-contribution plan proposed by another player and do so without hedging or negotiation. This shows readiness to coordinate around an efficient, pro-social norm when prompted by others, but they do not take a leadership role in proposing norms themselves.\n\nAfter that brief agreement, they remain silent for the rest of the game. They do not defend, justify, or explain their later free-riding, nor do they confront others about low contributions. This suggests a low-engagement or low-disclosure style: they prefer to adapt silently rather than manage social impressions or argue about fairness.\n\nThey are clearly reading the chat (since they respond once early), but there is no evidence they try to persuade, shame, or rally people in later phases. Socially, they come across as understated and pragmatic rather than expressive. Their willingness to initially endorse “everyone contributes everything” alongside later quiet free-riding indicates they do not strongly internalize the social commitments expressed in chat, or they are comfortable deviating without explanation once conditions change.\n\nIn terms of tone, their single message is neutral and cooperative. There is no observable hostility, sarcasm, or moralizing; beyond the initial assent to a cooperative norm, their communication gives little signal about their personality or emotional state. Motivation and reasoning must be inferred primarily from their contribution behavior rather than their words.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThey show awareness of the finite horizon in a behavioral sense: near the end, they do not shift into a pure “endgame free-ride everything” strategy. Instead, they continue to use mixed contributions, including both low and high amounts, right up to the final decision.\n\nIn the closing phase, they at times free-ride while many others contribute heavily, and at other times they themselves contribute fully when others also do so. This indicates that their behavior is not driven solely by backwards induction logic or simple endgame unraveling. They do not display a clear monotonic decay of cooperation toward the end; if anything, they sustain or even revive high contributions in the last decision.\n\nThis pattern suggests:\n- They may not be strategically optimizing specifically for the very last round.\n- They may still care about maintaining or re-establishing a cooperative environment even when no future interaction is left.\n- Alternatively, they may simply be following the same conditional/mixed rule throughout, without giving special weight to the horizon.\n\nBecause they do not comment on the number of rounds or on upcoming termination, their explicit beliefs about the end-game are unknown. Behaviorally, though, they are not a classic “end-game defector”: they continue to cooperate substantially in the final decisions despite knowing the game is about to end.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey appear to closely observe others’ contributions and resulting payoffs, but they never verbalize any reaction to individual outcomes. They neither praise high contributors nor complain about free-riders. There is no direct social sanctioning or reward through words, and no mechanism exists in this game for monetary punishment or reward, so all their responses must be inferred from their own subsequent contribution choices.\n\nBehaviorally, they are comfortable allowing others to earn less while they profit from free-riding. When many others contribute high amounts and accept lower private payoffs, they do not move immediately to “correct” this inequality; instead, they often maintain or adopt zero contributions and enjoy the payoff advantage. This tolerance for asymmetric outcomes suggests that envy or guilt, if present, are not strong enough to override their opportunistic play.\n\nHowever, they also sometimes take on the role of high contributor when others are also investing heavily, even though they have previously seen that such generosity can lead to them earning less than free-riders. This indicates that they are not purely outcome-maximizing in a myopic sense; they are willing to join the cooperative set even after having observed its vulnerability to exploitation. They may believe that re-creating or sustaining a high-contribution environment is still worthwhile for overall group returns, or they may place some intrinsic value on “doing their part” under the right conditions.\n\nThere is no sign that they adjust contributions in a targeted way in response to any particular player’s payoff; their responses track the *aggregate* pattern of contributions and payoffs rather than focusing on specific individuals. Emotional reactions such as resentment, sympathy, or moral approval are not expressed in chat, so their inner attitudes toward others’ outcomes remain unknown. The safest inference is that they primarily treat others’ outcomes as information about how cooperative the environment is and whether it is currently profitable or safe for them to either contribute or free-ride."

Instead, they appear to treat contribution as one tool among several for influencing group dynamics, not as a moral commitment.\n\nThey show no simple conditional rule like “I contribute if most others do” or “I contribute if I was punished.” They contribute in both cooperative and defect-heavy contexts, and they also free-ride in both. This indicates low adherence to a straightforward fairness norm such as strict conditional cooperation. Risk tolerance for social sanctions is moderate: they continue to alternate between contributing and defecting even when they are repeatedly punished, implying they accept or discount the risk of further sanctions rather than strictly complying.\n\nOverall, their contribution behavior fits an “experimenting enforcer” type: they treat their own contribution as secondary to their influence via punishment and reward, and they are willing to bear being seen as a defector at times.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nAwareness of the finite horizon does not lead to a simple end-game collapse or pure exploitation. In the final segment of the game they still mix contributions and defections and continue to use both costly punishment and reward, including in the very last round. They do not switch to purely selfish play or stop investing in social control when no future rounds remain, indicating that immediate material payoff is not their sole driver.\n\nThere is no visible trend toward systematically increasing or decreasing cooperation as the end approaches; instead, their pattern of alternating between contribution and free-riding persists. The continued willingness to spend on sanctions in the final rounds suggests they value expressing norms or “finishing the game right” over maximizing final-round income. This points to a stable preference for norm enforcement and signaling, rather than a strategy tightly optimized to the horizon.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThis player is a very heavy and frequent user of punishment. They impose sanctions in most rounds where the mechanism is available and often spend substantial amounts to do so. Their punishment is not narrowly focused on classic free-riders; they sometimes punish high contributors and sometimes punish defectors, and they target both frequent cooperators and frequent low contributors. This indicates that their criteria for punishment go beyond simple “punish non-contributors.”\n\nTheir targeting suggests several intertwined motives:\n\n- **Norm enforcement with a personal twist:** They regularly punish clear non-contributors who benefit from others’ cooperation, which is consistent with enforcing a contribution norm. At the same time, they also punish some cooperators and some players who appear neutral, which implies their norm is idiosyncratic, possibly based on a richer mental record of who has been “good” or “bad” earlier, including past punishment or reward decisions.\n\n- **Retaliation and score-settling:** They are themselves punished by multiple others, yet they persist in sanctioning those same players or their perceived allies. Because punishers are identifiable, the repetition of punishment against certain names, including some who have already been punished heavily by others, points to retaliatory or vindictive elements rather than purely forward-looking deterrence.\n\n- **Willingness to bear large costs:** They repeatedly spend on punishment even when it significantly reduces their own payoff in that round, and they do not stop doing so after experiencing large deductions from others. This shows a strong willingness to incur personal cost to impose harm, consistent with strong negative reciprocity and/or spite toward perceived norm violators.\n\nSelectivity is present but loose: they do not punish everyone, and they frequently pick out specific subsets of players each round. The pattern suggests they track reputations and use punishment both as a tool to express disapproval and as a way to “balance accounts,” rather than following a simple mechanical rule based only on current-round contributions.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nWhen punished, this player does not show clear compliance by aligning their behavior with punishers’ apparent preferences. Instead, they continue to alternate between contribution and free-riding and to use heavy punishment themselves. There is no consistent move toward safer, more conformist behavior after being targeted. This indicates low responsiveness to punishment as a deterrent and low deference to others’ attempts at control.\n\nThey also do not clearly stop punishing those who punish them; some of their punishment choices are consistent with retaliating against players who had previously imposed costs on them, but the mapping is not one-to-one and cannot be asserted with high confidence. Overall, however, their persistent and sometimes escalating sanctioning despite being hit themselves suggests they are not easily cowed and may even regard being punished as part of a conflict they are willing to continue.\n\nForgiveness versus grudges remains ambiguous. Because they both punish and reward many of the same players across time, it is unclear whether they actively forgive past punishers or simply follow a complex internal ledger that sometimes results in positive and sometimes in negative actions toward the same counterpart. Confidence in attributing a stable forgiving or unforgiving stance is low; the safest description is that they are not punishment-averse and do not visibly “back down” in response to being sanctioned.\n\n<REWARD>\nThis player is also a frequent and substantial user of reward, although less single-mindedly than punishment. They spend notable amounts to reward others across many rounds. Their rewards are directed both to high contributors and to some low contributors, and sometimes to players who are themselves frequent punishers or rewarders. This shows that their rewards are not purely based on current-round contribution levels.\n\nThe pattern suggests multiple motives:\n\n- **Positive reinforcement of perceived allies or behaviors:** They often reward players who appear cooperative or who may have treated them well (e.g., by rewarding them or refraining from punishing them). This points to conditional kindness: they use rewards to encourage or maintain alliances and to reinforce behaviors they like.\n\n- **Balancing and signaling:** They sometimes reward players who are simultaneously being heavily punished by others, and they occasionally reward players they themselves have punished in other rounds. This indicates that they use reward to fine-tune their stance toward individuals, signaling nuance (“I disapprove of some things, but I still credit you for others”) rather than treating punishment and reward as mutually exclusive.\n\n- **Low efficiency concern:** Given that here reward has much weaker leverage than punishment, a payoff-maximizer would use punishment for deterrence and rarely reward. This player nevertheless invests substantially in rewards, suggesting that they are motivated by expressive or relational concerns (gratitude, alliance-building, or fairness adjustments) more than by strict cost-benefit efficiency.\n\nOverall, their reward behavior is generous but strategic: they seem to maintain a mental map of who is “on their side” or promoting the kind of group they prefer and use rewards to support those players, even when the mechanism is relatively weak.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nWhen rewarded, this player does not exhibit a simple, consistent reciprocity rule, but there are hints of gratitude or alliance-building. They often reward players who themselves are active in the reward system, and they include frequent rewarders among their positive targets in later decisions. However, the evidence is not strong enough to claim a strict “I reward those who reward me” strategy; many of their reward and punishment choices do not map cleanly onto who has helped or hurt them most recently.\n\nThey do not clearly shift their contribution behavior upward in response to being rewarded, nor do they consistently protect rewarders from future punishment. This suggests that, while they may feel and express some gratitude, their internal ledger blends many factors (contribution history, punishment history, others’ treatment by the group) rather than simple direct reciprocity. Their response to being rewarded is therefore best described as partially reciprocal and relational, but noisy: they are open to alliances, yet they do not subordinate their broader norm-enforcement agenda to any one relationship.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThis player appears highly attentive to others’ contributions, payoffs, and sanctioning patterns. They adjust their punishment and reward targets in ways that reflect an active reading of who is currently being hurt, who is benefiting, and who is spending on sanctions. They sometimes support players who are otherwise being heavily punished by others, and they sometimes pile additional punishment onto players already under group pressure. This indicates that they track not only raw contributions but also social standing and recent treatment.\n\nThey often reward players whose outcomes suggest cooperation or costly generosity and punish those whose outcomes suggest repeated free-riding or aggressive sanctioning. However, because they sometimes sanction cooperators and reward low contributors, they are evidently using a more complex evaluation than “cooperation good, defection bad.” They may weigh perceived fairness across multiple rounds, viewing certain highly successful players as deserving of correction if their success is seen as coming at the group’s expense or through overuse of punishment.\n\nOverall, their reaction to others’ outcomes is that of an active, opinionated social accountant: they use the detailed feedback on contributions, sanctions, and payoffs to maintain a mental reputation system and to continually adjust who they punish or reward. They accept substantial personal cost to act on these judgments, prioritizing the expression and enforcement of their idiosyncratic norms over maximizing their own monetary outcome."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a high, near-unconditional cooperator. They almost always contribute the full endowment despite many free riders being present and despite frequent personal punishment. Defection is extremely rare and appears only in two isolated rounds, not as part of a trend. Their cooperation is only weakly conditional on others’ behavior: they continue to contribute when low contributors and zero contributors persist in the group, and when they themselves are targeted. They seem to follow a strong norm that “one should cooperate with the group” even when it is not payoff-maximizing. They tolerate substantial exploitation and do not attempt to protect themselves by systematically reducing contributions when others free ride. This pattern suggests a fairness or efficiency norm that prioritizes the public good over short-run personal gain, combined with high risk tolerance regarding being the “sucker” who contributes when others do not. They do not appear to be experimenting with contributions; their behavior is stable and rule-like rather than exploratory.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThe player remains cooperative through the final round. There is no clear contribution decay as the horizon approaches; instead, they continue to provide full contributions even when many others visibly defect late in the game and when they receive strong end-game punishment for defecting once. Their rare defections do not cluster strictly at the end; the last round returns to full cooperation. On the sanctioning side, they continue to use punishment and reward mechanisms late into the game, including targeted punishment in the final round, indicating they remain engaged in norm enforcement rather than “cashing out” or ceasing to invest in costly social control. This suggests they either discount the end-game structure or deliberately ignore backward-induction logic in favor of maintaining norms until the very end.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThe player is a frequent and targeted punisher. They consistently punish a persistent low contributor (PINGUIN) across many rounds, even when that player is heavily punished by others, indicating a strong anti-free-rider stance rather than a one-off reaction. They also punish another low-contributing player (CROCODILE) on selected occasions, particularly when that player combines low contributions with complex punishment/reward behavior toward others. Their punishment of high free riders is more systematic than their punishment of medium contributors; they do not punish cooperators, and they almost never punish ambiguous or borderline cases. This selectivity points to norm-enforcement and deterrence motives: they target those who repeatedly contribute nothing while benefiting from the group. They are willing to absorb sizable personal costs to continue this punishment stream, showing low sensitivity to the personal cost effectiveness of punishment and high commitment to enforcing a cooperative standard. In one notable exception, they punish a previously cooperative player (SLOTH) in the final round after that player has been zero-contributing intermittently and also engaging in heavy sanctioning. This end-game punishment appears consistent with punishing defectors rather than random retaliation: they do not appear to use punishment against those who punished them, and there is no clear pattern of counter-punishment toward their own punishers. Overall, they use punishment as a consistent, morally driven tool against chronic free riders, not as an emotional response to being targeted.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nThey are repeatedly punished by several others, including for both cooperative and defective rounds, and sometimes quite harshly. Their behavioral response is strikingly non-retaliatory: they never clearly punish someone simply because that party punished them earlier, and they do not switch to targeting those who sanction them. Instead, they keep punishing the same norm-violating free riders and keep cooperating in contributions. There is no strong evidence that punishment toward them causes sustained contribution reductions; they defect once after having been a persistent cooperator, are heavily punished, and then return to high contributions. When they are punished in rounds where they cooperate, they neither respond with counter-punishment nor with social withdrawal (e.g., serial defection). This indicates high forgiveness or at least a strong separation in their mind between “who punished me” and “who is violating the contribution norm.” They appear to interpret punishment directed at themselves as part of the general noisy sanctioning environment rather than as a signal to change targets or form vendettas. Compliance-wise, they do not clearly adjust their target selection in favor of their punishers or away from them; they stay focused on chronic low contributors.\n\n<REWARD>\nThe player is a regular and selective rewarder, but much less intense in rewarding than in punishing. They spend on rewards for clear high contributors and for especially prosocial players, often reinforcing those who repeatedly contribute fully and sometimes also engage in prosocial sanctioning. Reward targets include consistently cooperative players and those who have rewarded or supported cooperation in others, indicating a mix of gratitude and reinforcement motives. They almost never reward low contributors, and when a previous free rider begins contributing or stops misbehaving, the player sometimes withholds further punishment but does not immediately move into rewarding them; their rewards are more clearly tied to ongoing, visible cooperation than to one-off improvements. They accept the poor cost-effectiveness of the reward technology and still use it, suggesting a preference for norm reinforcement and positive signaling over simple earnings maximization. Over time, they refine reward targets somewhat, tending to reward a small subset of the most dependable cooperators rather than distributing rewards widely.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThey receive rewards in various rounds from multiple others, yet their reward behavior does not obviously track who has previously rewarded them. They do not build explicit bilateral “alliances” of mutual rewarding; instead, they reward based on perceived overall contribution and cooperativeness. There is no clear tit-for-tat reciprocation of reward to any specific individual that can be tied to a prior incoming reward from that same individual. This suggests that gratitude, while possibly present, is filtered through their underlying norm-based criteria: they appear to value sustained cooperative conduct more than personal kindness toward themselves. Being rewarded does not shift their punishment targets away from free riders nor does it induce them to preferentially protect or defend their rewarders; their sanctioning decisions remain focused on contribution behavior. Overall, their response to being rewarded is to maintain their cooperative and norm-enforcing strategy rather than to shift into alliance-based reciprocity.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey pay close attention to who is contributing and who is not, and they appear to track how others use the punishment and reward mechanisms. Their persistent focus on the same chronic free rider shows that they extrapolate from repeated low contributions to a stable “type” and act accordingly. They seem unperturbed by others’ high payoffs when those payoffs come from cooperation; they even reinforce such players with rewards. Conversely, when free riders maintain relatively high payoffs despite frequent punishment, the player continues to sanction them rather than disengaging, suggesting they are monitoring outcomes and concluding that more enforcement is warranted. They do not appear jealous of high-earning cooperators; instead, they treat them as partners in maintaining a cooperative environment. When observing complex sanctioning by others (for example, other players heavily punishing multiple targets), they do not automatically join those sanctioning campaigns; their response remains anchored in observed contribution patterns rather than in how much someone is spending on punishment or reward. In late game, when others escalate punishment intensity and some players incur severe losses through sanctioning, this player does not mirror that escalation; they keep costs moderate and targets stable. This restraint supports a personality profile of a principled norm enforcer who is attentive to patterns in others’ behavior but resists being drawn into cycles of escalating hostility."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a high-earning conditional cooperator who alternates between free-riding and full contribution in a patterned way. They consistently choose either all or nothing, never intermediate amounts (by design), and over the game they contribute full endowment in most rounds but intersperse sequences of zero contributions. Their cooperation is clearly conditional on others’ behavior: they are much more likely to contribute when the group’s overall contribution level is high and relatively uniform, and they free-ride when several identifiable players give little or nothing, or when defectors are not being effectively disciplined by others. They appear willing to sacrifice immediate private payoff to sustain a relatively cooperative norm when contributions from others look strong and somewhat stable, but they are not a pure altruist: when they see substantial non-contribution with little consequence, they revert to self-interested free-riding. The switching between contribution and free-riding is not random; it tracks shifts in the pattern of group cooperation and (especially) the behavior of a few persistent low contributors. They show no obvious escalating contribution in response to punishment or reward; their own payoffs remain comparatively high throughout, suggesting they are attentive to efficiency but also comfortable exploiting cooperative environments when they judge the norm to be weakly enforced.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nAwareness of the horizon does not lead to a straightforward “end-game collapse” for this player. In the final quarter of the game, they continue to contribute full endowment in most rounds, punctuated by a small number of zero-contribution choices that are consistent with their earlier conditional pattern rather than a simple end-round defection. They even spend on costly punishment very near the end, which is inconsistent with a purely myopic last-round payoff focus. At the same time, their late-game punishments are relatively intense and targeted at repeat low contributors, indicating that they may see the end-game as a final opportunity to sanction norm violators rather than a time to quietly defect. Overall, horizon effects are present but subtle: they do not stop cooperating, and instead use sanctions more aggressively when the game is almost over. Their belief seems to be that enforcing fairness or “settling scores” is still worth the cost, even when future interaction is minimal.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThe player is a selective but sometimes harsh norm enforcer. They do not habitually punish: most rounds they refrain entirely, but when they do punish, they target clear, repeated low contributors rather than random peers. Their pattern shows that non-contributors or chronic under-contributors are the primary triggers; they almost never punish high contributors or those aligned with the cooperative norm. When they do act, they often use only minimal units early (a single unit directed at one player) and escalate to punishing multiple low contributors in the same round later in the game. They never use punishment to retaliate against someone who merely punished them personally; instead, their sanctions align with contribution behavior, not with who targeted them. This strongly suggests a norm-enforcing motive (second-order punishment) rather than spite or interpersonal retaliation. They do not use punishment tactically to improve their own immediate payoff—indeed, some of their multi-target sanctions are clearly costly in net terms—indicating a willingness to incur real personal cost to discipline free-riding and to express disapproval of unfair exploitation.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nThe player is repeatedly punished in earlier and middle phases, often by others who appear to be sanctioning their own defections. After being punished in this way, the player does sometimes shift from free-riding to contributing in subsequent rounds, but this shift is not consistently immediate, nor is it always directly tied to a specific punisher; it coincides with changes in overall group cooperation and punishment patterns more broadly. They do not directly retaliate against the specific individuals who punish them; there is no clear case of them targeting a known punisher simply because that agent sanctioned them. Instead, their later punishment is directed at players who are themselves low contributors. This indicates that they interpret punishment as a signal about cooperative norms rather than as an interpersonal attack. They show a form of compliance at the group-norm level (moving toward more frequent contributions when free-riding is visibly punished), combined with a forgiving, non-retaliatory stance toward specific punishers. They do not form vendettas but update behavior based on the overall environment of sanctions and contributions.\n\n<REWARD>\nThe player never spends on rewards at any point, despite frequently earning high payoffs that would allow them to afford positive transfers. This holds even in periods where group cooperation is very strong and others are engaging in reciprocal or prosocial rewarding. Their lack of rewarding is stable and unambiguous. This suggests that they either regard the reward technology as inefficient (cost equals benefit, whereas punishment has a high leverage) or that their social preference is asymmetrically focused on deterring defection rather than reinforcing cooperation. Put differently, they are willing to pay to harm defectors but not to help cooperators, even when those cooperators are the ones enabling their own high payoffs. This absence of rewarding also indicates that they are not especially interested in building bilateral alliances or signaling gratitude via positive transfers; instead, they rely on contribution choices and occasional punishment as their main social instruments.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThe player receives rewards on several occasions, including at times when they themselves have free-rode and at times when they have contributed fully, but they never reciprocate with rewards. They also show no clear pattern of preferentially benefiting those who rewarded them, either through subsequent contributions or through leniency in punishment; their behavior toward rewarders versus non-rewarders appears similar and driven primarily by each target’s contribution level, not past generosity toward the player. This strongly suggests that they treat incoming rewards mainly as opportunistic windfalls rather than as relationship-building signals. They do not respond with visible gratitude, alliance building, or symmetric transfers. In terms of type, this marks them as low in reciprocal altruism via rewards: their cooperation and punishment decisions are shaped by others’ adherence to contribution norms, not by who has personally treated them kindly.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThe player pays close attention to the structure of others’ payoffs, especially how much different players contribute and how much they are punished or rewarded. Their shifts between cooperation and free-riding track not only group average contributions but also whether chronic defectors are being heavily sanctioned. When they see certain low-contributing players repeatedly avoid strong punishment while enjoying high redistributed payoffs, they are more likely to free-ride themselves or eventually step in as a punisher. Conversely, when most others contribute and sanction defectors, the player is more willing to contribute consistently. Their own punishment choices later in the game show that they incorporate observed histories: they often target players who have shown repeated low contributions over many rounds, indicating memory and pattern recognition rather than short-horizon reactions. They do not appear to respond much to others’ use of rewards; extensive rewarding by some players does not cause them to start rewarding or to differentially treat these prosocial types. Overall, they interpret others’ outcomes primarily as information about fairness and enforcement of norms, and adjust their own contributions and sanctions to align with what they see as justifiable treatment of cooperators vs. free-riders.\n\nType summary (implicit across sections): This player is a norm-focused conditional cooperator and occasional opportunist: they prefer high, stable cooperation backed by strong punishment of defectors, are willing to contribute fully under such norms, are ready to free-ride when they see unchecked defection, and are willing to bear significant personal cost to sanction repeated free-riders, while remaining indifferent to positive-reciprocity via rewards."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a highly stable, near-unconditional full cooperator. They almost always contribute the maximum allowed amount to the public fund and maintain that pattern throughout the game, with a single clear deviation when they contribute nothing. That deviation does not lead to any lasting shift in behavior: they immediately return to full contributions and keep doing so consistently.\n\nTheir cooperation does not appear tightly conditional on others’ exact behavior. They continue to put in the maximum even when a few others occasionally free‑ride or when others are experimenting with punishment and reward schemes. They align quickly with an emerging “everyone maxes” group norm and never attempt to exploit the group after that norm is established.\n\nThey explicitly endorse the cooperative norm in chat, agreeing with the group strategy of maximizing contributions and emphasizing speed and simplicity. When considering alternatives (like mutual rewarding), they focus on process costs (extra clicking, slowing the game) rather than on trying to extract extra private benefit by deviating. This suggests a preference for straightforward, low‑cognitive‑effort cooperation over more intricate, strategically complex schemes.\n\nRisk tolerance with respect to being the “sucker” is relatively high: they keep contributing fully even after seeing that free riders can be punished but also that some players occasionally get away with lower contributions or opportunistic reward use. They appear more interested in maintaining a smooth, coordinated equilibrium than in hedging against possible exploitation.\n\nOverall, they fit a “principled, efficiency‑minded cooperator” type: they adopt the cooperative scheme early and then stick to it with very low volatility, only rarely deviating and not using those deviations to pivot into self‑serving strategies.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nTheir tone is friendly, brief, and cooperative. They participate in greetings at the start and later contribute a small number of comments that affirm the group’s cooperative strategy and prioritize smooth play. They neither lead the group nor remain silently detached; instead, they selectively speak when they can reinforce consensus or clarify their own stance.\n\nThey do not attempt to persuade others through moralizing or threats. When a more complex reward scheme is discussed, they calmly state a practical objection: it would be cumbersome and slow the game. This frames their decision as effort‑ and time‑based rather than distrust‑based, signaling they are cooperative but prefer simple coordination rules.\n\nThey express positive affect toward the group at the end, explicitly complimenting the group. This aligns with a socially warm, group‑oriented style without being chat‑dominant. They engage when relevant but avoid side conversations, jokes, or meta‑analysis of the experiment beyond minimal agreement with others’ points.\n\nOverall, they are a low‑volume, pro‑norm communicator: they speak to affirm cooperative norms, emphasize convenience and speed, and close with appreciation, without trying to control others’ behavior.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey never punish anyone, despite multiple opportunities and clear social support in the group for sanctioning free riders and disruptive behavior. This holds even when others punish obvious defectors and when defectors’ behavior is costly to the group.\n\nThis pattern suggests a strong aversion to using negative sanctions. The absence of any “test” punishment, even once, indicates they are not experimenting with deterrence or retaliation. They appear to rely on others to enforce norms or simply to let the cooperative equilibrium sustain itself.\n\nBecause they never punish, it is difficult to disentangle whether this stems from a principled dislike of harming others, a belief that punishment is inefficient or unnecessary in this already cooperative group, or simple inertia/effort avoidance. There is no explicit statement from them about punishment, so the motivation is unknown, but behaviorally they function as a non‑punishing cooperator who free‑rides on any enforcement others provide.\n\nThey are therefore best characterized as a “non‑sanctioning” type: even in a context where punishment is cheap and socially validated, they abstain completely.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nThey are punished exactly once and rewarded heavily in that same decision stage. They do not respond in chat to having been punished, make no complaint, and show no sign of anger or retaliation. In subsequent moves, they immediately resume full contributions and do not begin punishing others.\n\nThis suggests a forgiving or at least non‑reactive stance toward sanctions against them. They do not appear to interpret punishment as hostile enough to warrant counter‑punishment, nor does it make them withdraw cooperation. Instead, they stay aligned with the cooperative norm.\n\nThey also do not overtly adapt their future strategy in a way that acknowledges punishment (no explicit “I’ll behave” messaging), perhaps because they were already generally cooperative and the zero‑contribution episode looks more like a one‑off deviation than a deliberate defection pattern.\n\nIn summary, their response to being punished is compliance in behavior (maintained full contributions), no visible resentment, and no attempt to sanction the punisher or contest the legitimacy of the punishment.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey never reward anyone, despite many rounds where everyone cooperates and there are obvious candidates for positive reinforcement. Even when another player points out that the reward technology is privately profitable if everyone uses it, they still abstain.\n\nWhen mutual rewarding is discussed, they give a candid explanation: interacting with the extra buttons would “take forever” and slow the game down. They explicitly endorse ignoring the mechanism and just continuing with the simple “max contribution” strategy. This is a rare explicit statement of their underlying preference: minimizing extra interaction cost and game duration is more important to them than extracting an additional coin via coordinated rewards.\n\nThey therefore appear not to be anti‑reward in principle, but anti‑complexity and anti‑friction. In practice, this makes them a non‑rewarder, even in a setting where reward is available, profitable in expectation under full coordination, and socially encouraged by some players.\n\nFunctionally, they are a “minimal‑effort cooperator” with respect to incentive mechanisms: they provide their full contribution to the public good but do not invest further coins or time into formal reward structures.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThey receive a substantial amount of reward in the same stage where they are also punished once. They do not acknowledge these rewards explicitly in chat and do not change their own reward behavior afterward—they continue not to reward others.\n\nThere is no evidence of direct reciprocity toward any rewarder, nor of alliance‑building based on who rewarded them. They do not start engaging more with those players in chat or reward them back. Instead, they maintain the same simple behavioral rule: contribute fully, skip the reward/punishment stage.\n\nThis suggests that being rewarded does not materially alter their strategy or social orientation. They appear to treat reward as a pleasant but non‑decisive windfall, not as a cue to start engaging in reciprocal exchanges.\n\nOverall, their response to reward is neutral‑compliant: they accept it behaviorally (higher payoff), show no visible gratitude or shift in strategy, and continue following their pre‑existing simple cooperation rule set.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey observe a wide range of others’ outcomes, including heavy punishment of free riders, costly reward experiments, and later, fine‑tuned sanctions targeting a specific unreliable cooperator. They almost never comment directly on specific payoff patterns or target choices.\n\nTheir single explicit response related to mechanisms is to the proposal of a mutual reward scheme: they frame their rejection in terms of effort and time rather than fairness or trust. They do not publicly pressure defectors, applaud punishers, or criticize those using the mechanisms in idiosyncratic ways. Instead, they quietly stick with max contributions and endorse the simple cooperative “just max out” approach in line with others’ comments.\n\nThey also do not exploit knowledge of others’ outcomes to improve their private payoff beyond the one occasion of contributing nothing (which could be exploratory, convenience‑driven, or simply opportunistic; motivation is unknown). After that, they ignore the possibility of targeted free‑riding or strategic reward/punishment based on observed histories.\n\nIn sum, they monitor the environment enough to agree with the group’s high‑cooperation equilibrium and to understand that extra mechanisms exist, but they choose not to respond to individual outcomes with tailored strategic behavior. Their dominant reaction to others’ outcomes is to maintain stable, simple cooperation and favor fast, low‑effort play."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a predominantly unconditional high contributor with occasional, deliberate deviations. Their default is to give the maximum possible amount and they sustain this pattern through essentially the entire game, despite observing repeated under-contribution by at least one peer. This indicates a strong prosocial or efficiency-oriented motive that is not easily undermined by free-riding.\n\nTheir contribution pattern is highly stable and predictable: maximum giving is the norm, while reductions are rare, discrete events rather than the start of a downward trend. These few low-contribution choices appear exploratory or retaliatory tests rather than a full strategy shift. Across the game, they repeatedly return to the maximum-contribution baseline immediately after such deviations, suggesting that high cooperation is their reference point.\n\nThey exhibit some conditionality: they do occasionally free-ride or partially free-ride when others’ contributions drop or when the group has recently shown reliability. However, these episodes are sparse and short-lived. The player seems to be checking (a) how much personal gain is possible from defecting and (b) whether the group’s cooperation will collapse in response. Once they confirm that others remain largely cooperative, they revert to full contributions. This indicates that they value both payoff and group efficiency but prioritize sustaining cooperation over systematically exploiting it.\n\nNormatively, they appear to hold a strong fairness and efficiency norm that “everyone should give fully.” Their behavior is consistent with someone who treats full contribution as the socially appropriate baseline and tolerates some deviation by others without abandoning that norm. When they do deviate, they do not push the system toward full collapse; instead, they test the margin and quickly re-align with the high-contribution convention. This suggests they see themselves as a cooperator first, not as an opportunistic free-rider.\n\nRisk tolerance is moderately high in a social sense. Continuing to fully contribute even when a free-rider or partial free-rider is present exposes them to exploitation in the short run. They still take that risk, implying trust in the group’s overall cooperative orientation and/or a focus on maximizing total group returns rather than strictly securing their own relative advantage. At the same time, their rare defection episodes show they are not naive: they are aware of the payoff structure and are willing to temporarily prioritize self-gain, especially when they anticipate that group cooperation is robust enough to survive it.\n\nIn summary, this player is best characterized as a “principled high contributor with opportunistic tests”: they default to full cooperation, strongly support a high-contribution norm, occasionally probe the limits of that norm through brief free-riding or partial contributions, then reliably return to maximal giving once the test is complete."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a “near-max unconditional cooperator with mild, opaque self-interest.” They consistently contribute very high amounts, typically just below or at the maximum, and do so across early, middle, and late parts of the game. Their behavior shows a strong tendency toward cooperation that does not collapse even when others occasionally drop their contributions or openly discuss defecting.\n\nThey often choose the maximum possible contribution or just one or two coins shy of it. These small, recurring shortfalls are not clearly tied to any visible pattern in others’ behavior; they appear either idiosyncratic, due to uncertainty about the interface, or reflect a subtle tendency to keep a tiny private margin. There is no clear evidence that they adjust their contribution in a systematic “conditional cooperation” way (e.g., matching others’ exact average or clearly punishing low contributors). Instead, they keep contributing at a high level even when some group members repeatedly contribute very little or explicitly talk about contributing zero.\n\nTheir contributions remain relatively stable and high in the face of:\n- Explicit group norms in favor of full cooperation.\n- Frustration and mild coordination breakdowns when some players free-ride or “troll.”\n- Occasional calls for retaliation or collective defection.\n\nThey do not visibly join any “everyone contribute zero” movement. When some others experiment with zero or low contributions, this player continues to contribute near-max. This suggests they place more weight on maintaining high payoffs from the multiplier (and perhaps on upholding a cooperative norm) than on using their contribution as a punishment signal.\n\nThey show no apparent risk-seeking experimentation with low contributions. Instead, they repeatedly choose what is, in this environment, individually and collectively payoff-maximizing given the high multiplier: putting (almost) everything into the public fund. Their minor, repeated undercontributions (e.g., 19 instead of 20) indicate a small, persistent deviation from full altruism, but not enough to change their type away from being predominantly cooperative.\n\nThey appear to accept inequality in payoffs caused by others’ free-riding rather than sacrificing their own expected earnings to discipline defectors. This combination—high but not perfectly maximal giving, low volatility, and weak conditionality—fits a “quasi-unconditional cooperator who tolerates exploitation and sticks to a simple high-contribution heuristic.”\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThe player never speaks in the chat, so all aspects of their communication style are unknown. They do not initiate coordination, persuasion, or norm-setting via messages, nor do they visibly respond in text to others’ encouragement, complaints, or strategic suggestions. Any responsiveness they show is expressed only through their contribution choices, not through verbal interaction.\n\nTone, social warmth, directness, and conflict style are all unknown. It is unclear whether their silence reflects deliberate disengagement from social exchange, confusion about the interface, preference for focusing on payoffs rather than discussion, or external constraints (e.g., not noticing the chat). Their beliefs about others’ intentions and reliability must therefore be inferred solely from their stable, high-cooperation behavior, not from explicit statements."

After an initial mid-level contribution, they quickly shift to full contributions and then consistently give the maximum feasible amount every subsequent round, including when others temporarily deviate downward or explicitly propose lowering contributions. They do not visibly condition their behavior on recent group averages, on the presence of a persistent low contributor, or on coordinated calls to defect. Even when coordination chatter briefly turns toward contributing nothing, they explicitly state they are contributing the maximum and follow through.\n\nThey appear to understand that, given the multiplier and group size, contributing fully is individually profitable regardless of others’ actions. Their comments indicate they recognize that even with some low contributors, contributing fully still leaves them better off. This reflects a payoff-maximizing but cooperation-compatible strategy rather than pure altruism: they are not obviously sacrificing payoff for principle; instead, high cooperation and self-interest are aligned in their reasoning. They tolerate free-riding and noise without retaliatory defection, suggesting low propensity for conditional cooperation and low use of reciprocity as a strategy.\n\nThey do not experiment with contribution levels, showing minimal volatility and little learning-by-trying. Their behavior is best described as “rational steadfast cooperator”: once they infer that maxing out is individually and collectively optimal, they lock into that strategy and maintain it to the end, regardless of frustration with specific others.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nTheir communication is sparse but clear and aligned with high cooperation. Early on they briefly greet the group, then later explicitly endorse the collective-max strategy and confirm their own intention to fully contribute. They rely on short, decisive statements rather than detailed explanation, suggesting confidence in their understanding but not a strong urge to teach or lead.\n\nThey show awareness of the social tension around a repeatedly low-contributing participant and join in mild, indirect disparagement, referring to them in a negative but somewhat joking tone. They frame that person as a “plonker” and express a wish that this disruptive presence might disappear, indicating annoyance with exploitative or uncooperative behavior. However, they do not use this frustration as a basis to change their own contributions; their irritation is verbal only.\n\nThey do not actively guide confused players through the mechanics and leave the detailed instruction to others, even though they share the same cooperative goal. Their persuasion style is minimal: they affirm willingness to cooperate and occasionally reassure others that maximal cooperation remains beneficial despite free-riders, but they do not engage in back-and-forth debates or elaborate coordination schemes. Overall, they engage selectively, support the cooperative norm, display some sarcasm toward defectors, but remain focused on their own consistent cooperative strategy rather than on social engineering."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a mostly unconditional high contributor with a brief early defection and one isolated low-contribution outlier. They start by contributing well below the emerging group norm, taking advantage of others’ generosity while the environment is still being figured out. Immediately afterward, once a strong group norm of full contribution forms and is reinforced in chat, they switch to consistently contributing the maximum. This pattern holds almost the entire game, including after observing some others occasionally withholding or experimenting with zero. \n\nThe single very low contribution appears once, midgame, during a period when frustration and joking about free-riding are visible in chat. The player does not persist with this behavior; they quickly revert to full contributions thereafter. This suggests a momentary deviation (possibly opportunistic or experimental) rather than a stable strategy of exploitation or retaliation.\n\nOverall, they behave like a “norm-following high cooperator”: willing to cooperate fully as long as there is a visible cooperative majority, and not strongly conditional on the exact fairness of each other individual’s behavior. They do not systematically punish low contributors via their own contributions, even when given obvious opportunities to do so. They appear comfortable sustaining high cooperation even in the presence of a conspicuous freerider, treating that as noise rather than as a reason to unravel the public good.\n\nTheir contributions also indicate relatively low risk aversion with respect to group cooperation: they continue to invest fully even when a few others coordinate to temporarily defect and even near the end of the game, despite not knowing when the task will stop. They seem to prioritize the expected gain from the group multiplier over short-term private gains from holding back, and they do not try to time an “endgame collapse.”\n\nIn environments without punishment or reward options, this player’s default is to keep contributing at or near the maximum once a cooperative equilibrium is established. They show little inclination to lead a defection or to closely fine-tune contributions as a function of minor norm violations. If placed in a group that is mostly cooperative, they almost certainly continue to be a near-maximum contributor; if placed in a mostly non-cooperative group, their behavior is less clear (unknown), as there is no evidence of them facing a sustained low-cooperation environment.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThe player does not speak in the chat at any point. They are a completely silent participant, despite very active communication from others and multiple invitations to coordinate. This indicates an engagement style that is observant but non-verbal: they read and respond behaviorally to the group’s stated norms but choose not to participate in the social discourse.\n\nTheir non-participation means they neither cajole nor criticize others, avoid joking or moralizing, and do not publicly align with any faction (those supportive of the struggling player vs. those hostile, or the cooperators vs. would-be defectors). They let others handle norm enforcement and persuasion, and simply react at the decision screen.\n\nThis silence suggests a preference for low social visibility, low conflict, and perhaps a focus on the task’s payoff structure over social dynamics. Nevertheless, their actions track the cooperative narrative being developed in chat: once the group converges on “we should all put in the maximum,” they align their contributions accordingly and maintain that line, even when some others later try to organize a collective move to zero. They do not publicly resist these calls; they simply ignore them in their choices.\n\nIn new PGG environments, this player is best characterized as a quiet, behaviorally cooperative type: they listen, infer the prevailing cooperative standard from others’ contributions and messages, but refrain from active persuasion, leadership, or confrontation. Their influence on the group is purely via their consistent high contributions, not via communication."

They do not condition their own contributions on others’ behavior in any systematic way; there is no evidence of retaliation, strategic withholding, or “teaching” via contribution changes. Instead, they appear to treat their own contribution level as a fixed norm once they infer that full contribution is payoff-maximizing for the group.\n\nTheir comments show that they understand the structure of the game and believe that full contribution is individually rational when others also contribute, and they endorse the idea that non-contributors are being “stingy.” They show willingness to tolerate exploitation by a persistent low contributor rather than sacrifice their own cooperative standard. Even when a small coalition proposes mutual defection to punish the free-rider, they do not join and instead continue to give the maximum. This suggests low willingness to use contribution as a punitive or strategic lever and a relatively low appetite for payoff-destroying punishment even in the face of frustration. Risk tolerance appears moderate to high at the social level: they consistently “bet” on cooperation and maintain that bet even after evidence of opportunism. Their fairness norms emphasize what others “should” do (everyone contributing fully) more than matching others’ behavior; they express disapproval verbally but do not translate that into behavioral defection. Overall, they fit a “principled high cooperator” profile rather than a conditional cooperator.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThis player is socially engaged, responsive, and uses a light, somewhat humorous tone mixed with mild moral judgment. They greet others, answer coordination questions, and occasionally affirm or agree with others’ statements. They clearly understand the cooperative logic of the game and explicitly endorse it, briefly encouraging full contributions and criticizing under-contributors as “stingy” or trolling. Their style mixes joking with mild exasperation: they make wry comments about others’ math skills and speculate that a problematic player may be a researcher plant or troll, but these remarks remain relatively light and not overtly hostile.\n\nThey participate in group-level norm-setting but are not a primary organizer of detailed coordination plans; they chime in to support full-contribution norms rather than propose complex strategies. When the group’s mood shifts from anger toward the problematic player to more playful or resigned banter, they adapt by using humor themselves. They also occasionally offer short supportive or approving messages when someone appears to cooperate in line with the group’s preference, suggesting a tendency to reinforce prosocial behavior socially rather than through contribution changes.\n\nThey do not appear to dominate the conversation; instead they interject periodically, react to others’ comments, and contribute to the shared narrative about who is cooperative and who might be trolling. Their responses to persistent norm violations are verbal (sarcastic comments, sighs, expressions of disbelief) rather than escalatory or coordinated sanction attempts. Overall, they are an engaged, cooperative communicator who uses brief, emotionally expressive remarks to signal norms, express mild frustration, and maintain group cohesion without pushing hard or taking a leadership role."

This suggests they prioritize payoff-maximization under the given mechanism, not just altruism. They appear risk-accepting in the sense that they do not hedge against the possibility that others will defect; instead, they rely on the multiplier logic and trust that enough others will contribute for full contribution to remain best for them.\n\nThey exhibit no detectable conditional cooperation: their behavior does not change when average group contribution falls, when prominent others announce lower contributions, or when there is explicit talk of “everyone do 0.” They keep playing the dominant “max” strategy even when it temporarily yields them visibly lower returns.

They do not show any sign of using subtle conditional cooperation rules (e.g., tit-for-tat or gradual adjustments): despite persistent under-contribution by at least one other player and some low contributions by others, they almost always continue to give the maximum rather than punishing defectors by reducing their own input.\n\nTheir one clear deviation to zero contribution appears driven by group-level coordination rather than opportunistic free-riding: they explicitly ask whether the new norm is to contribute nothing and follow that suggestion for that round, then immediately reaffirm a desire to return to maximal contributions afterward. This suggests a willingness to conform to an apparent group consensus experiment, rather than a personal shift toward selfishness.\n\nThey exhibit a strong fairness and efficiency norm oriented around “if we all cooperate, we all do better,” but they tolerate inequality in practice: they remain a high contributor even when others benefit while contributing less. There is no evidence of risk aversion in the sense of protecting themselves from exploitation by lowering contributions; instead, they are willing to risk being the “sucker” as long as overall returns remain high.

Their explanations focus on intuitive benefits (“more in, more out”) rather than technical detail, suggesting they aim to make the game feel accessible and cooperative rather than analytical or confrontational.\n\nThey engage directly with others’ messages, referencing what others say and adjusting their own comments to the ongoing social dynamic.

They avoid sarcasm or direct blame, even when others are cynical or hostile, and they maintain a steady, prosocial engagement throughout.\n\nOverall, they communicate as a cooperative coordinator and emotional buffer: a player who tries to keep the group focused on mutual benefit, maintain a positive atmosphere, reduce interpersonal tension, and encourage consistent high contributions through optimism and reassurance rather than pressure or threat."

Their behavior suggests they prioritize maximizing group returns over short-term individual gain, even in the presence of a clearly identified low contributor. They show only one notable conflict between stated intentions and later regret: they verbally align with a temporary suggestion to reduce contributions but still actually contribute the maximum, then acknowledge that outcome with mild self-directed frustration. This indicates an intention to experiment with conditional cooperation but a default habit or preference for full contribution.\n\nThey operate with a clear understanding that higher group contributions strictly increase individual payoffs under the multiplier; they explicitly articulate that low contributors can exploit the group by “putting in less and getting more out” while still benefiting from others’ generosity. Despite this awareness, they continue to play in a prosocial, high-contribution way rather than shifting to self-protection.\n\nTheir norm seems to be “everyone should give the maximum every time,” and they treat deviations as norm violations rather than just neutral strategic differences. They support the idea of coordinated full contributions and repeatedly announce their intention to give the maximum, both as commitment and as a way to induce others to follow. They show moderate risk tolerance: they are willing to risk being exploited by one or two low contributors if the rest of the group cooperates, and they do not meaningfully hedge against that exploitation by lowering their own contributions.

They try to use light teasing and shared jokes to create in-group pressure on the identified low contributor; their language toward that player oscillates between playful name-calling and more direct attributions of greed or bad faith. When another player proposes that the low contributor might simply be confused, they momentarily adopt a more charitable interpretation and even help explain the interface and strategy, showing some flexibility and willingness to instruct rather than only blame.\n\nThey are responsive to others’ messages: they answer questions about how to play (emphasizing that simply finalizing with all coins in the pot is optimal), respond to speculation about bots or researchers, correct or confirm information about round counts and bonus structure, and riff on others’ jokes about “plants,” “trolls,” and bots. Their engagement style is affiliative and group-oriented; they clearly identify with the main cooperative coalition and use language that reinforces group cohesion against the low contributor as an outsider.\n\nThey also show some strategic persuasion attempts: they publicly call out the free-rider’s behavior as greedy and explain that this player is earning extra by not contributing, presumably to motivate either social sanctions (in the form of lowered contributions from others) or a change in that player’s behavior. However, when a mini-coalition briefly considers switching to zero contributions as a retaliatory move, this player verbally aligns but does not follow through behaviorally. This mismatch suggests that in new environments they are more likely to talk about contingent strategies than to actually implement them if doing so conflicts with their ingrained cooperative norm.\n\nOverall, they are a cooperative, norm-enforcing communicator: they prefer high contributions from everyone, use conversation to coordinate and instruct, and rely on humor and light social pressure more than on withdrawal or retaliation."

Their default is to fully cooperate regardless of what others do, and they sustain this even when one group member persistently under-contributes. Their contributions are extremely stable and high across the game, with only one clear, deliberate deviation to zero and some confusing misalignment between their stated intent and their actual contribution in the last few rounds.\n\nThey explicitly articulate the payoff structure and appear to understand the marginal per-capita return: they state that holding back any coins reduces one’s own final payoff. This strongly suggests they internalize a “social efficiency” norm: fully contributing both maximizes group welfare and, under this multiplier, is individually payoff-maximizing given that others are contributing high amounts.\n\nThey are conditional in a limited, coarse way. For most of the game they keep contributing fully, even while one player free-rides. Only after prolonged frustration and an explicit suggestion by another player to switch to zero do they join a coordinated low-contribution move once. This appears more like a protest or experiment than a shift to a new strategy, since they immediately revert to high contributions afterward.\n\nRisk tolerance is relatively high in the cooperative direction. They repeatedly expose themselves to exploitation by the under-contributor and never seriously adopt a defensive low-contribution strategy. When they do momentarily switch to zero, they do so in a context of group-level “punishment” or experimentation, not out of ongoing fear of being exploited.\n\nNear the end of the game, their stated plan (“0”) does not always match their actual contributions (which remain high). This mismatch could be due to mis-clicks, confusion, or strategic misrepresentation; the transcript does not resolve this, so any strategic explanation is low-confidence. What is clear is that they remain largely committed to maximal contributions through to the end.\n\nFairness norms are present but subordinate to efficiency. They recognize that low contributors are “screwing themselves,” and they endorse the view that fully contributing is the rational thing to do. However, they tolerate persistent free-riding for most of the game before briefly supporting a zero-contribution response. Their behavior suggests they value mutual gain and efficiency more than punishing unfairness, and they are willing to shoulder exploitation costs for that.\n\nIn a new PGG, this type tends to:\n- Start with full contributions.\n- Maintain high contributions even under moderate free-riding.\n- Only consider dropping contributions after prolonged, salient norms violations and clear group-level talk about doing so.\n- Default back to full cooperation if there is any ambiguity about group strategy or if the payoff logic still clearly favors maximal giving.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThis player communicates as a pragmatic, somewhat dry, analytically minded cooperator with occasional sarcasm and light humor.\n\nThey participate actively in chat but do not dominate it. Their tone is mostly calm and explanatory, with short, pointed messages. They explicitly explain the mechanics to others, emphasizing that keeping coins uninvested is individually worse because the contributed pool is multiplied and redistributed. They correct misunderstandings about the interface and clarify how clicking options affects contributions. This indicates a didactic and rational style rather than an emotional or purely normative one.\n\nThey use humor and light teasing but avoid direct personal attacks. They laugh with others when a group member is suspected of being a plant or troll and contribute playful comments about the experiment’s nature. Even when they believe the problematic player “knows what they’re doing,” their language remains relatively mild and more observational than hostile.\n\nCoordination attempts are present but not highly directive. Early on, they reinforce the emerging “max contribution” norm by stating that holding back makes no sense and leads to lower payoffs. Later, when another influential player suggests a collective switch to zero contributions, they verbally agree and follow through once, showing willingness to align with group-level strategies. They also try to influence the suspected troll’s behavior at least once by suggesting a specific contribution pattern, though this may be more tongue-in-cheek than genuine guidance.\n\nThey are responsive and engaged with others’ questions and comments, answering practical questions about the interface and game length and acknowledging others’ observations. They also occasionally reference the study context (e.g., speculating about researchers), showing meta-awareness of the environment.\n\nIn conflict situations, they side with the majority cooperators, mildly delegitimize the persistent free-rider as intentional rather than confused, and support strategies to neutralize that player’s advantage. However, they do not escalate insults and still occasionally frame their remarks as trying to help that player understand they are hurting themselves.\n\nIn a new PGG, this type:\n- Talks enough to signal understanding and support coordination, but not excessively.\n- Emphasizes payoff logic over moralizing when persuading others to cooperate.\n- Uses dry humor and mild sarcasm, especially when confronting perceived trolling.\n- Listens to and sometimes follows prominent group coordination proposals, even when they temporarily conflict with their default cooperative stance."

The deviations from full contribution are not random; they appear as deliberate tests of what happens when they keep more for themselves, and as brief episodes of free-riding.

They respond to changes in others’ cooperation, especially when group contributions are high: when the rest of the group is highly cooperative, they still contribute a lot, but they sometimes reduce their own contribution slightly, suggesting a willingness to trade off a bit of personal gain against the already-secured group benefit. At the same time, when others’ contributions are low or mixed, they frequently continue to contribute heavily anyway, implying that they are not a strict conditional cooperator. Instead, they act more like a “robust cooperator with occasional opportunism”: they test the gains from deviation but seem unwilling to maintain a low-contribution strategy for long.\n\nThere is an underlying fairness or reciprocity norm in the sense that they plainly dislike being the only one carrying the group; yet they tolerate some free-riding and do not systematically mirror others’ low contributions.

Given the game structure, full contribution is individually costly relative to free-riding, yet they repeatedly choose it. This reflects either a strong intrinsic preference for cooperation or a belief that collective cooperation is likely enough to justify their stance. They also occasionally free-ride themselves when it is clearly profitable to do so, showing they understand the payoff structure and are not purely altruistic or naive.

Their behavior does not waver in response to insults, threats, or changing contributions by a few others; they maintain the same cooperative strategy throughout. This suggests they either understand the material incentives and follow a “maximize group returns” rule, or they adopt a simple “do the fair/expected thing” heuristic and stick to it.

Risk tolerance appears moderate to high regarding social risk: they accept being singled out and punished in the chat without adjusting their contribution pattern, indicating they are not using contributions strategically to appease others. Their fairness norm is focused on contributing what they see as the correct amount; they do not try to calibrate contributions to punishers or allies, and they never attempt to exploit the public good for private gain.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThe player’s communication is extremely sparse and front‑loaded. Early on, they join the initial pro-cooperation norm with a short, approving confirmation that they are also contributing the maximum. After that, they fall completely silent for the remainder of the interaction, even as they become a focal target of extensive ridicule and threats. They do not defend themselves, do not argue their case, and do not attempt to persuade others or negotiate around punishment. This pattern indicates an avoidance-based communication style once conflict emerges: they withdraw from the social arena rather than contesting status or reputation. Their tone in the single early message is neutral‑positive and cooperative, not aggressive or moralizing. They do not publicly justify their choices or confront others’ bullying, which makes their underlying motives partially opaque to the group. They also show no apparent responsiveness to repeated direct address; even sustained, escalating attempts to provoke them do not elicit any further messages. This suggests either a deliberate choice to disengage from chat or a strong preference to let actions (consistent max contributions) speak for themselves rather than words.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThere is no observable end-game unraveling in this player’s contribution behavior. They continue to contribute the full amount through the final rounds, with no sign of tapering cooperation as the game approaches its conclusion. Their strategy appears horizon-insensitive: the knowledge that the game is finite and nearing the end does not induce them to defect or experiment with lower contributions. They also do not alter their behavior in response to late-game coalition talk against them; despite others openly planning to sacrifice their own earnings to punish them at the end, the player does not retaliate, bargain, or reduce contributions. This consistent pattern suggests they either follow a rule-based strategy (“always contribute the max when it’s efficient for the group”) or they place little weight on short-term personal payoff optimization in the final rounds. Their absence from late-game chat makes it impossible to infer any explicit reasoning or emotional reaction to the end-game dynamics; their internal beliefs and feelings about the group’s plan to target them at the end remain unknown.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThe player never uses the punishment option at any point and appears to ignore social prompts to participate in sanctioning. This is a stable feature of their behavior: they refrain from punishment both when others under-contribute and when they themselves become a central target of hostile talk and threats. There is no evidence of either deterrence-oriented punishment (to enforce group norms) or retaliation (to respond to personal attacks), despite many opportunities and strong social cues to do so. This strongly suggests a “non-punisher” or punishment-averse type. Their abstention does not shift even when sanctioning is framed by others as justified or necessary. Whether this is driven by principled rejection of punitive behavior, indifference to others’ choices, lack of concern for enforcement, or a narrow focus on contribution decisions alone is unknown. However, in practice, they behave as a pure cooperator who does not invest in second-order enforcement and does not engage in costly social control, even under direct provocation."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a high, mostly stable contributor once the game begins in earnest. After an initial complete free ride, they shift to contributing the full endowment almost every round, with only a brief moderate contribution phase in the middle. Their contributions then remain consistently high through the end of the game, including the final round, with no visible end-game decay. They do not seem to condition their own contribution on others’ deviations: they keep giving fully even when a persistent low contributor remains in the group and even when there is substantial punishment chaos. This pattern suggests a strong cooperation norm that is largely unconditional rather than tit-for-tat. They tolerate the presence of a clear free rider without reducing their own contribution, indicating low sensitivity to inequity in the contribution stage and a willingness to sustain the public good even when it is not individually payoff-maximizing. Risk tolerance appears moderate to high: they repeatedly expose themselves to potential exploitation and to punishment from others yet do not hedge by lowering contributions.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nUnknown. There is no chat content or explicit messaging in the transcript, so their tone, coordination attempts, and direct persuasion style cannot be inferred. Indirectly, their behavior is “quietly cooperative”: they maintain high contributions without using punishment (after one episode), which functions as an implicit cooperative signal rather than an explicit attempt at coordination. Responsiveness to others via text, and any preference for engagement vs. avoidance in chat, is unknown.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThey display no classic end-game defection. Contributions stay at or near the maximum through the final block of rounds, including the very last round, despite clear evidence that at least one other player persistently contributes nothing and that punishment is intense and costly in the group. There is no sign that they shorten their time horizon or shift to short-term payoff maximization as the number of remaining rounds shrinks. Instead, they maintain their cooperative strategy up to the end. This suggests either a stable preference for cooperation that is not discounted by the looming end of the interaction, or a rule-based strategy (“I always contribute fully”) that is insensitive to horizon effects. They also do not increase punishment near the end, indicating they are not trying to “settle scores” or engage in last-round retaliation.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey almost never use punishment. Across the game they impose it only once. When they do punish, it is broad rather than selective: they target multiple players, including those who are contributing relatively high amounts as well as the obvious free rider. Because punishers are anonymous, they cannot signal or clarify motives. The choice to punish in that episode is not tightly aligned with contribution levels; it does not look like clean norm-enforcing punishment of low contributors. This single, scattered punishment event may reflect a moment of frustration with the overall pattern of deductions and chaos, or an exploratory test of the punishment mechanism, rather than a stable strategy. After this, they revert to zero punishment, even though others continue to impose heavy deductions and they themselves become a frequent target. They do not retaliate when punished and do not escalate. Overall, they are a highly reluctant punisher, not using punishment instrumentally to shape others’ behavior, and showing no consistent pattern of deterrence or revenge.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey are repeatedly punished and often lose substantial payoff due to others’ deductions, yet they do not respond by punishing back or reducing cooperation. Instead, they persist with high contributions and minimal punishment expenditure. This indicates either emotional resilience or detachment from the payoff comparisons: they are not visibly driven by envy or by a desire to restore relative standing via punishment. They also do not appear to reward through “indirect” means such as selectively increasing their own contributions in response to cooperative subgroups; their own contribution pattern is stable and not strongly differentiated by which co-players are present or doing well. Overall, they behave as a robust cooperator who is largely non-reactive to the structure of others’ outcomes—continuing to provide the public good and absorbing both exploitation and punishment without strategic adjustment."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a strict, unwavering full cooperator. They always contribute the maximum allowed amount and never experiment with lower contributions, even when others free‑ride persistently and the game becomes long and frustrating. Their cooperation is clearly principled rather than purely payoff‑maximizing: they explicitly endorse the norm that everyone should always give the maximum and state that they personally will keep doing so regardless of others’ behavior, framing it as “fair for everyone else.” They understand the payoff structure well and advocate the fully cooperative outcome as both efficient and equitable. There is no sign of conditional cooperation; their strategy is essentially “unconditional full contribution,” anchored in a fairness norm and a desire for group efficiency, not in reciprocal tit‑for‑tat. They tolerate substantial exploitation by free‑riders without ever reducing their own contribution, indicating low willingness to protect themselves materially and high willingness to bear costs for the social ideal. Risk tolerance in payoff terms is high: they are willing to risk being exploited for the chance of collective cooperation. Their contributions remain stable even as boredom, time overruns, and others’ cynicism mount, suggesting strong norm internalization and low volatility.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThey take an early and explicit leadership role in coordination, opening with a clear proposal for everyone to contribute maximally and to avoid punishment so that the group collectively maximizes payoffs. Their tone is prosocial, pragmatic, and mildly humorous; they are firm about norms but not aggressive. They reiterate agreement with other norm‑supporting players and help reinforce the “all max” convention, sometimes summarizing the study instructions or payoff logic to keep others aligned. They track who is cooperating and who is not, calling attention to discrepancies without directly attacking individuals; when they do label someone negatively, they do it briefly and in a somewhat playful shorthand rather than sustained hostility. They are responsive to group concerns about lag, boredom, and payment, sharing information they have from the study page and expressing concern that the effective hourly rate is too low, but they still encourage people to see the game through. They also speculate lightly about the experiment’s design and purpose, indicating engagement and meta‑reflection. Socially, they are collaborative, information‑sharing, and group‑oriented, with moderate tolerance for frustration and a tendency to keep the mood from becoming too hostile or defeatist.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey are generally reluctant to punish and do not treat punishment as a routine tool; for much of the game they spend nothing on deductions despite repeated free‑riding by others. When they do move toward punishment, it is framed as a group‑sanctioning strategy (“start punishing?”, “all zeros minused from here”), suggesting they see punishment mainly as a coordinated deterrent against persistent zero‑contributors rather than as personal revenge. Their actual spending on punishment is limited and concentrated late in the game, and it appears targeted at clear free‑riders rather than used indiscriminately, implying selective use based on blatant norm violation. They never retaliate for harm done to themselves (they are never punished) and show no interest in using punishment to settle interpersonal scores; the motive is enforcement of the contribution norm and protection of group welfare. Even as others grow cynical and some begin contributing zero, they keep their own contributions at maximum and only modestly increase punishment, indicating that while they do accept costly sanctioning in principle, they prioritize maintaining their own cooperative identity over escalating punitive behavior. Overall, they are a norm‑enforcing altruist: willing to punish defectors when free‑riding is obvious and repeated, but using punishment sparingly, in a measured and group‑oriented way rather than aggressively."

Their contributions remain high even when others repeatedly give nothing and when group frustration with the game’s length becomes salient. They accept a personally lower payoff rather than reduce their contribution, indicating a strong fairness or principle‑driven norm rather than narrow payoff maximization. There is no evidence that they experiment with contributing less or condition their behavior on others’ past actions; they appear to treat “always full contribution” as the correct or default strategy and stick to it. Risk tolerance is moderate to high in the sense that they willingly expose themselves to exploitation by low contributors but do not hedge against that risk by reducing their own input.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThey communicate infrequently and briefly, but when they do speak, it is socially oriented rather than technical or hostile. Early on they offer a neutral acknowledgment in response to ongoing discussion, showing they pay attention to group chat but are not trying to lead coordination. Later, they make a light, mildly teasing remark about others being greedy, which criticizes free‑riding while staying playful rather than aggressive. Near the end, they suggest contacting the experimenters, which shows concern about fairness of the overall situation (time vs. payment) and some initiative in problem‑solving, but they still do not dominate the conversation. They neither propose explicit contribution schemes nor argue at length about norms; instead they align behaviorally with the cooperative norm and occasionally comment around it. Their style is engaged but low‑intensity: they join the social atmosphere, show awareness of others’ frustration, and hint at a shared interest in being treated fairly by the organizers, without attempting to direct group strategy.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey use punishment selectively and sparingly. Across the game, they do impose costly deductions a few times, but in small amounts and only in the presence of clear, repeated zero contributions by specific others. There is no sign of retaliatory punishment toward those who punish, and they are never themselves targeted, suggesting their own contributions are consistently cooperative. Their pattern is most consistent with mild norm‑enforcing altruistic punishment: they accept some personal cost to sanction obvious free‑riders and likely aim to encourage higher contributions rather than to vent anger. The total volume of punishment is low relative to opportunities, indicating a reluctance to over‑spend on sanctions and a preference to maintain their cooperative stance over escalating conflict. They do not publicly discuss whom they punish or threaten punishment in chat, so their deterrence is entirely via actions rather than verbal signals. Overall, they are a principled cooperator who is willing, but not eager, to pay a modest cost to discipline persistent defectors."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a stable, unconditional full cooperator. They always contribute the maximum allowed amount in every round, without deviation, despite persistent free-riding by several others and despite increasing boredom and frustration. Their contribution behavior does not become more selfish when others defect, and they do not experiment with low contributions even late in the game or once they know the study has timed out on the platform side. This suggests a strong internal fairness or “do the right thing” norm that is not tightly conditioned on others’ behavior or on marginal incentives in any given round. They appear risk- and hassle-averse in the sense of not tinkering with alternatives; once they understand the simple “max is good for the group” structure, they stick to it. They do not invoke the payoff structure explicitly, but they accept and follow the emergent group norm of contributing fully. Their focus in later rounds shifts from the payoffs to wanting the game to end, yet they still keep contributing fully, indicating that honoring the implicit cooperation rule and “seeing it through” matters more to them than expressing frustration through selfish play.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThey are relatively quiet compared with the most vocal players, but they do participate and engage when the discussion turns to time, boredom, and study logistics. Their tone is casual and mildly humorous, using light sarcasm and internet slang, which signals sociability rather than hostility. They do not attempt to organize contribution levels, argue about who is defecting, or morally lecture others; instead they let others handle norm-enforcement talk. Their main communicative concern is pacing and duration: they repeatedly comment that the game is dragging, emphasize that waiting time exceeds actual gameplay, and push the group to decide or act faster. When others consider leaving, they explicitly tell people they “have to see it through,” revealing an internalized obligation to complete the task and a preference for collective follow-through over individual exit, even after timeouts. They also engage in pragmatic, informational chat (e.g., clarifying the coin–money conversion) and logistical questions (how to obtain the completion code), indicating attentiveness to the experimental context and their earnings. Overall, their style is cooperative, mildly impatient, and task-focused: they engage enough to coordinate expectations about time and payoff, but avoid conflict-heavy or accusatory exchanges and do not lead coalition-building around punishment.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey never spend any resources on punishment at any point, despite having many opportunities and despite obvious, repeated free-riding by specific players. They also never publicly encourage others to punish or reference punishment as a tool, and they do not complain directly about defectors. Their norm-enforcement behavior instead channels into social pressure about completion and speed, not into monetary sanctions. This pattern is consistent with a “non-punitive cooperator” type: they uphold cooperative norms themselves and tolerate some degree of exploitation rather than paying to sanction others. Their non-use of punishment persists even when they are clearly bored and when many others mention or implicitly endorse punishing low contributors, suggesting that their reluctance is principled or at least stable, not just early-game caution. They do not display any retaliatory motives; there is no evidence they attempt to identify, track, or target particular low contributors. Their primary deterrence mechanism, if any, is mild social nudging about staying through the task, not the formal punishment mechanism."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a stable, unconditional full cooperator in this environment. They always contribute their entire endowment, regardless of others’ previous choices, occasional free-riding, or uncertainty about others’ identities. Their behavior fits a “principled cooperator” type: they state that they come in with a fixed plan and then follow it consistently, without visible adjustment to short-term incentives. They appear to value group efficiency and fairness over individual gain, continuing to cooperate even when one player repeatedly free-rides and when others experiment with punishment and reward. There is no evidence of contingent or conditional cooperation; they do not lower contributions in response to defection. Risk tolerance seems high: they accept the risk of exploitation by low contributors without hedging. Their contribution rule appears simple and norm-driven rather than payoff-calculating.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThey communicate in a friendly, relaxed, and prosocial tone, using humor, light teasing, and emoticons. They quickly join early coordination efforts around full contribution and explicitly endorse no use of deductions, supporting a cooperative, non-hostile norm. They also reassure others when mistakes happen, downplaying blame and maintaining group harmony. They show curiosity and social engagement by initiating small talk (locations, time) and engaging in the “are we bots?” theme, but without trying to manipulate contributions or sanctions. Their persuasion style is soft and playful rather than forceful; when addressing a previous free-rider, they nudge them with light humor instead of moralizing or threatening. They respond to others’ comments and follow conversational threads, indicating attentiveness and a preference for a positive, human-feeling group atmosphere. Overall, they engage rather than withdraw, but keep the focus on camaraderie and stable norms rather than hard bargaining.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey never use punishment, despite clear opportunities and at least one repeated free-rider in the group. They publicly endorse a no-punishment norm, framing deductions as something they will not use and implicitly as something undesirable for the group. Their behavior suggests an aversion to efficiency-reducing sanctions: they maintain contributions without resorting to deterrence, even when low contributors benefit more. There is no evidence of retaliatory motives; they are never targeted by punishment, so we cannot infer their response to being punished. Their stance appears principled and group-focused rather than merely self-protective: they maintain non-punishment even after observing others use punishment sporadically. Selectivity cannot be assessed in detail because they simply abstain across all situations. The type is best described as “non-punishing cooperator” with a preference for maintaining a positive, non-threatening social climate.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey never allocate rewards, even though they experience rewards themselves and see others using rewarding to encourage cooperation. This indicates a consistent “no sanctions” policy that encompasses both negative and positive incentives. The absence of rewarding is not driven by lack of cooperative partners—almost everyone consistently contributes—so the most plausible interpretation is that they prefer to rely on unconditional contributions and social norms rather than costly incentive mechanisms. There is no explicit statement about reward use, so underlying motives are uncertain: they may see rewards as inefficient, unnecessary, or as complicating a simple cooperative strategy. They do not visibly use reward to express gratitude, to build alliances, or to reinforce high contributors’ behavior. Overall, they act as a pure contributor who expects the contribution decision alone to carry their cooperative intent.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey observe others’ contributions and sanctioning behavior but keep their own strategy unchanged. When another participant accidentally fails to contribute, they respond with understanding and reassurance, not with blame or sanction, indicating a generous interpretation of ambiguous low contributions. When a previously low contributor later free-rides again and gains higher payoffs, they react with mild disappointment expressed in a light, social way, and still do not punish or reduce their own contribution. They acknowledge and tolerate others’ use of punishment and reward, without commenting directly on its fairness or efficiency, and without reacting strategically (no retaliation, no reciprocal rewarding). Their reactions suggest that they prioritize maintaining a cooperative, friendly norm over optimizing personal payoff or enforcing strict reciprocity. They appear robust to inequality in outcomes and to occasional deviations by others, staying anchored to a pre-set cooperative plan rather than adapting to observed payoffs."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a stable, unconditional full cooperator in this environment. They always contribute their entire endowment, even when others free-ride or when they themselves are punished. Their own chat explicitly indicates that they see non-contribution as irrational given the multiplier, suggesting they internalize the social-efficiency logic rather than focusing on narrow self-interest. They do not visibly condition their cooperation on specific others’ behavior; they continue with full contributions through both cooperative and defecting behavior from others. This pattern is consistent with a “principled cooperator” type, whose baseline is to maximize group surplus and who is willing to risk being exploited by free-riders rather than reduce their own cooperative standard. There is no evidence of strategic hedging or experimentation with lower contributions; risk tolerance regarding being exploited appears high, and fairness concerns do not translate into reduced giving.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThe player’s communication is sparse, direct, and prosocial. Early on they signal agreement with a cooperative plan and later offer a light social nudge to a previous non-contributor, framed in a mildly admonishing but non-hostile way. They also briefly comment on the logic of the game, expressing that not contributing “seems a bit stupid,” which indicates they try to frame cooperation as the obvious or rational choice rather than as a moral demand. Beyond that, they engage minimally in side conversations but do respond when addressed or when the topic touches on human-ness or location, offering a short self-disclosure about where they are from. Their tone remains friendly and non-confrontational throughout; they do not escalate when others defect or when they themselves are punished. Overall, they engage just enough to endorse cooperation and confirm they are part of the group, but they avoid leading long discussions or policing others in chat.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThe player never uses punishment, even when there are clear opportunities: they experience being punished themselves and observe repeated free-riding by another player, yet they refrain from retaliating or sanctioning. This suggests a strong reluctance to burn value through negative sanctions, aligning with a payoff-efficiency orientation and possibly a personal norm against spite or retaliation. Their earlier acceptance of a “no deduct” norm expressed by others is consistent with this: they do not contradict the idea that punishment removes value and should be avoided, and their behavior follows that norm strictly. There is no exhibited pattern of targeted or generalized punishment, no evidence of second-order punishment, and no sign they use punishment as a deterrent. Whether they would ever punish in more extreme circumstances is unknown; within the environment observed, they behave as a non-punisher.\n\n<REWARD>\nThe player also never uses rewards, despite having multiple opportunities in cooperative environments and seeing others engage with the reward mechanism. This indicates that while they value cooperation and publicly endorse it, they do not invest their own payoff in reinforcing others’ good behavior through the formal reward tool. Possible motives include a strictly payoff-maximizing stance regarding side-payments, a belief that the public good mechanism itself sufficiently rewards cooperation, or a preference for low-effort, low-cost social nudges over material incentives. They do accept rewards when others give them and do not comment on them, suggesting they are comfortable benefiting from others’ prosocial transfers but do not reciprocate via the same channel. Whether they might reward in a setting with stronger gratitude norms or different costs/benefits is unknown; here they are a non-rewarder.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThe player shows limited overt reaction to others’ payoff consequences. They experience unexplained punishment and do not protest, complain, or seek revenge, implying low sensitivity to personal slights or a preference to ignore noise in outcomes rather than destabilize cooperation. They observe another player repeatedly profiting from low or zero contribution and large earnings while the group cooperates; their only reaction is an early, mild social prompt encouraging that player to contribute, without any subsequent escalation despite continued free-riding and that player’s use of the punishment tool. They also see others spend on rewards and punishment, including costly positive transfers to them, yet they neither mirror this behavior nor verbally express gratitude. Taken together, this pattern suggests a type who tracks the main strategic variables (who contributes) more than the side-payoff details (who spends on sanctions or rewards), and who prioritizes maintaining their own cooperative strategy over responding to every payoff asymmetry or interpersonal signal. Their adaptation to others’ outcomes appears minimal; they maintain consistent behavior rather than updating in response to observed deductions, grants, or cost patterns."

They always choose to contribute their entire endowment, even when at least one other group member free-rides and even after seeing that free-riders earn strictly more in those instances. There is no observable adjustment to others’ deviations: they neither reduce their contribution in response to repeated non-contribution by a peer nor increase it in response to full cooperation (since they are already at the maximum). This suggests that, in this setup, they prioritize a norm of consistent cooperation over payoff-maximizing adaptation. \n\nThey appear comfortable accepting some degree of exploitation: they continue to fully contribute when a peer repeatedly contributes nothing and benefits from the pot. Their behavior is consistent with someone who treats cooperation as the “right” or default action rather than as a contingent response. Risk tolerance around being exploited is therefore high; they do not hedge against potential defection. Whether this norm is driven by outcome-based fairness, moral preference for contributing, or experiment demand effects is unknown. Their contribution pattern shows no signs of volatility or experimentation.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThey speak rarely and only when directly relevant to a social check rather than to strategy. They do not initiate coordination about contribution, punishment, or reward; others do that. They join a light social exchange about location and identity and provide a brief, factual self-disclosure consistent with the ongoing chat. They do not comment on who contributes, who free-rides, or how the group should treat defectors. \n\nThe tone is neutral and cooperative; there is no visible frustration or moralizing toward free-riders or punishers/rewarders. They also do not use chat to push others toward higher cooperation or to discourage counterproductive punishment. Overall, they show low verbal engagement with the strategic aspects of the game and minimal persuasion attempts, while still signaling that they are a real, sociable participant rather than a silent bot.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey never use punishment, despite having repeated opportunities and clear targets who contribute nothing and benefit more as a result. The fact that others sometimes punish a high contributor by mistake, and that punishment in general is shown to destroy value, does not trigger any retaliatory or corrective punishment from them. \n\nThis behavior is consistent with a strong reluctance to engage in payoff-destructive sanctions, even for deterrence or norm enforcement. They do not appear motivated by retributive justice or by the desire to discipline free-riders. If they hold a belief about punishment at all, it likely emphasizes its social or efficiency cost over its enforcement benefit, but this is inferred only from inaction and is low-confidence. They show no evidence of selective punishment or threshold-based triggers; their stance appears to be a blanket avoidance of punishing.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey also never use reward, even though others reward high contributors at times and clearly incur personal costs to do so. They continue to fully cooperate without providing any positive reinforcement to others’ contributions. This suggests that they do not treat reward as a necessary tool for sustaining cooperation or as a vehicle for expressing gratitude. \n\nGiven that the reward technology is strictly efficiency-reducing at the group level, one interpretation is that they avoid both punishment and reward as wasteful side-payments that reduce net payoff. However, this is speculative; all that is firmly grounded is their consistent abstention from rewarding. They rely purely on their own stable cooperative behavior rather than on incentive engineering through rewards.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey observe that some players free-ride and earn more in those rounds, that some players spend on punishment and reward, and that these side-actions change payoffs. Despite that, they do not modify their own contributions or start to use punishment/reward in response. Their cooperative strategy remains unchanged regardless of whether free-riders profit, punishers mis-target, or rewarders sacrifice their own earnings.\n\nThey do not verbally react to payoff differences, to someone being punished despite contributing, or to others burning resources to reward cooperators. There is no visible signaling of approval or disapproval of any of these behaviors. This indicates a type who is behaviorally robust: they maintain their own norm of full cooperation while remaining largely indifferent in action and speech to others’ payoff-related choices. Any internal beliefs about fairness or efficiency are not explicitly expressed, so beyond “continues to cooperate regardless of others’ outcomes,” their evaluative stance toward others’ costs and benefits is unknown."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a stable, unconditional full contributor. They always contribute their entire endowment, regardless of others’ behavior or recent deviations from full cooperation. Their pattern does not react to occasional non-contribution by others, including when free-riding is repeated and goes unpunished. This suggests a strong internal norm favoring group efficiency and fairness over short-term individual gain. They appear willing to tolerate being exploited rather than risk undermining cooperation. There is no observable risk-taking in the sense of experimenting with lower contributions; instead, they consistently choose the socially efficient but individually vulnerable option. Their behavior fits a “principled cooperator” or “idealistic cooperator” type: contribution decisions remain cooperative even when others’ incentives to free-ride become salient.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThe player never sends any chat messages, despite active discussion among others. This indicates a strong preference for silent engagement and non-verbal signaling through choices rather than through persuasion or coordination attempts. They do not correct misperceptions, do not join norm-enforcing talk, and do not participate in the social bonding chatter. This suggests either low interest in social interaction, a deliberate choice to avoid influencing others explicitly, or discomfort/indifference toward chatting in this context. However, their cooperative and prosocial actions (especially rewarding) show they are engaged with the game’s social structure; they simply choose to express preferences through behavior, not words. They are responsive in action but not in dialogue.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey never use punishment, even when clear free-riding occurs and when others have previously used punishment against low contributors. This indicates a strong reluctance to reduce others’ payoffs, even at low personal cost. Their inaction holds both when punishing low contributors could be justified by fairness norms and when punishment might help sustain cooperation. This suggests they prioritize avoiding harm over enforcing norms via negative sanctions. There is no evidence of retaliatory motives, moralistic anger, or strategic deterrence; they do not appear to use punishment as a tool at all. Their type aligns with a “non-punitive cooperator” who relies, if anything, on positive incentives rather than threats.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey display a one-off but very strong willingness to reward: in one instance, they spend a substantial amount to reward every other group member, including someone who had just free-ridden previously. This blanket rewarding is non-discriminatory and not tightly conditioned on individual contribution levels, and it occurs when the group as a whole is cooperating. This behavior looks like an attempt to broadly reinforce and sustain a cooperative climate rather than to selectively reward only the most deserving. After this large reward outlay, they never reward again, even when cooperation continues or when others begin to reward selectively. This suggests that the big rewarding move is either (a) an early investment to set a prosocial tone, (b) a test of the mechanism, or (c) a one-time expression of generosity rather than an ongoing strategy. Overall, they are clearly more willing to use positive than negative incentives, but they do not persist in costly rewarding once cooperation is already established and stable.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey observe others’ outcomes, including instances of both punishment and reward, but make no visible reactive adjustments in contribution or sanctioning. They keep contributing fully regardless of who earns more or less, and regardless of others’ spending on punishment or reward. When someone free-rides and is not heavily sanctioned, they do not respond by lowering their own contribution or by stepping in to punish. When others later start using rewards selectively, they do not imitate or complement that behavior. Their only strong reaction to others’ outcomes is the early, broad reward of everyone, which coincides with a fully cooperative outcome and widespread high payoffs. After that, they essentially ignore payoff differences and continue their cooperative strategy without fine-tuning. This pattern suggests that they treat others’ outcomes primarily as confirmation that cooperation is working rather than as signals to optimize or redistribute. They appear payoff-aware but not payoff-driven, anchoring on a personal norm of full cooperation and minimal interference in others’ earnings."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a strict, unconditional full contributor. They always allocate their entire endowment to the public good, regardless of partner behavior, history of free-riding, or stage of the game. Their strategy is extremely stable and shows no experimentation or sensitivity to short-term payoffs. They do not adjust downward when others contribute less, and they do not adjust upward because they already contribute at the maximum. This pattern is consistent both when partners match their contribution and when at least one partner persistently free-rides. They therefore follow an internal cooperative rule rather than reacting to fairness concerns or payoff optimization. Risk tolerance appears high with respect to being exploited, and they do not respond to the strategic risk that others may defect.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nUnknown; there is no observable chat content from this player. Their social style in communication, preference for coordination or persuasion, and responsiveness to messages are therefore all unknown.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThe player shows no end-game decay in cooperation. They continue to fully contribute even as the game approaches the final rounds and in the final round itself, despite having clear information about the finite horizon. There is no observable attempt to “cash out” privately at the end, suggesting either that they disregard standard backward-induction reasoning, or that maintaining cooperative behavior is a dominant personal rule for them independent of horizon length. They neither escalate nor reduce their use of punishment or reward at the end; their inaction on sanctions remains constant.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThis player never uses punishment, even when a partner repeatedly contributes nothing while another partner contributes fully. They also do not use punishment when a new low contributor appears very late in the game. They therefore tolerate free-riding without observable retaliatory behavior. This could reflect a principle against harming others, an aversion to the cost of punishment, a belief that punishment is unnecessary or ineffective, or simple inertia; the exact motive is unknown. They also do not engage in “altruistic punishment” to protect the cooperative co-player from exploitation. Their non-use of punishment is stable across the entire game, not contingent on specific contribution patterns. They do not engage in antisocial punishment either, but that is consistent with their blanket non-use of sanctions rather than selective prosociality.\n\n<REWARD>\nThis player also never uses rewards, even toward consistently high-contributing partners. They do not spend to positively reinforce cooperation, despite having cooperators available and a clearly beneficial group outcome from mutual contribution. The lack of rewarding persists regardless of whether others match their cooperative behavior or whether a free-rider is present. This suggests that, while they are willing to incur large opportunity costs to contribute to the public good, they are not willing to incur additional direct costs to individually incentivize or thank others. Whether this reflects a belief that rewards are inefficient, a desire to keep decisions simple, or indifference to targeted reciprocity is unknown. Their cooperative stance is thus expressed solely through their own contributions, not through sanctioning mechanisms."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a stable, unconditional high contributor. They consistently allocate their full endowment to the public fund every round, regardless of how much others give, whether cooperation is high or low, and whether they are personally being rewarded. They behave as if full cooperation is the default and morally or strategically “right” choice, rather than something to be varied in response to others’ behavior.\n\nTheir contributions do not appear contingent on short-term payoff maximization: they continue to cooperate fully even when the group under-contributes and their own per-round payoff is relatively low. This suggests a strong internal norm in favor of contributing, with low sensitivity to exploitation risk. They tolerate free-riding by others without retaliating through reduced contributions.\n\nThey seem comfortable shouldering more than their “fair share” when others contribute less, yet they also remain engaged and mildly critical when some players do not match the cooperative norm. Overall, they embody a prosocial, high-trust type who treats contribution as a near-absolute rule, not a negotiable strategy.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nTheir communication is sparse but socially attuned. They respond politely to greetings and acknowledge successful coordination with a brief, positive signal. Their tone is friendly and light; they use a small expressive cue (a simple emotive symbol) once cooperation stabilizes, which reads as contentment or relief at the emerging norm.\n\nThey do not initiate detailed strategic proposals, but they do make at least one pointed, critical remark aimed at those not fully cooperating, implying awareness of and mild frustration with perceived hypocrisy or free-riding. This criticism is framed in a casual, somewhat joking style rather than overt aggression, suggesting they prefer soft social pressure over confrontational shaming.\n\nThey are reactive rather than leading in the chat: they respond after others talk about strategies and contributions, and they do not attempt to micro-coordinate specific contribution levels or reward patterns. Their engagement style is low-frequency but responsive, with a mix of politeness and light norm enforcement through comments rather than detailed argument.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey are willing but selective in using the reward mechanism. They rarely spend on rewards overall, and when they do, they spend modest amounts rather than systematically reinforcing all cooperators. Their use of rewards coincides with periods where others are contributing relatively more, suggesting that their reward behavior is conditional on observed cooperation level.\n\nThey do not use rewards to compensate themselves (since rewarding others is payoff-neutral by design, and they still choose to do it at times), implying that when they pay to reward, they are expressing approval or trying to support cooperative behavior rather than pursuing direct material gain. They show no clear pattern of rewarding in proportion to others’ exact contributions, and they do not reward every time cooperation improves, so their reinforcement is intermittent and somewhat cautious.\n\nThey refrain from rewarding during some full-cooperation episodes, which may reflect uncertainty about the impact of rewards, a desire to conserve payoff, or a belief that verbal and collective norms are sufficient once cooperation is established. They never use rewards punitively or manipulatively (the mechanism is symmetric cost/benefit), and their pattern suggests a primarily prosocial, norm-affirming intent: they are willing to incur small costs to encourage or acknowledge cooperative behavior but do not treat rewarding as a central or heavily strategic tool."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player fits a “quiet conditional cooperator” type. They initially free‑ride once but then reliably fully contribute for the rest of the game, even when small deviations appear.\n\nThey start by not contributing despite strong group messaging in favor of full contributions. After observing that almost everyone else contributes fully and that cooperation is stable, they switch to full contribution and maintain it with no further experimentation. They never adjust their contributions downward in response to others’ occasional low contributions, suggesting a strong tendency to stick with a cooperative norm once it is clearly established.\n\nTheir behavior indicates they condition their cooperation on observed group behavior rather than on chat alone. Once the group proves to be highly cooperative and stable, they behave as a pure cooperator, prioritizing the predictable gains from the public good over potential extra profit from free‑riding. There is no evidence of risk‑seeking experimentation after that initial defection; they appear risk‑averse to disrupting a working cooperative equilibrium.\n\nThey do not seem to enforce strict fairness in the sense of “matching” others’ small deviations; instead, they tolerate minor free‑riding by others while continuing to fully contribute. This suggests they value maintaining high group earnings and smooth play over optimizing their own relative payoff in each round.\n\nOverall: initially self‑interested and cautious, quickly turning into a stable, high‑trust contributor once others’ cooperation is proven, with low volatility and no end‑game unraveling.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nUnknown. The transcript shows no chat messages from this player, so their communication style, tone, and responsiveness in chat are not observable.\n\nGiven their silence despite active group conversation about norms, strategy, and off‑topic topics, it is plausible (but low confidence) that they prefer to observe and adapt rather than lead or persuade. They do not participate in coordination attempts, do not publicly praise or criticize anyone, and do not use chat to signal intentions. This makes them a “quiet observer” socially: they follow the emergent norm without engaging in explicit norm talk.\n\nAny further inference about personality (e.g., shyness, strategic silence, multitasking) would be speculative, so it is unknown.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey never use the punishment mechanism. This holds even when some players occasionally contribute nothing. Their non‑use is consistent and not obviously driven by fear of retaliation, since punishers are identifiable but the environment is highly cooperative and socially light‑hearted.\n\nThis pattern suggests several traits:\n- Strong reluctance to incur personal costs to sanction others, even when sanctioning could be justified by free‑riding.\n- Preference for “cooperation without enforcement” once a good norm exists; they rely on the group’s cooperative momentum rather than reinforcing it with costly punishment.\n- Likely focus on maximizing own absolute earnings and group efficiency, avoiding the inefficiency of costly punishment in an already high‑contribution environment.\n\nThey also ignore peers’ repeated calls to punish defectors, indicating low susceptibility to social pressure toward punitive behavior. There is no evidence of retaliatory motives or desire to correct others via punishment.\n\nOverall, they are a non‑punishing, non‑enforcing cooperator: willing to bear the cost of contributing but not the additional cost of sanctioning.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nUnknown. They are never punished in this game and never punish others, so there is no direct evidence of how they respond to being sanctioned or to identifiable punishers. Their likelihood of forgiving, retaliating, or complying after punishment cannot be inferred from the transcript."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a highly stable, near-unconditional high contributor. After an initial moderate contribution, they quickly move to the maximum possible contribution and then maintain that level with essentially no downward adjustment, even when at least one peer begins to reduce contributions. Their behavior fits a “principled cooperator” or “quasi-unconditional cooperator” type: they prioritize group efficiency and seem committed to a norm of full contribution rather than tailoring their behavior to short-term payoffs.\n\nThey demonstrate strong adherence to an implicit fairness norm in the cooperative phase: when others appear to follow a “everyone contributes the same high amount” standard, they match it rather than exploiting it. When one peer reduces contributions, they do not retaliate or condition their own giving in response; they continue to contribute fully despite the presence of a free-rider. This suggests low sensitivity to mild norm violations, or a willingness to bear some exploitation in order to preserve overall cooperation.\n\nTheir approach shows low risk aversion with respect to being exploited by defectors: they repeatedly expose themselves to the risk that others will benefit disproportionately from their generosity, yet they do not adjust their behavior downward. At the same time, they show no evidence of experimenting with lower contributions to test others’ responses. Overall, they appear guided more by an internal cooperative rule (“contribute fully”) than by reactive or strategic conditional cooperation.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThis player does not use the chat at all in the observed game. They neither initiate coordination nor respond verbally to others’ attempts to organize full contributions. Their cooperative behavior aligns with the cooperative norms some peers advocate, but this alignment is purely behavioral, not communicative.\n\nThe absence of messages makes it unknown whether they are socially reserved, strategically silent, or simply indifferent to chat. They do not publicly praise or criticize others, do not join in encouragement, and do not attempt to sanction or pressure lower contributors via communication. This suggests a low-engagement or passive style in the communication channel: they cooperate consistently but do not use social talk to influence or negotiate group norms.\n\nBecause they never speak, their responsiveness to specific appeals is observable only in their actions: they act in line with high-contribution appeals but never explicitly acknowledge them. Their tone, persuasion style, and willingness to confront or reassure others in chat remain unknown.\n\n<REWARD>\nThis player almost never uses the reward mechanism and appears highly reluctant to spend on rewarding. Across repeated opportunities, they generally choose not to transfer any of their payoff to others, despite facing multiple peers who contribute at the same maximal level as they do. They do not systematically reward high cooperators, even when those cooperators are clearly identifiable and stable.\n\nOn a single occasion, they engage with the reward system in a trivial, payoff-neutral way that results in them both spending and receiving the same small amount. Given the structure of the game and the data available, the direction of that transfer is ambiguous: it may be self-rewarding if that is allowed, or a tiny reward to someone else who simultaneously rewards them. There is no clear pattern of them using reward to reinforce others’ cooperation, nor to build alliances or express gratitude. If they do reward someone else in that instance, it is minimal and does not reflect an ongoing strategy.\n\nOverall, they behave as if reward is either strategically unimportant, too costly relative to its benefit, or simply not salient. They do not appear to use it as a tool to shape behavior, to reciprocate, or to signal approval in any systematic way. Their default is effectively to ignore the reward option.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThey receive an identifiable reward exactly once. Their subsequent behavior does not change: they continue contributing at the same maximal level as before and do not begin to reward others afterwards. There is no clear behavioral evidence of reciprocal rewarding, preferential treatment, or alliance formation with whoever rewarded them (if it was another player). If that transfer is instead self-directed, then there is no external rewarder to respond to.\n\nBecause their cooperation is already at ceiling before and after the reward event, it is impossible to detect any incremental “boost” in contribution caused by being rewarded. They also do not start to spend more on rewards themselves following that experience. Thus, if they appreciate the reward, this appreciation is not expressed through observable strategic changes.\n\nIn new environments with identifiable rewarders, this type is best characterized as non-reactive in material terms: being rewarded does not meaningfully alter their contribution pattern or their use of reward. Their emotional or attitudinal response to being rewarded is unknown; all that is visible is that their cooperative rule (“always contribute fully”) appears independent of whether they are materially recognized for it."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a stable, unconditional high contributor. They always contribute the full endowment in every available decision, including early, mid, and final rounds, despite substantial variation in others’ behavior and despite explicit calls from others to stop contributing near the end. Their cooperation is not contingent on short‑term reciprocation, group averages, or end‑game incentives; they continue to contribute even when free‑riding is visibly profitable and socially endorsed by some others. This indicates a strong internal norm favoring contribution over individual payoff maximization, low willingness to exploit others even when safe, and a readiness to accept payoff disadvantage relative to free riders. Risk tolerance appears moderate: they are willing to “see how things go” early on but ultimately stick with full cooperation regardless of outcome volatility. Their fairness concept seems group‑welfare‑oriented rather than payoff‑equality‑oriented, as they do not adjust contributions to punish defectors or to match the group’s declining average.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nTheir communication is sparse, neutral in tone, and non‑confrontational. They enter the conversation minimally and avoid criticizing or shaming low contributors or free riders, even when others do so. When they speak, they briefly acknowledge joining the cooperative effort and mention that they initially want to observe how the game unfolds before fully committing, which suggests a reflective and cautious mindset. They do not attempt to lead coordination, set explicit norms, or argue about the merits of rewarding or contributing; instead, they quietly align with the cooperative camp. They show no hostility or sarcasm and do not escalate conflicts between other players. Their style is low‑engagement but aligned with cooperation, preferring action (consistent contributions) over extended discussion or persuasion. Responsiveness beyond this is unknown due to limited chat content.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThey exhibit almost no classic end‑game defection. Even when others openly discuss that the final rounds are approaching and some advocate for withholding contributions, they continue to give the full amount. Knowledge of the finite horizon does not translate into reduced cooperation or a shift to self‑interested play. There is no observable last‑round “grab” behavior; instead, their pattern of full contribution persists unchanged. This suggests either a strong internalized cooperative principle that dominates backward‑induction logic, or a belief that sticking with cooperation is preferable even when it is not strategically rewarded in the short run. They do not join the explicit calls to refuse donating in late rounds, nor do they voice frustration about others’ end‑game free‑riding.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey never use the reward mechanism, despite being eligible every round and despite other players using it at least once in the environment. They are aware that rewarding exists (the interface message is shown repeatedly), yet they spend nothing on rewards and receive some reward only early on from others, not reciprocated by them. There is no evidence that they experiment with reward for strategic reinforcement, reciprocity, or norm‑setting. Combined with their consistent high contributions, this pattern resembles a “pure cooperator” who sees contribution as the main vehicle of cooperation and either finds formal rewarding unnecessary, unappealing, or not cost‑effective. Their silence in discussions about whether rewarding has any point leaves their valuation of the mechanism itself unknown, but behaviorally they ignore it entirely.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThey receive reward from at least one other player but never publicly acknowledge it, never comment on it in chat, and never reciprocate via the reward mechanism. There is no sign of alliance‑building, targeted thanks, or attempts to preferentially treat prior rewarders. Their contributions remain uniformly high to everyone, independent of who rewarded them earlier. This suggests that interpersonal gratitude signaling, if present internally, does not translate into strategic reward use or explicit social bonding in this setting. Whether they even notice the identity of the rewarder is unknown, but their observable behavior is non‑reciprocal with respect to rewards.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey do not comment on, or react explicitly to, others’ contribution levels, payoffs, or reward expenditures, even when non‑contributors are named and criticized by other players, and even when some players visibly earn much more by free‑riding. They refrain from moralizing, blaming, or defending any side. Their own contribution choices also show no conditional response to these outcomes: they keep contributing fully regardless of deteriorating group behavior, payoff gaps, or perceived unfairness. They also do not praise or reward generous contributors. This combination suggests a relatively detached stance toward others’ specific outcomes, with a focus on maintaining their own cooperative standard rather than adapting to or policing others’. Emotional reactions to others’ gains and losses are unknown; the observable stance is quiet, steady, and non‑reactive."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a stable, unconditional cooperator in this environment. They always contribute the full endowment, even when others clearly free-ride, when peers explicitly advocate for non-contribution, and when it is the final round. They do not appear to condition their contributions on past group behavior or on immediate payoffs. Their behavior suggests a strong internal norm that “everyone should contribute” and a willingness to act on that norm regardless of short-term personal gain. They tolerate the risk of being exploited by free-riders and do not visibly adjust toward a more self-protective strategy, indicating either low sensitivity to exploitation, a strong preference for maintaining cooperation, or both. Their fairness norm centers on universal full contribution; they do not express support for retaliatory non-contribution, and they keep cooperating even as others explicitly coordinate to stop.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThey are proactive but succinct in communication. Early on, they initiate interaction and quickly move to a norm-setting attempt, explicitly promoting universal contribution. Throughout, their tone is calm, cooperative, and lightly humorous or understated rather than moralistic or hostile. They engage in simple coordination bids (“we should all contribute,” “let's all contribute”) and later offer a short, reflective comment about the spread of non-cooperation, framing it as “infectious” rather than attacking specific individuals. They respond to evolving group dynamics with brief remarks but do not dominate the chat, argue, or escalate conflict, even when others become insulting or cynical. They do not directly confront individual defectors nor join in calls to “get” or shame them. Overall they show a prosocial, group-oriented communication style with moderate engagement and low aggression.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThey demonstrate awareness that the game has a fixed, short horizon; they acknowledge statements about the total number of rounds and the final round. Despite clear end-game cues and explicit calls from others to stop contributing at the end, their strategy does not decay: they continue to contribute fully in the last rounds, including the very last one. They resist the typical end-game unraveling of cooperation and do not switch to self-interested free-riding even when it is strategically tempting and socially endorsed. There is no visible attempt to exploit remaining cooperators at the end, suggesting that their cooperative behavior is guided more by a stable principle or preference for mutual cooperation than by backward induction.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey never spend on rewards in any round, despite having opportunities and despite receiving rewards themselves. They also explicitly express skepticism about the usefulness of the reward mechanism, stating that they see little or no point in rewarding. This indicates that their decision not to reward is deliberate rather than inattentive. Their non-use of rewards persists even when cooperation is fragile and when reward could, in principle, be used to encourage others. They appear to view contribution itself—and verbal encouragement—as their main cooperative action, rather than using costly reward as a strategic tool. Their stance suggests they are cost-conscious about side mechanisms that do not clearly improve their own or the group’s outcomes, or they simply consider reward redundant or ineffective in this group context.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThey receive rewards from others but never reciprocate with reward spending. They do not explicitly acknowledge being rewarded in chat and do not build visible bilateral alliances with those who reward them. Their cooperative actions remain directed toward the whole group rather than selectively toward rewarders. This pattern suggests low responsiveness to reward as a relational or strategic signal: they continue full cooperation, but not in a way that differentially benefits those who rewarded them. Their primary reciprocity seems to be toward the group-level norm of contribution rather than toward individual benefactors.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey notice and comment selectively on others’ behaviors and implied outcomes. Early on, they focus on setting a cooperative norm rather than on calling out non-contributors by name, leaving that to other players. When one player heavily uses the reward mechanism in a seemingly extreme way, they respond with a mildly curious, lightly teasing question rather than condemnation or praise, indicating social awareness but emotional restraint. Later, as free-riding behavior spreads and one player reaps unusually high payoffs from non-contribution, they describe the pattern as “infectious,” framing it as a group dynamic problem rather than attacking particular individuals. They do not express envy or anger over payoff disparities, and they do not change their own strategy in response to these outcome patterns. Overall, they register others’ outcomes, comment in a low-key and sometimes humorous manner, but maintain their own cooperative course without retaliatory or compensatory moves."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a stable, unconditional full contributor. They always give their entire endowment to the public fund and do not reduce contributions in response to repeated and persistent free‑riding by another player or to cooperation decay by some others later in the game. Their behavior suggests they prioritize maximizing group welfare over their own short‑term material payoff, even when the marginal per‑coin return is lower than the private return and others are not fully cooperative. They explicitly express a belief that universal full contribution produces high payoffs for everyone and that contributing fully “still helps in the long run,” indicating an understanding of the payoff structure and a forward‑looking, efficiency‑oriented mindset. They do not display conditional cooperation or reciprocity in their contribution levels: their giving is insensitive to others’ deviations, including late‑game breakdowns. This pattern is consistent with a principled or norm‑driven cooperator rather than a payoff‑maximizing strategist. Their risk tolerance appears high with respect to exploitation: they continue to expose themselves to free‑riding without adjustment. Concerns about fairness are present in their comments about some “hurting everyone,” but these fairness concerns do not translate into any reduction in their own contribution, suggesting they treat contribution as a moral or fixed rule rather than a tool for enforcing fairness.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nTheir tone is friendly, upbeat, and lightly humorous, with some informal language and typos suggesting spontaneous rather than over‑calculated communication. They actively attempt to coordinate and persuade others toward universal cooperation, providing simple, outcome‑oriented arguments about how everyone benefits if all give fully. Early on, they try to explain the benefit magnitude, correcting their own earlier miscalculation, which indicates a desire to be accurate and transparent with others. They encourage others explicitly to keep contributing fully even when some players do not, framing it as beneficial “in the long run,” which reveals an effort to maintain group morale and a cooperative norm. They also speculate that some low contributors “might be bots,” which distances them somewhat from the defectors and aligns them socially with the high contributors. They engage readily with at least one other cooperative player, responding to comments, agreeing about preferences for sanctioning low contributors, and sharing a light “lol” exchange, indicating a sociable and affiliative style. They do not confront defectors directly or individually; instead, they speak to the group in general, using inclusive language (“everyone,” “y’all”) and thanking “everyone that’s giving all.” At the end, they thank all participants and mildly lament that some “not very nice folk” are present, which is a soft, non‑aggressive expression of disapproval. Overall, they are engaged, coordination‑oriented, and prosocial in tone, with a mild but not punitive moral stance.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThey show clear awareness that the game has a known, finite horizon; they explicitly reference the number of players and rounds and respond when another player notes that the game is “almost done.” Despite this awareness, they do not reduce contributions toward the end and continue to give fully in the final rounds, including when others’ cooperation temporarily collapses. There is no evidence of end‑game defection or even hedging; their contribution strategy remains fixed. They maintain a polite, appreciative tone up to the final round, then close with thanks and a brief negative comment about some participants’ behavior, suggesting emotional awareness of others’ choices but no strategic adjustment in response. Their behavior is consistent with an end‑game‑insensitive, rule‑following cooperator: they appear to treat “always give” as the correct strategy regardless of the remaining number of rounds. Any implicit frustration with defectors emerges only as verbal commentary, not as a behavioral shift in contributions or reward use.\n\n<REWARD>\nTheir use of the reward mechanism is limited and selective. They give rewards only in a couple of instances and never at high intensity. They do not appear to reward systematically in proportion to others’ contributions, nor do they use rewards regularly to build a clear alliance or to maintain cooperation levels. Instead, their occasional rewards seem to serve as sporadic positive reinforcement or recognition for cooperative behavior rather than as a calculated investment. They never use reward to retaliate or to strategically steer specific borderline contributors; they also do not appear to adjust their reward use over time in response to continued free‑riding. The overall pattern suggests that they conceptually support the idea of positive reinforcement but either find the cost structure unattractive, choose to conserve coins, or simply do not prioritize reward as a central tool. Their comments about wishing they could “take away points rather than give” indicate a latent interest in punitive mechanisms rather than costly positive rewards when others persistently defect, although they do not have access to punishment in this game. Thus, they are primarily a contributor, secondarily and weakly a rewarder, and conceptually open to punishment as a more satisfying or effective enforcement mechanism.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThey receive rewards in several rounds from others. There is no explicit, direct verbal gratitude directed at specific rewarders; they do not name them or acknowledge them individually in chat. Their high and stable contributions begin before any rewards arrive and continue regardless of whether they are rewarded, so their cooperative behavior is not contingent on receiving reward. They also do not clearly reciprocate by rewarding those who reward them; their own reward episodes are sparse and do not obviously map onto incoming rewards, so any reciprocity is at best weak or unknown. Socially, they maintain a friendly and cooperative interaction with at least one other cooperative player who also rewards them at times, which might reflect an implicit mutual‑support cluster, but this cannot be firmly established. Overall, when rewarded, they continue behaving as before—fully cooperative and generally positive—without visible strategic adjustment or explicit expressions of alliance building. Their response profile fits a norm‑driven cooperator who appreciates prosocial peers in general but does not strongly condition behavior on being rewarded and does not systematically engage in reward‑based reciprocity."

They always give the full endowment to the public fund and never experiment with lower contributions, even when others free-ride or cooperation temporarily collapses. Their behavior suggests a strong internal norm that “the right thing” is to contribute fully, relatively insensitive to immediate personal payoff. They show no evidence of conditional cooperation based on others’ exact contribution levels; instead, they maintain full cooperation through both cooperative and non-cooperative phases. They accept the risk that others might exploit their contributions and do not adjust in response to repeated low contributions from one group member or sudden drops from others. Fairness matters to them at an expressive level (they comment when others do not “play along”), but they do not translate fairness concerns into retaliatory contribution cuts. Overall, they behave as a principled cooperator with high risk tolerance for being exploited and low responsiveness of contributions to others’ behavior.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nTheir communication is brief, positive, and group-oriented. They endorse the cooperative plan early, signaling alignment with full contributions without pushing their own agenda. When others deviate, they acknowledge it with light humor rather than anger, indicating mild frustration but a desire to keep the atmosphere friendly. They explicitly express appreciation for cooperative teammates, reinforcing group cohesion verbally. They also joke about wanting to punish free riders, which shows they care about norm enforcement but keep the tone playful rather than hostile. They respond to others’ comments and build on them, rather than ignoring the chat, indicating engagement and social awareness. Near the end, they make a casual remark about the game nearly being over, which shows awareness of the horizon but no attempt to coordinate an end-game defection. Overall, their style is sociable, affiliative, and cooperative, using light humor and gratitude rather than pressure or moralizing.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThey show explicit awareness of the finite horizon but do not adjust their cooperative strategy as the end approaches. Contributions remain maximized through all phases, including after noticeable declines in group contributions and in the last few rounds. There is no evidence of end-game unraveling or strategic defection; they do not attempt to “cash out” in later rounds. Instead, they maintain the same cooperative pattern and a friendly tone about the game nearing completion. This suggests that their motivation is more norm-driven or identity-driven than strategically forward-looking in the standard economic sense; the impending end does not override their commitment to full cooperation. They appear more interested in sustaining a cooperative identity than in exploiting the final rounds.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey are willing to spend substantially on rewarding others, despite the fact that the reward technology is personally costly and inefficient. They do not use rewards early, even when cooperation is high, suggesting that they do not see small, ongoing rewards as necessary to sustain already-strong cooperation. Instead, their major reward outlays appear concentrated in situations where cooperative behavior becomes more fragile or where a subset of players continues to contribute highly while others shirk. This pattern suggests they use rewards as a way to recognize and support loyal cooperators when they are under strain, rather than as a continuous incentive scheme. They show no sign of using rewards tactically to curry favor for future material gain; they continue to fully cooperate regardless of being rewarded or not. Their reward behavior reflects expressive gratitude and norm support rather than payoff-maximizing strategy.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThey receive rewards on a few occasions but never comment explicitly about being rewarded, never name their benefactor, and do not verbally reciprocate. It is unknown whether they can identify exactly who rewarded them in each instance, but their silence suggests they do not treat the reward as the basis for an explicit alliance. Nevertheless, their overall rewarding behavior appears aligned with supporting high contributors generally, which likely includes those who rewarded them. Thus, any reciprocity is indirect and norm-based rather than personalized or negotiated. Being rewarded does not visibly alter their contribution pattern, which is already maximized, nor does it trigger a clear change in their reward spending trajectory. Their cooperation therefore seems robust to the presence or absence of personal recognition, with gratitude expressed more collectively (“appreciate y’all”) than individually."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a highly cooperative “steadfast contributor” with a single brief defection. They consistently give the full endowment to the public fund almost every round, indicating a strong preference for collective efficiency over short‑term private gain. Their pattern is extremely stable: they do not gradually decrease contributions in response to a persistent low contributor, and they do not condition their level on small variations in others’ behavior. They appear to treat full contribution as the baseline norm, rather than something contingent on strict fairness or equal treatment.\n\nThey do briefly switch to zero contribution once late in the game, then immediately return to full contributions. The most plausible interpretation is a one‑off test or opportunistic free ride rather than a full strategy shift: there is no sustained lowering or tit‑for‑tat pattern before or after. This suggests they understand that free riding can be profitable but still choose to cooperate almost all the time.\n\nGiven the public-good multiplier, full contribution is individually costly relative to free riding but socially efficient. Their willingness to keep contributing at the maximum despite chronic undercontribution by one peer shows tolerance for disadvantageous inequity and a low sensitivity to being exploited. They do not seem risk‑averse about others’ cooperation: they continue to bet on group contribution even when evidence of full unanimity is weak. They appear to implicitly endorse a fairness norm that “everyone should give all” but are willing to maintain that norm unilaterally rather than punishing or withdrawing when others fall short.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThis player does not send any chat messages. They neither respond to others’ attempts at coordination nor initiate talk about strategy, fairness, or reciprocity. This suggests a low‑engagement or observer communication style: they follow along behaviorally but do not participate verbally.\n\nTheir silence persists even when others explicitly address group norms, express frustration about low contributors, or make light social comments. They do not offer thanks when the group is appreciative, do not complain, and do not comment on end‑game or rewards. This makes them hard to read socially and suggests that their cooperative behavior is not driven by overt norm enforcement or reputation‑building through talk.\n\nThe lack of communication also means they do not try to persuade low contributors, coordinate end‑game tactics, or signal intentions. Any beliefs or strategies they hold are implemented purely through actions, not words. They appear comfortable letting others lead in norm‑setting while simply aligning (or not) through their contribution decisions.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThe player clearly perceives the finite horizon (the interface shows remaining rounds), and their behavior reflects some horizon awareness but with only a modest end‑game effect. For most of the game, including late rounds, they maintain full contributions. They do not exhibit the classic gradual decay of cooperation as the end approaches.\n\nThe single zero‑contribution move occurs relatively late, then is followed by a return to full contributions in subsequent rounds, including the final round. This indicates that any end‑game opportunism is weak and short‑lived rather than a planned unraveling. They do not escalate free riding as the last round comes into view, nor do they attempt a coordinated high‑cooperation “finish”; they simply revert to their prior cooperative pattern.\n\nOverall, they act as if sustaining a cooperative norm is valuable even near the end, and they do not strongly exploit the final rounds despite the absence of future interaction. Any learning or adaptation to others’ persistent undercontribution manifests minimally; they continue to “play their game” almost unchanged through to the end.\n\n<REWARD>\nThis player never spends anything on rewards, despite having repeated opportunities and clear examples of high cooperators they could reward. They do, however, receive rewards multiple times. The absence of outgoing rewards, even toward consistently generous others, suggests they do not use the reward mechanism as a tool for norm reinforcement or reciprocity.\n\nSeveral interpretations are consistent with the data and cannot be fully disentangled: they may view reward as too costly given its inefficiency; they may not see reward as necessary when others are already cooperating; or they may be generally uninterested in active sanctioning systems. What is clear is that their cooperative stance in contributions does not extend into costly positive sanctioning.\n\nTheir behavior therefore fits a “pure cooperator, non‑rewarder” pattern: they contribute highly but do not invest in incentivizing others. They rely on direct contribution choices, not metastrategic tools like rewards, to shape group outcomes.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThe player receives identifiable rewards from at least one cooperator but shows no observable behavioral or communicative response. They do not increase their contribution level afterward (it is already at ceiling), and they do not start rewarding in return. Their single deviation to zero contribution is not clearly linked to the timing of being rewarded, and they resume full cooperation regardless of reward flows. This indicates that their contribution strategy is effectively insensitive to being rewarded; they are already committed to high cooperation and do not adjust in response to positive reinforcement.\n\nThey also do not send chat messages acknowledging or thanking the rewarder, nor do they attempt to form an explicit alliance with high contributors. There is no targeted reciprocity via the reward channel. Their stance appears to be: continue contributing maximally because that is their chosen norm, independent of who rewards whom. In new environments with identifiable rewarders, this type is likely to appreciate rewards only passively (through payoff gains), without using them as a basis for coalition‑building or strategic behavioral shifts."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a steadfast high contributor who always gives the full endowment to the public fund. Their behavior is extremely stable and does not react to others’ deviations: they continue maximal contributions even when one peer persistently free rides and others occasionally reduce their own contributions. They appear to follow a cooperative norm based on “what is socially best” rather than on narrow payoff maximization, because the contribution pattern is strictly dominated given the MPCR and other players’ behavior. There is no evidence that they condition their own contribution on fairness, reciprocity, or punishment/reward prospects; their strategy is essentially unconditional full cooperation. Risk tolerance is high in the social sense: they are willing to expose themselves to exploitation and do not hedge by lowering contributions, even when cooperation in the group becomes weaker late in the game.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThe player communicates very sparsely and with low assertiveness. They briefly affirm the cooperative plan proposed by another player and otherwise mostly observe the ongoing conversation among others. They do not attempt to persuade, coordinate, or call out free riders, even when others complain or express frustration. The tone is neutral to mildly positive and non-confrontational. They show some minimal social engagement, acknowledging the cooperative norm, but avoid leading, arguing, or enforcing norms in chat. Overall, they present as agreeable, quiet, and conflict-avoidant, preferring to cooperate through actions rather than words.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThe player shows no visible end-game defection. Contributions remain fully cooperative through the final rounds, including after other players start lowering contributions substantially and as the remaining-round count becomes clearly small. There is no sign of horizon-based strategizing or attempt to “cash out” in late rounds by reducing contributions. Instead, they maintain their established cooperative pattern until the game ends. They also do not adjust their reward behavior in a clear, systematic way near the end; end-game awareness does not appear to alter their strategic stance.\n\n<REWARD>\nThe player is generally restrained in using rewards but is willing to spend heavily on them in a few instances. They do not reward in most rounds, despite stable high cooperation by several peers, which suggests that reward is not used as a routine reciprocity tool. However, when they do reward, they commit substantial resources, sacrificing a large fraction of their payoff to transfer positive payoffs to others even though the reward mechanism is efficiency-reducing. This indicates a willingness to incur significant personal cost to support or signal appreciation to cooperators, independent of strict payoff efficiency. The timing suggests that rewards are triggered by persistent cooperation in the face of free riding and by group-level strain on the cooperative norm, but exact internal criteria are unknown. Their rewards are more altruistic/expressive than strategically optimized, and there is no clear evidence they fine-tune reward amounts in response to minor contribution differences.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThe player does receive rewards in several rounds, but they do not change their contribution behavior afterward, since they are already at maximal contribution both before and after being rewarded. There is no observable shift toward systematically rewarding those who rewarded them, so direct reciprocal “you rewarded me, I reward you” behavior is unknown or at best low-confidence. They also do not verbally acknowledge being rewarded, so gratitude signaling in chat is absent. Their main form of “response” to rewarders is simply to continue fully cooperating, which is indistinguishable from their baseline strategy; thus, any internal sense of alliance or special favoritism toward rewarders remains unknown."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThe player is a stable, unconditional high contributor. They always invest the full endowment into the public good, with no observable sensitivity to others’ defection patterns or to the game’s remaining length. They do not appear to condition their contribution on recent under-provision by specific peers or on perceived unfairness in payoffs. This indicates a strong cooperative norm that overrides short-term self-interest and any inclination to match others’ lower contributions. Risk tolerance for being exploited by free-riders is high; they continue to fully cooperate even when one or more players repeatedly contribute nothing. There is no observable attempt to “discipline” defectors via reduced contributions; instead, they separate their cooperation decision from others’ behavior and from any strategic calculation about marginal returns at different stages of the game.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThe player does not use the chat function at all (or such messages are absent from the transcript), so their explicit communication style is unknown. They neither affirm others’ cooperation proposals nor publicly protest defection or reward patterns. This silence suggests either a preference for nonverbal signaling through actions (contributions and rewards) or low engagement with social coordination via chat. They do not correct others’ misattributions or confusion, even when other players reference them or mix up names, implying low concern for managing others’ perceptions via words or a passive stance in group discourse.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThere is no visible end-game defection or tapering of cooperation. The player continues to contribute fully through the final rounds with no apparent adjustment as the horizon approaches, despite knowing the total number of rounds. Their reward behavior also does not converge to a clear “last-round” shutdown; instead, they sometimes continue to spend on rewards near the end and sometimes refrain, consistent with their earlier pattern of variable but recurring reward use. This suggests that they do not adopt a backward-induction logic or a classic end-game “grab” strategy. Their cooperative and rewarding tendencies appear driven more by a stable internal norm or preference than by forward-looking, horizon-sensitive optimization.\n\n<REWARD>\nThe player is generally willing to spend on rewards, often at nontrivial personal cost, but not in every round and not in a mechanically consistent way. They are more likely to reward when all or most others contribute fully and less likely to reward in mixed-contribution environments where some defect. They rarely, if ever, reward noncontributors; observed rewards tend to go to peers who are cooperating. This indicates that they use rewards as positive reinforcement for cooperative behavior, aligning with a prosocial norm-reinforcement strategy. At times they allocate rewards widely across multiple cooperators, and at other times they reward more selectively or not at all, suggesting some fluctuation in motivation, attention, or perceived need for reinforcement rather than a fixed rule like “always reward all cooperators.” They are willing to incur substantial cumulative cost on rewards across the game, implying that they place value on expressing approval or fostering group cooperation even when the direct payoff return is neutral under this reward technology.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThe player is repeatedly the recipient of rewards from others, but their behavioral response is not tightly reciprocal in a dyadic or tit-for-tat sense. They do not systematically channel more rewards back to those who reward them, nor do they clearly form an exclusive “reward alliance” with any single partner. Instead, their pattern suggests generalized reciprocity or group-level gratitude: when they do reward, they usually direct it toward cooperators broadly rather than purely to prior reward-givers. There is no evidence of retaliating against, ignoring, or favoring specific individuals strictly based on prior reward history. Their continued full contribution regardless of who rewards them also indicates that they do not condition basic cooperation on being rewarded.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThe player consistently observes detailed information about others’ contributions, payoffs, and reward expenditures, yet does not visibly adjust core cooperation in response. They tolerate others earning higher payoffs (especially high-earning defectors or low spenders on rewards) without reducing their own contribution level. This shows low reactivity to inequity in terms of contribution-return ratios. Their reward allocations, however, do appear loosely sensitive to others’ choices: they more readily reward those who both contribute and are not obviously shirking, and they do not systematically “top up” disadvantaged but cooperative players versus advantaged ones—status equalization is not clearly their objective. They do not use rewards to “punish” via omission in a strong, consistent way, but free-riders tend to be left without positive reinforcement when the player is spending, which can act as a mild social signal. Overall, they respond to others’ outcomes more by quietly adjusting where they send positive signals than by altering their own contribution or engaging in overt sanctioning.\n\n"

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a strong, almost rigid high contributor who repeatedly gives the full endowment to the public good in most rounds. Their default norm is “always cooperate fully” rather than “match the group” or “best respond to incentives,” even though the marginal per-capita return is low. They do not appear to optimize for personal payoff; they continue to contribute the maximum even after repeated net losses and repeated punishment from others.\n\nTheir contributions are highly stable for most of the game, with only two clear deviations: a single mid/late-game round and the final round in which they switch to zero contribution. These exceptions are sharp departures from their usual pattern, not gradual decay. This suggests that their baseline rule is categorical (“I give everything”) and that non-contribution is an exceptional, reactive move, not a fine-tuned response to changing averages.\n\nThey do not visibly condition their contributions on others’ average behavior. Average contributions around them fluctuate, and low contributors are present throughout, but this does not lead them to downshift toward the group’s mean. Instead, their cooperative standard is self-imposed and relatively independent of others’ choices. This points to a strong internal fairness or moral norm (“I should contribute fully”) rather than reciprocal tit-for-tat reasoning.\n\nRisk tolerance is high: they consistently expose themselves to exploitation and to punishment risk by being visibly more cooperative than many peers, and they do not hedge by partial contributions. They behave more like an unconditional cooperator with occasional protest/non-cooperation episodes than a cautious or strategic cooperator.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nAwareness of the finite horizon is present but does not drive gradual cooperation decay. For most of the game, including the late-middle phase, they maintain full contributions. There is no smooth end-game unraveling pattern; instead, the response near the horizon is punctuated and reactive.\n\nTwo elements characterize their end-game behavior:\n\n1. **Late reactive defection:** After a long history of full cooperation and substantial use of punishment, they briefly switch to non-contribution once before the final round. This is not aligned with a pure backward-induction logic (which would reduce contributions progressively), but it fits with an emotional/retaliatory or “testing” response to perceived unfairness and hostility (notably, they are repeatedly punished while being a strong contributor).\n\n2. **Final-round withdrawal:** In the last round, they again choose zero contribution. This aligns with a simple heuristic such as “since this is the last chance, and others have not treated me fairly, I no longer owe cooperation.” The fact that they return to full contribution after a prior zero, but drop to zero again only at the very end, suggests they do not fully abandon cooperative identity mid-game; rather, they compartmentalize: “cooperate by default, except in special protest moments and at the true end.”\n\nThere is no evidence they seek to exploit others in the end-game; zero contributions appear tied more to frustration, perceived injustice, or payoff repair than to calculated free-riding on a predictable terminal defection by the group. Their end-game pattern is best described as norm-driven cooperation with late, abrupt exceptions tied to accumulated grievances and the horizon, not as sophisticated horizon-based optimization.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey are willing to use costly punishment and escalate it over time, even when it reduces their own payoffs substantially. Early on, they use punishment sparingly and at low intensity; later, they significantly increase total punishment expenditure. This progression is consistent with growing frustration rather than a pre-planned enforcement schedule.\n\nGiven their consistently high own contributions, the most plausible punishment trigger is norm enforcement against perceived free riders or inconsistent contributors. Their pattern suggests they likely target players who contribute very little or who reduce contributions sharply. Because they themselves are punished multiple times despite high contributions, their later punishment spikes may also incorporate an element of retaliation or generalized anger at the group (“antisocial punishment of antisocial punishers”), though who they target is unknown.\n\nThey are not purely efficiency-oriented: in this environment, punishment is relatively potent but still costly. Their heavy use of it, especially later, indicates they prioritize expressing disapproval and enforcing a cooperative norm over maximizing their own monetary outcome. Deterrence is a plausible motive — trying to discipline chronic low contributors — but the scale and timing of later sanctions (when many rounds have already passed and gains from future cooperation are limited) suggests that emotional or justice-oriented motives are at least as important as instrumental ones.\n\nThey are selective in the sense that they do not punish in every opportunity, and they abstain from punishment in many rounds while still being exploited and punished themselves. This indicates some threshold or internal rule (“tolerate noise, but punish when behavior crosses a line”); the precise trigger is unknown, but it is unlikely to be random, given the sparse early punishment and heavier late use. Overall, they function as a principled, high-cost norm enforcer who becomes increasingly punitive when the group’s behavior violates their cooperative expectations and when they personally experience unfair punishment."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a stable, unconditional high contributor. They always give the full endowment, with no variation, regardless of others’ behavior, fluctuations in group contributions, or aggressive punishment dynamics in the group. They do not appear to condition their contributions on others’ past choices, on being rewarded, or on the presence of chronic low contributors. This indicates a strong internal cooperation norm that does not update with experience, rather than a calculated best response to the environment. They tolerate being among the highest contributors without attempting to free-ride or “balance” fairness ex post. Risk tolerance is high in the sense of consistently foregoing safe private payoffs to fund the public good, even when others free-ride or when payoff volatility (from punishment) is high. Their fairness norm is contribution-focused: they keep their own behavior cooperative but do not actively enforce equal contributions on others.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThere is no end-game decay in cooperation: the player maintains full contributions through to the final round, including when at least one peer sharply reduces contribution at the very end. They do not appear to switch to selfish play even when the horizon is very short and reputational or future-return motives are minimized. Their strategy is time-invariant; either they do not put weight on backward induction logic, or they prioritize a fixed cooperative principle over payoff-maximizing end-game adjustment. They also do not ramp up or change use of reward or punishment as the end approaches; sanction behavior stays minimal and sporadic, suggesting limited strategic horizon-based planning overall.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThe player never uses punishment, despite multiple opportunities and clear evidence of persistent low contributors and disruptive actors. They refrain from punishing both clear under-contributors and potential norm violators, even when punishment by others is frequent and severe. This indicates a strong reluctance to engage in costly harm, even when it could be economically effective and socially supported. Their motive structure appears non-retaliatory and non-deterrent: they do not use punishment to discipline, to even scores, or to respond to personal disadvantage. This is consistent with a prosocial but non-enforcing “cooperative pacifist” type: willing to contribute heavily to the common good but unwilling to incur costs to inflict losses on others, regardless of group norms or efficiency arguments.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nThe player is never punished in this game; thus there is no direct evidence of how they respond to identifiable punishers. Their standing as a consistent full contributor makes them an unlikely target for norm-enforcing punishment, and indeed no one directs punishment at them. As a result, their tendencies regarding forgiveness, retaliation, or conforming in response to being punished are unknown. Given their general avoidance of punishment toward others, a cautious inference (low confidence) is that they may be disinclined to retaliate even if punished, but this is not behaviorally tested here.\n\n<REWARD>\nThe player uses reward sparingly but deliberately. They reward only a few times across the game and always choose clear high contributors or especially cooperative peers. They never reward low or erratic contributors, even when those players are heavily targeted by others. Reward choices suggest an attempt to positively reinforce strong cooperation, possibly to acknowledge consistent contributors or to encourage an emerging cooperative cluster. However, they do not escalate into systematic “bonus” payments or broad mutual-reward cycles; they remain highly selective and low-intensity in reward use. This pattern is consistent with a frugal prosocial type: willing to spend a little to reinforce good behavior but not to run an expensive reward regime. There is no sign they use reward tactically to buy allies or to offset others’ punishment; the targets are already prosocial by contribution behavior.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThe player receives rewards from others on several occasions and continues to contribute fully before and after being rewarded. They do not appear to change their sanction behavior—neither to reciprocally reward their benefactors nor to form a visible “reward club.” They also do not start punishing on behalf of those who reward them. Their contribution pattern is already maximally cooperative, so there is no upward shift to observe; the main effect is that their behavior remains unchanged. This suggests that their cooperation is driven more by internal norms or stable preferences than by direct reciprocity to specific rewarders. Any reciprocity or alliance-building motive, if present, is subtle or overshadowed by their fixed strategy; explicit reciprocal reward to particular individuals is not clearly expressed.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThe player shows awareness of others’ outcomes (since they see all payoffs and sanction flows) but does not visibly react in their own strategy. They observe repeated, sometimes harsh punishment patterns, including concentrated punishment of certain low contributors and extensive sanction spending by some high contributors. Despite this, they neither join in punishment nor adjust contributions in response to changing payoff landscapes, inequities, or the emergence of punitive “enforcers.” Likewise, when some peers suffer large net losses or negative payoffs from being heavily punished, the player does not step in to counterbalance with rewards. Their behavior indicates a separation between their own prosocial norm (always contribute fully, occasionally reward cooperative peers) and the broader payoff dynamics. They seem indifferent, in strategic terms, to others’ exact payoffs, focusing instead on sustaining their own cooperative pattern and occasionally signaling approval of high contributors, without engaging in payoff-level correction or coalition behavior. Overall, they are a principled, non-interventionist cooperator who watches but does not strategically exploit or repair the sanction structure around them."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a **stable, unconditional high contributor**. They always commit their full endowment to the public good, regardless of how others behave or how average contributions move over time. Their pattern suggests a strong internal norm of full cooperation rather than a responsive, conditional strategy. They do not appear to reduce contributions in response to free‑riding, moderate giving, or declining group averages. They accept the risk that others may contribute much less and still persist with maximal contributions, indicating low sensitivity to exploitation in their contribution choice and a willingness to prioritize group efficiency over personal short‑term payoff. Their fairness norm centers on “everyone should give as much as possible,” but they express this norm through punishment choices, not by adjusting their own contribution. This looks more like **norm‑driven idealism** than payoff‑maximizing caution.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThis player is a **targeted, norm‑enforcing punisher** who is willing to incur substantial personal cost to sanction perceived under‑contributors. They do not punish randomly or widely; punishment appears focused on those contributing markedly less than the group, especially very low or minimal contributors. Their use of punishment increases when low contributions become more pronounced, and they are willing to spend multiple punishment units against the same low contributor in different situations, consistent with an intent to deter persistent free‑riding rather than to make symbolic statements. They do not retaliate: they never experience deductions themselves, yet they also do not direct punishment in ways that look like responses to being personally targeted. There is no evidence they punish generous or average contributors, so anti‑social punishment is unlikely. Overall, they act as a **moralistic enforcer**: they fully cooperate and then selectively sanction those who fall furthest below what they appear to regard as an acceptable contribution level. Their willingness to bear nontrivial punishment costs suggests they value sustaining cooperation norms and penalizing exploitation more than maximizing short‑run income.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThis player tracks others’ contribution levels and punishment outcomes and uses that information to shape whom they sanction, but not how much they themselves contribute. They appear responsive primarily to **contribution gaps**, not to others’ payoffs per se: high earners who also contribute fully are left untouched, while relatively high payoffs combined with low contributions tend to attract punishment. When others already receive substantial deductions for low contributions, the player sometimes refrains from adding more, suggesting an awareness of cumulative sanctions and some restraint rather than purely spiteful behavior (confidence moderate, as identities of punishers are unknown). They do not seem to reward or protect any particular subset of players, and there is no clear evidence of coalition‑building or favoritism; their pattern is more impersonal and rule‑based. Changes in the group’s aggregate contribution level and the emergence of repeated low contributors elicit adjustments in their punishment spending but not in their cooperative stance. Overall, they behave like a **principled cooperators’ guardian**: they remain fully generous while using punishment as a calibrated tool to push the group toward the high‑contribution norm they themselves uphold."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a strict, unconditional full cooperator within the available action set. They consistently allocate their entire endowment to the public good in every situation, regardless of prior payoffs, group contribution levels, or punishment received. Their behavior indicates that they prioritize maximizing group efficiency over individual material payoff, even when others free-ride and even when they are personally targeted with punishment. There is no sign of strategic withholding, experimentation, or contingent cooperation; they do not appear to condition their contributions on observed past behavior of specific peers or the group average.\n\nThey follow a strong fairness norm defined as “everyone should contribute fully,” but they do not enforce that norm through changing their own cooperative level. Instead, they separate contribution decisions (always full) from sanctioning decisions (handled through punishment). This pattern suggests a principled or rule-based cooperative style rather than payoff-driven risk management. Their risk tolerance regarding exploitation is high: they accept being repeatedly paired with low contributors without reducing their own contributions.\n\nBecause contributions are binary, it is unknown how they would behave if partial contributions were allowed, but the absence of any deviation from full contribution even under persistent free-riding and personal cost suggests that, given similar structures, they tends toward maximal contribution as a default rule.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThis player shows no end-game decay in cooperation. They continue to contribute fully through the final stage and do not shift toward self-serving behavior as the horizon approaches. Even when cooperation from others fluctuates in earlier and middle stages, they maintain the same cooperative rule to the very end.\n\nTheir pattern indicates that awareness of the finite horizon does not substantially alter their core strategy. They do not appear to implement backward induction or “last-round defection.” Instead, they exhibit a stable, time-invariant cooperative rule that persists regardless of how many rounds remain. When the group becomes highly cooperative at the end, they align with it but only by continuing the same full contribution they already use, not by changing behavior in response to the horizon itself.\n\nOverall, their response to the end of the game suggests that they either (a) do not prioritize strategic exploitation of the final rounds, or (b) consciously reject that logic in favor of maintaining a consistent cooperative identity.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThis player is a frequent and often heavy user of costly punishment. They repeatedly spend a substantial share of their earnings to sanction others, even when this leads to low personal payoffs. Their punishment activity is present both when they have been punished themselves and when they have not, so retaliation for being targeted is not the sole driver; however, the existence of prior punishment against them does not deter them from punishing.\n\nThe main apparent trigger for their sanctions is non-cooperation or under-contribution by others. When group contributions are high and nearly everyone cooperates, they still sometimes punish, but at lower intensity and only when at least one identifiable peer deviates from full contribution. When the environment contains several low contributors, their punishment becomes more intensive and costly, suggesting a strong punitive response to perceived free-riding. They behave like an enforcer of a high-contribution norm and are willing to incur large personal costs to impose losses on defectors.\n\nTheir punishment is selective rather than random: there is no evidence that they punish in uniformly high-cooperation environments where all visible players comply with the implicit contribution norm; in those cases, punishment use drops or disappears. This points to a norm-enforcing motive rather than pure spite or noise. At the same time, the amounts they spend are sometimes so large relative to their earnings that pure deterrence does not fully explain the behavior; they appear to experience intrinsic value or moral satisfaction from sanctioning free-riding, even if it is not instrumentally efficient.\n\nThey do not escalate punishment in response to being personally punished in a way that obviously targets specific individuals, because they cannot identify who punished them. Instead, they continue to apply sanctions broadly toward low contributors. This suggests that their punishment is less about personal vendetta and more about maintaining a cooperation standard at the group level, even under anonymity.\n\nOverall, this player functions as a strong, principled cooperator–punisher type: they uphold full cooperation themselves, and they are willing to sacrifice considerable resources to punish those who do not, without softening this stance over time or in response to end-game incentives."

They always contribute the full endowment, with no experimentation, no reaction to fluctuations in group behavior, and no visible adjustment to being punished. Their cooperation is stable and rigid rather than strategic: they do not reduce contributions even when many others free‑ride or when overall group contributions are low. This suggests they either prioritize the social-optimal outcome or adhere to a strong internal norm that “one should always contribute,” even when the immediate incentive points the other way. They appear tolerant of exploitation in contribution decisions themselves: they do not use their own contribution as leverage to discipline low contributors, instead separating cooperation from enforcement. Risk tolerance in contribution is high: they consistently expose themselves to being the “sucker” who contributes while others do not, and they do not hedge by ever keeping their endowment. Their fairness norm is asymmetric: they demand fairness via punishment, but they never withdraw their own cooperative effort to protect themselves from unfairness. There is no evidence of conditional cooperation based on observed averages; their behavior fits a “moralist cooperator” or “principled cooperator” profile whose contributions are rule-driven rather than payoff-optimizing.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nAwareness of the horizon does not change their cooperative stance: they continue full contributions through the final rounds with no end-game defection.

Punishment usage in late rounds fluctuates but does not escalate simply because the game is ending; there is no clear pattern of “last-round revenge” or opportunistic exploitation. Their strategy appears time-invariant: they do not relax norms near the end and do not exploit the group even when future retaliation is impossible. This suggests they treat each round as a separate moral or rule-based decision rather than as part of a backward-induction logic. Any beliefs about others’ horizon reasoning are unknown, but they act as if cooperation should be maintained to the end regardless of others’ likely defection. Overall, they show end-game norm persistence rather than strategic tapering.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThis player is a willing and recurrent punisher, often spending a substantial share of their payoff to impose costs on others. They sometimes punish heavily and at other times abstain, indicating situational selectivity rather than constant aggression. The most plausible trigger is low or zero contribution relative to the apparent group norm: they repeatedly face environments with clear free-riders, and their punishment spending tends to coincide with such environments. There is no evidence they ever punish high contributors, so antisocial punishment is not clearly supported (though not entirely ruled out; target-level data is unknown). Their punishment appears norm-enforcing and deterrence-oriented: they sacrifice their own earnings consistently to discipline others, even when it costs them a large portion of that round’s payoff and even when they themselves have been punished. They do not respond to receiving punishment by retaliating through lower contributions, and whether they directly counter-punish is unknown because identities of punishers are hidden. Their pattern is consistent with a “strong reciprocator” who cooperates fully and uses costly, sometimes intense punishment to push the group toward higher contribution. They do not refine their use of punishment over time in an obviously payoff-maximizing way; instead, its use remains principled and sometimes expensive, indicating a strong preference for enforcing cooperation norms over maximizing personal profit."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a stable, unconditional high contributor who consistently gives the full endowment to the public good every round. Their behavior does not adjust to variation in others’ average contributions, nor to shifts in specific peers’ behavior. They appear to hold a strong fairness or efficiency norm favoring maximal group contribution and are willing to uphold that norm regardless of apparent free-riding by specific players. There is no observable risk aversion in their contribution decisions; they accept the risk of being exploited by lower contributors without reducing their own input. Their contribution pattern suggests a principled or rule-based cooperator rather than a cautious, conditional cooperator.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThere is no observable end-game decay in cooperation: the player maintains maximal contribution through to the final round, despite knowing the horizon and seeing continued free-riding by some others. Instead of withdrawing cooperation near the end, they escalate punitive actions against low contributors. This indicates awareness of the game’s end (they see remaining rounds and radically intensify punishment in the last rounds) but a choice to use the end-game mainly to enforce or express norms rather than to defect for short-term gain. Their strategy in the final stage appears expressive or norm-enforcing, not purely payoff-maximizing.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThe player is highly willing to punish and targets those they perceive as persistent low contributors. They direct punishment selectively toward the most obvious free-rider and toward a moderate under-contributor whose behavior deviates from the near-full-contribution majority. They do not punish high contributors. Over time, their punishment escalates in intensity and frequency toward the same targets, indicating that repeated norm violations are a strong trigger. They continue to punish even when low contributors do not adjust upward, suggesting that their motive likely includes moralistic or expressive punishment rather than purely instrumental deterrence. They repeatedly bear substantial personal cost to impose very large deductions on low contributors, even when cooperation is already high among others and even when it is late in the game. This pattern suggests a strong inequity-averse or justice-enforcing tendency and a willingness to sacrifice own payoff to sanction behavior they deem unfair.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nUnknown. The transcript provides no instance of this player being punished, so their reactions to being sanctioned—whether retaliatory, compliant, or forgiving—cannot be inferred.\n\n<REWARD>\nThe player never uses the reward option despite repeatedly observing high contributions by most group members. They decline to reward those who consistently match their full contribution, and they do not reciprocate when others reward them on rare occasions. Given that they do use punishment extensively, this asymmetry suggests a strong preference for negative over positive enforcement. It may reflect a view that high contributions are expected baseline behavior and do not merit costly reinforcement, whereas deviation below that norm merits active sanction. It may also indicate sensitivity to the relatively poor cost-effectiveness of the reward technology compared to punishment, though this is inferred with low confidence. Overall, they are a zero-reward, punishment-focused enforcer.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThe player receives small positive transfers from others but does not alter their contribution level or begin rewarding in response. There is no observable reciprocation toward those who reward them, and no shift away from punishing low contributors. This suggests that gratitude-based reciprocity, alliance building, or strategic “thanking” do not play a meaningful role in their behavior within this game. They appear largely unmoved by positive social signals in their strategic choices.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThe player appears attentive to others’ contribution patterns and to the distribution of punishment. Their choice of targets aligns with persistent under-contributors, and they do not spread punishment broadly, indicating that they track who is relatively unfair rather than responding randomly or purely emotionally to outcomes. They do not copy other players’ strong use of punishment against cooperators; instead, they keep sanctioning focused on free-riders and under-contributors, which suggests independent judgment and a clear internal standard. They do not react to others’ high payoffs by imposing envy-driven punishment on high earners; instead, they tolerate high payoffs when they arise from high contributions. The player also does not seem to modulate their own contribution or sanctioning in response to others’ heavy use of punishment overall; they maintain full cooperation and intensify their own targeted sanctions against low contributors even as the environment grows more punitive. This points to a relatively stable, norm-driven persona: a strict, high-cooperation, punishment-heavy enforcer who prioritizes contribution fairness over personal earnings and does not rely on rewards or reciprocal favors to shape behavior."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a stable, unconditional full cooperator. They always contribute their entire endowment, without adjusting to variations in others’ contributions or to shifting punishment patterns around them. Their behavior suggests a strong fairness or efficiency norm: the public project is treated as the default rightful destination of all available resources, regardless of personal payoff consequences. They do not appear risk‑averse in the narrow monetary sense; they accept systematically lower individual payoffs than they could obtain by contributing less, even when free riding is persistent and heavily sanctioned. There is no evidence that they condition their contribution on others’ past behavior, nor that they strategically reduce contributions in response to exploitation or to end‑game proximity. Their cooperative stance appears principled rather than instrumentally optimized.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nAwareness of the finite horizon does not reduce their cooperation; they maintain maximal contributions through to the final round. Rather than displaying standard end‑game decay, they escalate costly punishment of low contributors at the very end, indicating that the horizon either does not weaken their norm enforcement motives or even strengthens a desire to “settle accounts.” They do not appear to be optimizing final‑round monetary payoff; instead, they prioritize enforcing contribution norms and expressing disapproval of free riding when there is no future opportunity for behavioral change. This points to a type that is relatively insensitive to future‑oriented strategic incentives and more driven by deontological or expressive motives.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey are a frequent and heavy punisher, willing to spend large amounts of their own payoff to impose large deductions on specific targets. Punishment is strongly contribution‑based and asymmetric: they consistently sanction the pure free rider and, to a lesser but still substantial extent, a persistent low contributor who gives below the prevailing cooperative standard. They do not punish high contributors or average‑to‑high cooperators, even when those players also punish others, which suggests their punishment is not retaliatory but norm‑enforcing. They show selectivity: only distinct under‑contributors are targeted, with intensity roughly tracking deviation from what appears to be their internal “full or near‑full contribution” standard. Over time, despite under‑contributors not clearly changing their pattern in a sustained way, they continue—and at the end increase—the intensity of sanctions, which indicates that deterrence is not their sole motive. Punishment also serves an expressive or retributive function: they act to equalize or morally rebalance outcomes even when it is inefficient and when learning opportunities for others are nearly over. They never use “mild” punishment as a calibrated signal; instead, they readily escalate to high levels, especially against a habitual free rider, signaling low tolerance for norm violations and a willingness to incur high cost for enforcement.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nNo one ever punishes this player, so their direct response to being punished is unknown. Because punishers are identifiable and they consistently refrain from punishing other high contributors—even those who themselves punish others—it is plausible (but uncertain) that they would not engage in retaliatory punishment simply for being sanctioned; their pattern is focused on contribution levels rather than on who punishes whom. However, this remains speculative; actual behavior under personal sanction is not observed.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey never reward anyone, despite the presence of consistently high contributors who match their cooperative effort. This is not because they lack opportunities or candidates; instead, the pattern indicates a strong asymmetry between punishment and reward. They appear to assign primary responsibility for maintaining cooperation to negative sanctions rather than positive reinforcement. The relatively low “leverage” of rewards compared to punishment may contribute to this choice, but they also ignore opportunities to provide even symbolic or low‑cost rewards. This suggests that they are a “pure punishing cooperator”: they cooperate fully and enforce cooperation through costly punishment, but do not use or apparently value material gratitude or positive reciprocity tools within the game.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThey are never rewarded, so their behavioral response to receiving identifiable rewards is unknown. There is no evidence on whether they would reciprocate rewards, form alliances, or shift punishment/reward strategies in response to being positively recognized.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey pay close attention to others’ contributions and adjust punishment targets accordingly, but they do not soften sanctions based on how badly targets have already been punished by others. Even when a low contributor is already incurring large deductions and ending rounds with very low or negative net payoffs, this player continues or escalates sanctions rather than moderating them. This indicates relatively low concern for the marginal suffering or disadvantage of under‑contributors once they are categorized as norm violators. Conversely, they show implicit solidarity with high contributors: they never punish them despite the fact that these players sometimes incur costs to punish others. They do not mirror others’ punishment patterns; instead, they maintain their own enforcement rule centered on contribution levels. Overall, they track outcomes mainly as a means to identify and repeatedly target free riders and under‑contributors, not to equalize everyone’s final payoffs or to coordinate with other punishers."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a stable, unconditional high contributor. They always contribute the full endowment, regardless of others’ past or current behavior, even when surrounded by persistent free-riding or low contribution from specific individuals and even at the very end of the game. This suggests a strong internal norm for full cooperation that is not contingent on immediate reciprocity. They appear comfortable accepting personal payoff losses from this stance, prioritizing the social optimum and norm consistency over short-term individual gain. Risk tolerance for being exploited is high; they do not reduce contributions in response to visible non-cooperation, instead relying on punishment rather than contribution adjustment to manage norm violations. Fairness, in their contribution choices, is defined as “everyone should contribute maximally” rather than proportionally to others’ actual behavior.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThere is no observable end-game decay in their cooperation: they continue to contribute fully in the final round, despite knowing the game is about to end and despite persistent low contributions by certain players. At the same time, they escalate punitive intensity against chronic low contributors toward the end, even when monetary deterrence value is minimal due to the short remaining horizon. This pattern indicates horizon awareness but a priority on enforcing norms and expressing disapproval over maximizing final monetary payoff. Their end-game response is characterized by stable cooperation plus intensified norm enforcement, not by strategic defection.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey are a frequent, heavy, and targeted punisher. They consistently direct punishment toward those contributing substantially below their own full-contribution norm, with particular focus on chronic or extreme free-riders. They also punish repeated moderate under-contribution, treating it as a meaningful violation even when the rest of the group mostly cooperates. The size of sanctions is often large, sometimes very costly to themselves, which suggests strong willingness to incur personal cost to discipline perceived defectors. Their punishment appears primarily norm-enforcing and deterrent, not retaliatory: they do not target high contributors, and there is no evidence they punish in response to being personally punished (they are never punished). They also never use reward, despite having the option, indicating that their cooperative norm is enforced mainly through negative sanctions rather than positive reinforcement. Their punishment selectivity is high—only those below a high contribution benchmark are targeted—but within that target set they are willing to escalate sharply, including at the very end of the game when future behavioral change is unlikely. This pattern is consistent with strong negative reciprocity and a preference for “moralistic” enforcement, where wrongdoers should suffer even if it does not improve future outcomes.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nUnknown. In this interaction, no one ever punishes them, so there is no behavioral evidence on how they respond to being sanctioned, whether they would retaliate, comply by increasing contributions, or forgive.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey never reward any other player, even when others contribute fully and even when some players spend substantial amounts punishing defectors in a way that aligns with their own norm. This absence persists throughout, despite many opportunities to provide positive reinforcement. Given this, their cooperative enforcement style is one-sidedly punitive rather than balanced between reward and punishment. Their unwillingness to reward may partly reflect the low efficiency of the reward mechanism relative to punishment, but they do not appear to use reward even strategically to build alliances or encourage already-cooperative behavior. For this player, good behavior seems expected and not something that merits extra payoff; only deviations provoke costly action.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThey are rewarded occasionally by others but do not reciprocate with rewards or alter contribution behavior in response. Since they are already at maximum contribution throughout, there is no upward behavioral shift possible, but they also do not reciprocate with reward to those who rewarded them. This indicates that being rewarded does not change their enforcement strategy; they remain purely punitive and do not transition into a mutual-reward or alliance-building mode. Their reaction to being rewarded is behaviorally neutral: they maintain full cooperation and continue to focus exclusively on punishing under-contributors.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey pay close attention to others’ contribution levels and outcomes and seem especially responsive to persistent low contributions irrespective of the punished players’ final payoffs. They are willing to impose punishment that drives some players’ payoffs extremely low or negative, indicating low concern for the punished players’ welfare once they are classified as defectors. There is no evidence they soften sanctions when others have already been heavily punished by third parties in the same round; they add their own punishment on top, suggesting they value norm expression and personal enforcement over efficiency or proportionality to total sanctions received. Conversely, they ignore opportunities to reward high-contributing players or heavy punishers, showing little interest in compensating for others’ sanction costs or evening out final payoffs among cooperators. Overall, they respond to others’ outcomes primarily through the lens of norm compliance: low contributors are aggressively sanctioned regardless of how hard others also hit them; high contributors and punishers of defectors are left to enjoy or bear their outcomes without further intervention."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a consistently above-average cooperator who mixes moderate and high contributions with occasional small downward adjustments. They rarely free-ride and never choose the minimum; their typical choice lies somewhat above the group mean. They appear guided by a fairness norm that expects roughly mid-to-high contributions from everyone and treats very low contributors as norm violators. Their contribution level is relatively stable over time, with minor fluctuations that do not show sharp decay, even after being targeted by punishment. They do not strongly condition their contributions on short-term personal payoff changes; instead, they maintain a cooperative baseline and tweak around it. Risk tolerance appears moderate: they are willing to fully cooperate at times even after being punished, suggesting they accept short-term vulnerability to sustain the public good, but they also occasionally lower their contribution, indicating some sensitivity to being exploited.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThey show no substantial end-game collapse in contributions. Even in the final rounds, they maintain moderate contributions rather than dropping to zero or to clear free-riding levels. They continue to use punishment actively in the final round, including toward a sudden low contributor, indicating that they remain norm-enforcing rather than switching to purely self-maximizing play. Horizon awareness is present in that their pattern of targeting appears refined and consistent by the late game, but they do not relax their standards or “cash out” in contribution or in sanctioning. This suggests a type that treats norm enforcement and cooperation as intrinsic or habit-like, not something to abandon once future interaction is limited.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey are a heavy and systematic punisher who focuses almost exclusively on low contributors and clear deviations from their internal standard. They use punishment frequently and at nontrivial personal cost, often targeting the same low-contribution individuals across multiple rounds. They also punish occasional moderate deviations when these are notably below the emerging group norm or below what they themselves give. High contributors are never punished by them, and they do not appear to use punishment competitively or retaliatorily; their targets are consistently those who contribute clearly less than the majority. This pattern aligns with strong altruistic norm enforcement: they bear significant costs to reduce the payoffs of under-contributors and to signal a minimum acceptable cooperation level. They do not appear to use punishment strategically to influence rewards or to form coalitions; it is primarily corrective and deterrent, aimed at enforcing a fairness norm on contributions.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nWhen they are punished, they show no evidence of retaliation, even when the punishment costs them and the punisher is identifiable. Their subsequent behavior does not include counter-punishing those who punished them, nor do they reduce their contributions in a clear act of defiance. Instead, they either maintain or even raise their contribution levels afterward. This indicates a forgiving or at least non-retaliatory disposition: they do not use sanctioning to fight back or engage in vendettas. There is also no clear sign that they strategically appease punishers by altering whom they sanction; their punishment focus remains on low contributors. Overall, they treat being punished as separate from their own norm-enforcing agenda, and they continue to apply their standards regardless of who targeted them.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey effectively never reward, despite many opportunities and despite the presence of numerous consistently high contributors. This is not due to lack of information but appears to be a principled or preference-based choice. Given that the reward mechanism is relatively inefficient compared to punishment, one plausible interpretation is that they prioritize cost-effective norm enforcement and view punishment as the primary tool, while considering rewards as unnecessary or wasteful. They do not appear to use rewards strategically to build alliances or reinforce high cooperation; instead, they rely solely on punishment to shape behavior. This marks them as a “pure sanctioning” type: they are willing to pay to reduce defectors’ payoffs, but not to subsidize cooperators.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThey are occasionally rewarded by others but never visibly change their subsequent behavior to favor those rewarders, either through reciprocal rewards or through selective leniency in punishment. There is no sign that they respond to being rewarded with alliance-building or gratitude-based reciprocity. Their contribution levels remain within their usual band and their punishment targets continue to be determined by contribution levels rather than by prior help received. This suggests that they are relatively insensitive to positive incentives in social terms: they neither seek nor reciprocate reward, maintaining a rule-based approach centered on contribution norms rather than on interpersonal exchange.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey pay close attention to others’ contribution levels and, implicitly, to resulting payoffs, but they do not appear swayed by who is currently rich or poor; their reactions track cooperation rather than earnings. Players who repeatedly contribute low are repeatedly sanctioned by them, even when those players are already being heavily punished by others, suggesting a desire to reinforce the social signal rather than to optimize marginal deterrence alone. They do not punish high earners if those earnings arise from high contributions, implying no envy-based behavior. Conversely, they do not reward high contributors even when those contributors earn strong payoffs, indicating that outcome admiration does not translate into positive transfers. They are also not evidently reacting to others’ punishment or reward expenditures by adjusting their own; they remain focused on their own norm standard rather than coordinating on a shared punishment strategy. Overall, they behave like an independently motivated, contribution-focused enforcer: others’ outcomes matter to them mainly insofar as they reveal who is under-contributing relative to the group norm."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a strict, unwavering full cooperator. They always contribute their entire endowment, with no experimentation or decay, regardless of others’ behavior, the punishment environment, or the approaching end of the game. Their cooperation is unconditional rather than tit‑for‑tat: they continue to fully contribute even when low contributors persist and even when they themselves incur large costs from punishing or rewarding. This suggests they treat full contribution as a normative rule (“the right thing to do”), not a fragile strategy contingent on others. They appear risk‑tolerant about potentially being exploited by low contributors, prioritizing group efficiency or fairness norms over own short‑term payoff. There is no evidence that they adjust contributions based on earnings, punishment they give, or patterns of others’ cooperation; their contribution behavior is highly stable and rigid.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThere is no end‑game decay in cooperation: they maintain full contributions through the final round. However, their use of sanctioning shifts somewhat: they employ both punishment and reward in earlier and mid stages, and remain willing to use costly punishment up to the last round. This indicates horizon awareness does not lead them to “cash out” or relax norms; if anything, they uphold contribution standards to the very end. Their normative stance on contribution appears time‑invariant. Whether they consciously anticipate that future interactions are limited is unknown, but their behavior is consistent with a player who values norm enforcement independently of future strategic gain.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey are willing to incur substantial personal costs to punish, but they do so selectively, triggered mainly by marked deviations from what looks like their internal cooperation standard. Targets are typically very low contributors compared to the group, and they focus especially on extreme or repeated low contributors. They occasionally expand punishment to moderate under‑contributors when their deviation is large relative to a highly cooperative environment. They never punish high contributors or evident cooperators.\n\nThey sometimes coordinate their punishment with what others seem to be doing (e.g., joining collective sanctions on chronic low contributors), which suggests a belief that punishment is appropriate for norm violators and perhaps more effective when multiple players participate. They sometimes allocate multiple punishment units across several low contributors in a single decision, indicating they are motivated by enforcing a general cooperation norm rather than a single, personalized grudge.\n\nTheir punishment pattern appears primarily deterrence‑ or norm‑driven (altruistic punishment) rather than retaliatory: they are not being personally targeted by others, yet they pay large amounts to reduce defectors’ payoffs. They do not use punishment against players who punish others, or against high contributors who might threaten their relative payoff, which suggests low competitiveness and low spite. When a player contributes nothing while others remain highly cooperative, they react with clear punitive action, even in the final round, consistent with a strong intolerance of blatant free‑riding.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nThey are never punished in this game, so their behavioral response to being punished is unknown. There is no evidence of retaliatory tendencies toward punishers, nor of compliance after being sanctioned, because they do not experience sanctions. Given their unwavering cooperation across all rounds, they already comply with a strict norm of contribution, so any hypothetical punishment would be norm‑incongruent and their reaction is uncertain.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey use rewards fairly often and in a pattern that is clearly contingent on others’ cooperation levels. They reserve rewards for consistently high contributors or those who match or exceed the group norm, and they never reward clear under‑contributors. They frequently direct rewards to the same cooperative individuals across multiple opportunities, indicating an attempt to reinforce and encourage a stable coalition of high contributors. They sometimes use reward alone, and sometimes mix it with punishment in the same decision, suggesting they view reward and punishment as complementary tools: reward to support cooperators, punishment to correct defectors.\n\nThey are willing to sacrifice substantial own earnings to provide these rewards, even when the reward technology is merely break‑even (no social multiplier). This implies they are not using reward purely as an instrumental payoff‑maximizing tool but as a normative or relational signal—supporting “good citizens” of the group. Their reward allocation seems strategic in a social sense (reinforcing desirable behavior and perhaps fostering allegiance), but not narrowly self‑interested in terms of immediate income.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThey receive occasional rewards from others, but their own behavior (full contributions plus targeted reward and punishment) does not appear to change in direct response. They do not explicitly reciprocate rewards in a one‑to‑one fashion; rather, they continue to reward high contributors in general, some of whom also reward them and some of whom do not. This suggests they operate on a rule like “reward good cooperators” rather than “reward my rewarders.” They do not form a visible exclusive alliance with any single rewarder; instead, their reward behavior remains principled and pattern‑based.\n\nTheir continued generosity toward certain high contributors, even without direct reciprocation from those specific players in some periods, hints at a stable cooperative orientation rather than purely dyadic reciprocity. That said, because they are themselves often in the set of top cooperators, they may expect that maintaining a cooperative core will in aggregate benefit them, but this expectation is inferred with low confidence.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey pay close attention to others’ contributions and to the sanctioning environment, and they condition their punishments and rewards on those outcomes. When they see low contributors being sanctioned by others, they often join in or maintain pressure on those same players, consistent with endorsing a shared norm of high contribution. When they see very high contributors, they tend to reward them, even if those players already have strong payoffs, indicating they care more about reinforcing behavior than equalizing incomes.\n\nThey do not appear concerned with strict payoff equality. They do not punish successful high earners who contribute fully, nor do they reward low earners whose low income stems from having been punished for free‑riding. Their reactions are aligned with contribution behavior, not with final payoff levels per se. They seem comfortable allowing punished defectors to end up very poor if that reflects their prior under‑contribution.\n\nThey are willing to incur large costs in rounds where their own payoff becomes very low relative to others due to heavy use of punishment and reward. This shows they tolerate short‑term personal loss when using sanctions to influence group behavior. There is no sign that they later “compensate” themselves by defecting or by exploiting unpunished others; they continue to contribute fully and to sanction according to their norm. Overall, they behave as a principled, strong‑norm altruistic cooperator: they track others’ actions closely, respond sharply to norm violations, reinforce high cooperation, and accept personal cost to maintain a high‑contribution environment."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a generally high contributor with moderate downward flexibility. They usually give more than or close to the group average, often at or near full contribution, but occasionally cut back substantially. Their baseline seems to be a “cooperative but not unconditional” stance: they appear willing to forego private payoff to support the public fund, especially when others also contribute strongly.\n\nContribution levels are not chaotic; they vary within a band rather than swinging between extremes every round. Larger drops occur after stretches where the player has already contributed a lot and/or engaged in costly punishment, suggesting some sensitivity to their own payoff position and possible “fatigue” with shouldering the cooperative burden alone.\n\nThey appear conditionally cooperative: when others continue to contribute at high and stable levels, they are happy to match or exceed that. When others’ average contributions sag but remain decent, the player sometimes reduces their own contribution while still staying within the cooperative range. They do not appear to exploit others’ very high contributions by repeatedly free-riding; low contributions are occasional and not a persistent strategy.\n\nThey seem to have a fairness norm centered on “everyone should at least give solid amounts.” Players who consistently give much more (especially full contributors) are treated as especially virtuous. The focal player tolerates some asymmetry but reacts sharply to one specific moderate contributor who also benefits from the public good without matching the cooperative effort of the highest contributors; this indicates a dislike of systematic advantage-taking rather than of any deviation per se.\n\nRisk tolerance seems moderate: they are willing to invest heavily into the public fund even without guarantees of reciprocity, but occasionally protect their own payoff by contributing less, especially after investing in costly punishment or when it is unclear whether high cooperation will persist.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThis player uses punishment actively but very selectively, focusing almost exclusively on a single target. They are clearly willing to incur personal costs to reduce another’s payoff, and they escalate the intensity over time. The target is not the lowest contributor in the group; instead, it is a consistent moderate contributor who tends to earn relatively high payoffs. The focal player does not punish other moderate or low contributors who play similarly, nor do they punish high contributors, indicating that they are not using punishment as a general tool to enforce uniform high contributions.\n\nTheir pattern is consistent with a personalized, norm‑enforcing or expressive motive toward that specific player: “you, in particular, should not be allowed to keep doing this.” The repeated focus and occasional escalation suggest they are trying to influence that player’s behavior or reduce an outcome they see as unfair, rather than simply venting once. The absence of punishment toward anyone else, even when they contribute similarly, shows high selectivity and some internal rule about who “deserves” sanctions.\n\nThere is no evidence of retaliatory punishment, because the focal player is never punished by others. Accordingly, their punishment motive cannot be described as revenge‑driven. Instead, it appears mixed: partly inequity aversion (dislike of that player’s relatively favorable payoff position given their contributions), and partly a desire to deter that player from continuing a pattern the focal player finds objectionable.\n\nThey are willing to spend substantial cumulative resources on punishment, even when it reduces their own payoff noticeably, which indicates that enforcing their perceived fairness standard can override short‑term self‑interest. At the same time, they eventually discontinue punishing once the target’s contributions and the overall group pattern become stable and acceptable to them, suggesting some capacity to “declare victory” or at least to stop escalating indefinitely.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nUnknown. The focal player is never punished in this transcript, so their reactions to being sanctioned—whether they would comply, retaliate, or forgive—cannot be inferred. Any assumptions about their response to punishment would be low confidence and speculative.\n\n<REWARD>\nThe player is clearly willing to reward and does so in a pattern consistent with “pro‑social reinforcement.” They direct rewards to those who contribute at or near full levels and who appear to sustain group welfare. They do not reward moderate or low contributors, even when those individuals are not being punished, indicating that their standard for positive reinforcement is reserved for the very cooperative.\n\nRewarding is intermittent: they do not reward every time someone contributes highly, nor do they reward all high contributors in a given round. This suggests they treat rewards as a targeted, somewhat scarce signal rather than an automatic rule. They may be using reward both to express appreciation and to encourage sustained high contributions from particular players who have been especially consistent.\n\nThere is no evidence they use rewards strategically to manipulate more selfish players into contributing more; instead, they focus on already‑good cooperators. That is more consistent with helping “heroes” than recruiting “defectors.” Given the positive payoff cost of rewarding, they accept a reduction in their own earnings to support and recognize high cooperators, but they do this sporadically rather than continuously, perhaps balancing altruistic signaling with payoff concerns.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nUnknown. The focal player is never rewarded by others in this transcript, so their behavioral or strategic response to receiving rewards—whether they would reciprocate, increase contributions, or form implicit alliances—cannot be inferred.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThe player pays close attention to others’ contributions and resulting payoffs and appears sensitive to the relationship between effort and reward. When high contributors earn moderate or even slightly lower payoffs than some moderate contributors, the focal player intervenes, particularly against the moderate contributor whose earnings often compare favorably despite giving less than the top cooperators. This implies strong outcome‑based fairness concerns with an emphasis on relative payoffs.\n\nThey never sanction or reward based purely on outcome size: they do not attack those with the very highest payoffs when these are paired with high contributions, nor do they protect lower earners if those are also low contributors. Their responses are tied to the pattern “contribution level vs. resulting payoff,” not payoff alone.\n\nThe player seems comfortable with a differentiated outcome structure where high cooperators do well, moderate cooperators do reasonably, and no one is singled out without a behavioral basis. Once the group settles into a stable, high‑contribution equilibrium and the previously targeted player behaves in line with that standard, the focal player stops using punishment and cuts back on reward use as well. That suggests that they primarily deploy sanctions and rewards as tools to adjust the group toward a desired cooperative and fair pattern, and when that pattern is achieved, they revert to simpler contribution decisions without extra costly interventions.\n\nOverall, this player type is a conditionally cooperative, fairness‑oriented enforcer who uses both reward and targeted punishment to shape others’ behavior and relative payoffs, prioritizing alignment between contributions and outcomes over maximizing their own earnings."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a strong initial cooperator who aligns with a high-contribution norm but becomes conditionally cooperative and eventually defects once patterns of free-riding persist. They repeatedly choose the cooperative option even when several others do not, suggesting a fairness or efficiency motive that initially overrides narrow self-interest. Their behavior shows a willingness to keep contributing despite repeated exposure to low contributors, but this is not unconditional: after observing that some players continue to free-ride despite earlier sanctioning attempts, they eventually stop contributing and join the low-contribution group. This shift indicates they condition their cooperation on others’ behavior and on the perceived effectiveness of punishment in restoring fairness. Risk tolerance appears moderate: they are willing to risk being exploited for several periods in hopes of sustaining cooperation but not indefinitely. Their fairness norm seems to expect full or near-full cooperation from the group, with low tolerance for chronic defectors. When they finally defect, it coincides with clear, stable evidence that some others remain non-cooperative, and that sanctions do not reliably convert them; at that point they appear to prioritize self-payoff over maintaining a contribution norm. Overall, their contribution pattern suggests a “principled cooperator who exits the social contract when enforcement fails.”\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThis player is a willing and sometimes heavy punisher, targeting clear low contributors rather than punishing broadly. They do not punish when everyone is cooperating or when free-riding has not worsened, and they refrain from punishing full contributors, indicating selectivity and a focus on deviation from a cooperation norm rather than spite. When they do punish, they spend substantial resources relative to others, implying a readiness to incur meaningful personal costs for norm enforcement, consistent with strong reciprocity or altruistic punishment. They appear to seek deterrence rather than retaliation: their sanctions are directed at chronic or repeated non-contributors and are not used after minor or ambiguous deviations. Their pattern also suggests some sensitivity to cost-effectiveness and group response: they sometimes withhold punishment after it has failed to change defectors’ behavior, and they do not continue escalating indefinitely. They never use punishment in a way that looks like revenge against those who punished them, even when they themselves are later sanctioned, which points away from purely retaliatory motives. Overall, they behave like a principled norm enforcer who punishes under-contributors selectively and forcefully but is willing to disengage from enforcement once it appears ineffective or too costly.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nWhen they themselves are punished, they do not respond with counter-punishment or visible hostility. After being sanctioned as a low contributor later in the game, they neither punish the likely punishers nor immediately switch back to higher cooperation. This indicates that they do not treat punishment as a purely interpersonal attack that must be avenged. Instead, they appear to treat it as part of the game’s enforcement environment. At the same time, the punishment they receive does not appear to induce compliance in the form of renewed contribution; they continue to free-ride rather than reverting to full cooperation. This suggests that, by the time they are targeted, their decision to defect is already anchored in broader beliefs about the futility or unfairness of continued cooperation, and a single episode of being punished is insufficient to override that stance. They thus exhibit non-retaliatory but also non-compliant reactions to being punished: they accept the cost without changing course, implying either resignation, strategic stubbornness, or a belief that the cooperative equilibrium is no longer recoverable. Their level of forgiveness is moderate: they do not retaliate, but they also do not “reward” punishers with improved behavior.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThis player pays close attention to who benefits from the public good and who gains extra from free-riding, and they adjust both their punishment and contributions accordingly. They appear particularly sensitive to situations where low contributors receive higher payoffs than high contributors, which triggers their willingness to spend heavily on punishment despite its personal cost. They also seem to notice whether collective punishment efforts successfully reduce defectors’ advantage: when defectors continue to do well despite repeated sanctions, the player’s own willingness to keep sacrificing for cooperation diminishes, culminating in their eventual defection. They do not target cooperators who spend on punishment, indicating respect for others’ enforcement efforts and a preference for aligning with pro-social enforcers rather than undermining them. At later stages, when some low contributors still obtain relatively favorable payoffs even after deductions, the player appears to update their beliefs and concludes that the environment structurally favors free-riders; this belief likely underpins their final shift to defection. Overall, they respond to others’ outcomes in a norm-focused and outcome-sensitive way: preserving cooperation while punishment seems capable of restoring fairness, but abandoning it once the payoff structure and others’ behavior indicate that sustained cooperation is no longer viable."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a mostly cooperative, occasionally opportunistic type who alternates between full cooperation and short, isolated bouts of free-riding. They consistently either give everything or nothing, never splitting the endowment. Their dominant pattern is to match a high-contribution norm: when others appear to contribute fully and there is no recent conflict, they fully contribute and sustain that level. However, they occasionally test defection even in a clearly cooperative environment, suggesting some willingness to exploit or probe the limits of the group’s tolerance. These defections are not escalatory or sustained; after facing negative consequences, they switch back to full contributions rather than pushing further. They do not react by overcompensating (e.g., contributing extra when others increase slightly); instead they simply restore the baseline cooperative behavior. Their choices indicate low sensitivity to risk about short-term earnings (they are willing to cooperate even after profitable defection is possible) but moderate sensitivity to social sanctions (see below). Overall, they behave like a conditional cooperator who periodically experiments with selfish deviations.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nAwareness of the finite horizon does not lead this player to unravel cooperation. They maintain full contributions through the final stretch and do not attempt a last-moment free-ride, even when they already know that punishment is a credible threat. There is no sign of increasing defection or “grab what you can” behavior as the end approaches. If anything, their behavior in the later part of the game is more stable and cooperative than in the middle, suggesting that once they internalize the group norm and punishment structure, they prioritize maintaining that pattern over exploiting the final rounds. Any subtle beliefs about others’ end-game behavior are unknown, but observed choices indicate that they do not strategically time defections to the end of the game.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThis player never uses costly punishment, despite clear opportunities to sanction a teammate who occasionally defects (when that player is visible). This holds even after they themselves are repeatedly punished for their own defections, and even when punishment appears effective in shaping their behavior. They show no inclination to retaliate, to enforce norms on others, or to engage in “moralistic” punishment. Their stance appears to be a strict cost-avoidance rule regarding sanctioning: they preserve their own payoff and tolerate others’ mistakes or selfishness rather than paying to correct them. Whether this reflects a principled aversion to punishment, a belief that others will handle enforcement, or simple payoff-maximizing reluctance to spend on sanctions is unknown; what is clear is that they act as a non-punishing, compliance-oriented participant.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nWhen punished, the player reliably adjusts toward compliance rather than escalation. After experiencing deductions tied to their own free-riding, they do not continue or intensify defection; instead, they revert to full contributions and keep them stable for an extended period. They also never respond with counter-punishment, even though punishers are identifiable and they repeatedly bear non-trivial deductions. This pattern indicates high responsiveness to social sanctions and a tendency to treat punishment as a corrective signal rather than as an affront. Their behavior suggests a personality inclined toward accommodation and norm acceptance once boundaries are made clear. Any nuanced emotional reaction (resentment vs acceptance) is unknown, but behaviorally they follow a “get back in line and don’t strike back” pattern after being sanctioned."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a generally high contributor who anchors on full cooperation as their default. They repeatedly give the entire endowment when group contributions are moderate to high, and they often maintain this even when some peers free-ride. They does occasionally drop their contribution, but these reductions are sporadic rather than forming a clear downward trend: they sometimes contribute less than the group average and even free-ride outright on a couple of occasions, but then quickly return to full contributions. This pattern suggests a primarily cooperative type with some experimentation or mild frustration, not a deliberate long-term shift to selfishness.\n\nTheir contributions are only weakly conditional on others’ behavior. They do not systematically match the lowest or average peer contributions, and they continue to cooperate in the presence of persistent zero contributors. They appears to follow a fairness norm that “good” behavior is to contribute high amounts, but this norm is flexible enough that they sometimes permit themselves low contributions, especially when others also contribute low or when the environment seems unstable. Risk tolerance for exploitation is moderate: they accept repeated exposure to free-riders instead of systematically protecting themselves with low contributions.\n\nOverall, they behaves like a “prosocial cooperator with occasional lapses”: cooperation is their default identity, but they are not perfectly consistent and may adjust contributions opportunistically or to test the environment.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThere is no clear end-game unraveling in this player’s behavior. Near the final rounds, they mostly keep contributing at or near their earlier cooperative level, including full contributions multiple times very close to the end. Only one late deviation to a lower, but still positive, contribution occurs; this is isolated and not followed by a spiral of defection. They shows awareness of the horizon only in the sense that their pattern includes both cooperative and slightly reduced contributions, but there is no systematic decay as the final round approaches.\n\nThis suggests that they does not strongly adopt backward-induction logic that would dictate sharp contribution cuts near the end. Instead, they appears to treat cooperation as a largely stable norm over time, even when future interaction is limited. Horizon awareness is therefore present (they can see remaining rounds) but has limited practical effect on their strategy.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThe player is a willing and sometimes heavy punisher, but not in every round; punishment episodes are clustered and tied to visible free-riding or substantial under-contribution relative to high contributors. In those episodes, they spends a nontrivial amount of coins on sanctions, indicating that deterring unfairness is, at times, worth real personal cost. The use of punishment is selective: in many rounds with moderate under-contribution they refrain from punishing, but when there is a clear gap between their own high contributions and others’ much lower or zero contributions—especially when low contributors are repeated offenders—they is more likely to sanction.\n\nThe available evidence fits a “norm-enforcing” motive better than a purely retaliatory one. Their punishment is directed in contexts where others contribute clearly below the prevailing cooperative standard while the player is contributing generously. There is no sign that they punishes in response to having been punished, and no evidence of spite toward high contributors. At the same time, they does not punish systematically in every such situation, suggesting that they balances norm enforcement against cost; they appears neither hyper-aggressive nor unwilling to sanction.\n\nBecause outcome information for others is hidden, they cannot directly observe the efficiency of their sanctions. Nonetheless, their willingness to spend repeatedly on punishment implies they values expressing disapproval and attempting to shape behavior, not just maximizing their own immediate payoff.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nThe player is punished once during the game and never again. After this sanction, their subsequent behavior suggests they interprets punishment as guidance rather than provocation. They does not visibly retaliate by punishing likely punishers in later rounds, despite having several opportunities and despite continuing to use punishment in other contexts. Instead, they soon returns to fully cooperative contributions and uses punishment only against clear free-riders, not against peers who are plausibly the earlier punisher.\n\nThis pattern indicates a relatively forgiving and norm-sensitive response style: when sanctioned, they does not escalate conflict and does not appear to engage in anti-social or “revenge” punishment. They adapts in the direction of high cooperation rather than withdrawing from the group or adopting a defensive low-contribution strategy. Their reaction is consistent with an understanding that punishment can be a signal about expected norms, and they accepts that signal without personalizing it.\n\nOverall, they behaves like a prosocial cooperator who uses punishment as a targeted tool to uphold contribution norms, is resilient to being sanctioned, and is more interested in stabilizing cooperation than in settling interpersonal scores."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a generally prosocial but strategic conditional cooperator with moderate volatility. They are clearly willing to contribute fully and repeatedly when cooperation looks viable and when others’ contributions are moderate to high. They also sometimes contribute only part of their endowment and occasionally free‑ride completely, especially when they appear to test boundaries or when they can exploit a cooperative environment late in the game.\n\nTheir contributions cluster around three modes: full contribution, partial contribution, and rare zero contribution. They do not show a simple monotonic decay over time; instead, they alternate between high and medium contributions with occasional low or zero ones. This suggests they are not purely myopic or purely altruistic, but are experimenting and reacting to perceived patterns in others’ behavior.\n\nThey seem to adopt a fairness norm that expects at least moderate contributions from everyone. They often maintain or return to high contributions even after observing free‑riding by some group members, which implies they value sustaining group payoff and may believe punishment can stabilize cooperation rather than needing to personally defect whenever others do. At the same time, they are not rigidly principled: they sometimes under‑contribute when others are contributing well, indicating some willingness to take advantage of the group when it seems low‑risk.\n\nTheir risk tolerance appears moderate. They are willing to “invest” heavily in the public good many times, trusting that the multiplier makes cooperation worthwhile. But they also occasionally hedge by keeping more for themselves, especially after instability or norm violations. Overall, they behave like a pragmatic cooperator who is sensitive to norms but not self‑sacrificing at all costs.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThe player is aware of the horizon and shows some end‑game adjustment, but does not fully collapse cooperation. Near the end, they alternate between high, medium, and zero contributions rather than steadily decreasing. They do free‑ride at least once very near the end in a context where others are still contributing robustly, indicating that they understand the reduced future consequences and are willing to exploit that. However, they also continue to make non‑zero and even high contributions in the final rounds, including when there is effectively no future opportunity for reciprocity.\n\nThis mix suggests that they incorporate end‑game reasoning but are not purely backward‑inducing defectors. Their behavior is consistent with someone balancing two motives: (1) squeezing some extra payoff from late‑game free‑riding when it seems safe, and (2) maintaining a self‑image or norm of being generally cooperative, which keeps them from fully abandoning contributions as the game closes. Their cooperation decays slightly and becomes more opportunistic near the end, but does not collapse.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThe player is a willing and fairly frequent punisher. They use punishment in multiple periods and incur non‑trivial costs to do so. They deploy punishment selectively rather than randomly: punishment usage coincides with situations featuring clear free‑riders or very low contributors relative to the rest of the group. There is no evidence that they punish high contributors or norm‑compliant players, which suggests their punishment is norm‑enforcing rather than spiteful.\n\nGiven the cost/impact ratio, their punishment is not individually profitable in a narrow sense, so their use of it implies a preference for fairness and norm compliance, and/or a belief that punishment can deter future free‑riding and thus protect long‑run payoffs. They do not escalate punishment intensity over time; instead, they occasionally use modest amounts, which fits an enforcement style aimed at sending a signal rather than maximally harming defectors.\n\nThey continue to punish even after group contributions become unstable, which implies they see punishment as an ongoing enforcement tool rather than something reserved for early coordination. There is at least one instance where they punish in a low‑contribution environment, indicating that they may be trying to pull the group back toward higher norms rather than simply giving up when others defect.\n\nOverall, they match a “principled enforcer but not fanatic”: they are willing to pay to punish clear low contributors, likely see punishment as justified by fairness norms, and focus it on defectors instead of using it for random aggression or competitive sabotage. Whether they track specific identities in detail is unknown; the pattern is more consistent with punishing whoever is currently most out of line.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nThe player is punished at least once when they free‑ride. After this, they increase their contributions relative to that zero‑contribution choice, which is consistent with some degree of compliance with punishment signals. However, they do not permanently shift to full cooperation; later they still under‑contribute at times and even free‑ride again in a cooperative environment near the end. This suggests that punishment influences them but does not completely suppress their opportunism.\n\nThere is no clear evidence that they retaliate directly against any specific punisher; from the transcript we cannot see their individual punishment targets, so whether they “hit back” at whoever punished them is unknown. What is observable is that their overall pattern after being punished includes both renewed cooperation and continued use of norm‑enforcing punishment on others, rather than dropping into vendetta behavior or global defection.\n\nTheir response style fits a player who accepts punishment as somewhat legitimate: they adjust upward from the punished low‑contribution behavior but still preserve their own strategic freedom to defect when payoffs or timing look favorable. They appear more inclined to incorporate punishment as information about group norms than to treat it as a purely hostile act requiring revenge."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a moderately erratic, self-interested conditional cooperator who tracks group behavior but does not commit to a stable norm. Contributions range from full to zero, without a simple monotonic trend. The player sometimes contributes less than almost everyone else, sometimes more than many others, and occasionally matches or exceeds the high-contribution core. This pattern suggests that they understand that contributing can be profitable in a highly cooperative group, but they are willing to free-ride when they feel secure or possibly when they feel mistreated.\n\nThey appear sensitive to social context: when the group is strongly cooperative, they are willing to contribute substantially, including at the maximum. However, they are not anchored to a specific fairness rule such as “match the group average” or “always contribute high”; instead, they vary contributions in a way that appears to balance personal gain, perceived fairness, and reactions to recent punishment against them.\n\nRisk-wise, they tolerate the possibility of drawing punishment by under-contributing, especially when others are contributing a lot, and do not consistently “hide” inside the group average. This points to a moderate risk tolerance and a willingness to test how much deviation is tolerated. There is no consistent upward or downward drift; their behavior looks reactive rather than planned over the horizon. Their fairness norm is mixed: they sometimes behave like a contributor who supports the public good and other times like a calculated free-rider, with no clear long-run commitment to one identity.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThe player is willing to use costly punishment, but sparingly and in a targeted way. They never launch large punishment campaigns; they use single, low-cost units when they do punish. Their punishment is not continuous; there are rounds without any punishment and rounds with a small amount. This intermittent pattern indicates they do not see punishment as a default enforcement tool but as something to deploy in specific situations.\n\nBehavior suggests two likely triggers: (a) frustration or perceived unfairness in how others treat them (they are punished several times despite often contributing reasonably), and/or (b) disapproval of very low contributors relative to a cooperative group. Because punishers are anonymous, the player cannot know exactly who targeted them, but their decision to keep punishing lightly even after being punished themselves indicates they accept punishment as part of the strategic environment and do not fully retaliate in a vindictive way. Any retaliatory motive, if present, is limited rather than explosive.\n\nThe scale and frequency of punishment suggest they are more oriented toward signaling and mild deterrence than maximizing harm: they are willing to pay to impose costs, but they appear cost-conscious and do not escalate. They do not behave like a pure altruistic enforcer who systematically punishes all “defectors” to uphold a strict norm; instead, they act as a selective, low-intensity punisher whose primary goal is likely to nudge or express disapproval rather than to police the entire group. Their threshold for intervening is nontransparent from the data and thus the exact rule they use to choose targets is unknown.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThis player closely tracks others’ contributions and outcomes and uses this information to adjust but not fully anchor their own behavior. They see that most others are generally cooperative and that mutual high contribution yields high payoffs, yet they oscillate between participating in this cooperative pattern and exploiting it. Being punished multiple times does not push them into a clearly cooperative or clearly antisocial trajectory; instead, they continue to mix cooperation and free-riding, and they sometimes punish others even when they themselves have recently been punished.\n\nTheir willingness to keep contributing substantially after suffering deductions indicates that they are not purely spiteful or demoralized by punishment. They accept that others can and will impose costs and continue playing the efficiency game rather than shifting into pure revenge or nihilistic defection. At the same time, they do not “buy” full compliance in return for leniency: they never lock into unwavering high contributions to avoid further punishment.\n\nThey respond to visible extreme behaviors in the group (especially very low contributions against a high-contribution backdrop) with some punitive action, suggesting that they care about relative fairness and the integrity of the cooperative environment, but only to a limited, low-intensity degree. They do not systematically reward high contributors (reward is unavailable anyway) nor do they clearly protect fellow cooperators through differential treatment; their reactions are more about occasional correction than about building reputational alliances.\n\nOverall, they are a self-interested, moderately risk-tolerant conditional cooperator who uses light, selective punishment as a tool to express disapproval or mild deterrence, while remaining willing both to benefit from the group’s cooperation and to exploit it when they judge it profitable or feel aggrieved. Their exact beliefs about others’ intentions are unknown, but their behavior is consistent with expecting a generally cooperative group that tolerates some deviation and some punishment “noise.”"

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a generally cooperative, conditional contributor who anchors around the emerging group norm but is willing to deviate when treated unfairly. Early on, they contribute below the group’s typical level, then adjust upward and eventually match or slightly exceed the apparent cooperative standard. They show a clear tendency to raise their own contribution when they see that most others are contributing generously, suggesting a preference for mutual high cooperation rather than exploitation. At the same time, they react sharply when they are punished despite cooperating: after being a high contributor and then receiving a deduction, they temporarily drop their contribution to a very low level, despite the group still contributing relatively well. This indicates conditional cooperation combined with negative reciprocity—willingness to withhold contributions when feeling unfairly targeted. They later return to full contribution, which suggests they are not committed free riders but rather “responsive cooperators” who want high contributions to be met with respect and fairness. Their pattern is consistent with someone who values efficiency and fairness, is moderately risk-tolerant (willing to contribute more when the environment looks cooperative), but is sensitive to norm violations directed at them (especially unjustified punishment).\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThe player uses punishment regularly but sparingly, at a low intensity and with consistent direction. They never spend heavily; instead, they use single, small punishment units in several rounds. Their targeting is strongly aligned with contribution deviations: they appear to focus on those who contribute conspicuously less than the group (such as very low or minimal contributors), and they do not systematically punish high contributors or apparent cooperators. This points to a norm-enforcing, deterrence-oriented motive rather than spite or blind retaliation. There is no clear evidence that they directly retaliate against those who punish them, because punishers are anonymous and there is no systematic shift toward punishing likely aggressors; instead, their punishment pattern is stable and contribution-based. Their own short episode of being punished without punishing back, followed by continued low-level norm enforcement of low contributors, suggests they separate “how I am treated” from “what maintains group norms,” at least in their punishment decisions. Overall, they behave like a mild, principled enforcer: willing to pay to discipline under-contributors, but not trying to maximize harm, and not escalating.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThe player pays close attention to others’ contributions and resultant payoffs and adjusts their own behavior in response, particularly their contributions. When they see the group contributing high amounts and earning strong payoffs, they strengthen their own cooperative stance over time, moving toward full contribution. This reveals a belief that others are, or can be, reliably cooperative, and that matching them is worthwhile. However, they are sensitive to how they themselves are treated: when they receive punishment despite having contributed at or above the cooperative standard, they respond by sharply reducing their next contribution, even though group contributions remain relatively generous. This indicates negative reciprocity and a concern for procedural fairness; being punished unjustly appears to reduce their willingness to cooperate, at least temporarily. Notably, they do not respond by ramping up punishment, which suggests they channel their reaction primarily through contribution behavior rather than counter-punishment. When low contributors are heavily punished by others, the player’s own behavior is consistent with approval of that norm-enforcement: they either also punish such low contributors or continue to contribute fully in later periods when low contributors are being disciplined, implying they see strong punishment of clear free riders as legitimate and helpful for sustaining cooperation. Overall, they come across as a conditional cooperator and mild norm enforcer who rewards fair, high-cooperation environments with high contributions, but withdraws cooperation when they feel unfairly targeted."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a moderately cooperative, efficiency-aware conditional contributor with some opportunistic streaks. Contributions cluster around the group average or slightly below it, with occasional full contributions when group cooperation looks strong. The player clearly understands that contributing is socially beneficial, given that they never free-ride aggressively and sometimes give the maximum possible amount. However, they also show willingness to under-contribute relative to high contributors when overall cooperation appears secure, which suggests a concern for personal payoff and a readiness to “coattail” on others’ generosity.\n\nTheir contribution pattern is responsive to the group rather than fixed. When others’ cooperation is high and stable, they are willing to match or exceed the typical contribution. When some group members start contributing very little and total contributions fall, they do not escalate their own giving to compensate; instead, they stay around a moderate level that protects their payoff while still participating in the public good. This indicates conditional cooperation based on observed peer behavior rather than unconditional altruism.\n\nFairness norms appear present but not strict. The player does not insist on exact equality in contributions, tolerating moderate deviations as long as the overall cooperation level remains high. They seem more bothered by very low contributors than by small under-contributions. Risk tolerance is medium: they are willing to risk higher contributions when others appear cooperative, but they do not keep pushing contributions upward when the environment grows more erratic.\n\nOverall, their type is a “pragmatic conditional cooperator”: they value the public good and prefer high-contribution equilibria, but they also guard against being exploited and are comfortable contributing somewhat less than the most generous group members when that seems safe.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThis player is an active, norm-enforcing punisher who primarily targets conspicuously low contributors and appears focused on shaping group behavior rather than retaliating for personal harm. They do not punish every round, and when they do, they spend a meaningful but not extreme amount on punishment. This indicates they are willing to incur real costs to enforce norms, but they are not obsessed with punishment nor are they punishing indiscriminately.\n\nTheir punishment choices are selective: they direct punishment toward players whose contributions are far below the informal group standard, especially when those low contributions stand out amidst generally high cooperation. They do not appear to punish those who are roughly at or above the group mean, even if those players are slightly below the maximum, suggesting they are enforcing a “no blatant free-riding” rule rather than a “everyone must give the maximum” rule.\n\nThe timing of their punishment aligns more with deterrence than with revenge. They are not personally targeted by punishment in a way that would justify strong retaliatory motives, yet they still choose to punish low contributors on some occasions. This behavior is consistent with a desire to correct or deter free-riding for the sake of the group outcome. They also show that punishment decisions can change over time: they sometimes refrain from punishing despite the presence of low contributors, which suggests they may be balancing the marginal benefit of further norm enforcement against the cost to themselves, or inferring that others are already punishing the same targets.\n\nThey do not use punishment to discipline high contributors or to respond spitefully to others’ payoffs; there is no evidence of antisocial punishment. Their pattern fits a “prosocial, efficiency-minded norm enforcer” who uses punishment strategically against clear deviants, not as an expression of hostility or competition.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThis player tracks others’ contributions and the aggregate payoff environment closely and uses that information to adjust both contributions and punishment. When the group’s overall payoff is high and cooperation is strong, they are willing to maintain or even increase their own contribution and sometimes abstain from punishment, effectively free-riding partially on the social order while still supporting it. When they see individuals benefiting from the group while contributing very little, and especially when those individuals still end up with solid payoffs, they become more willing to spend to reduce those players’ earnings.\n\nThey seem more sensitive to contribution behavior than to final payoff levels per se. High earners are not punished if their contributions are also high; low contributors are targeted even if their payoffs are not the very highest. This suggests that what matters to them is whether others have “earned” their payoffs by contributing adequately, not the absolute size of those payoffs.\n\nThe player appears to infer and rely on emergent norms. When many others also spend on punishment and low contributors suffer large total deductions, the player sometimes holds back from adding their own punishment, implying they expect group-level enforcement to suffice. Conversely, when low-contribution behavior looks under-sanctioned relative to its deviation from the norm, they step in and contribute to punishment. This indicates a belief that punishment is a shared responsibility rather than solely theirs.\n\nIn terms of learning, the player adapts gradually: they adjust contributions up or down in response to observed group cooperation and punishment patterns, but they do not show abrupt swings or extreme reactions. As the environment becomes more heterogeneous, with some players contributing very low amounts and others remaining high, they neither collapse into full free-riding nor escalate into constant punishment. This stability suggests a temperament that is measured and pragmatic, valuing cooperation and fairness while continuously weighing personal cost against group-level benefits."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a consistently high contributor with mild responsiveness to the group. They start by giving substantially more than the minimal cooperative norm and then move quickly to full contributions. Across the game they keep their contributions at or near the maximum, with only small downward adjustments. Their giving is not purely mechanical: when group contributions dip, they modestly reduce their own, and when low contributions come from clear outliers, they still remain above the group average. This suggests a conditional cooperator with a strong internal norm to support the public good rather than a strict “mirror” of others’ behavior.\n\nThey do not appear highly risk‑averse about being exploited; they continue to contribute generously even after receiving unexplained punishment and in the presence of repeat low contributors. Efficiency matters to them: the environment has a high marginal per capita return, and their behavior matches someone who recognizes that mutual high contributions are collectively and individually beneficial. They also accept minor personal disadvantage to uphold this cooperative pattern, rather than optimizing narrowly for short‑term payoff. Overall, they fit a “pro‑social conditional cooperator” type with a strong fairness/efficiency norm and moderate tolerance for free‑riding before adjusting downward.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThis player is willing to use costly punishment selectively and in a principled way. They do not punish every round, and they never appear to punish high or average contributors. Their punishment is concentrated on clear low contributors and is applied at a non‑trivial intensity when they act, indicating they care about enforcement rather than symbolic gestures.\n\nTheir pattern fits a norm‑enforcing role: they punish those who contribute far below the informal group standard, particularly when such behavior threatens the cooperative equilibrium. They do not show clear signs of retaliation toward those who might have punished them earlier; punished targets are better explained by low contributions than by any clear link to their own prior deductions. They also refrain from punishing borderline cases, indicating some threshold before they act rather than punishing any deviation. This suggests a “strong conditional cooperator with altruistic punishment”: willing to spend to discipline free‑riders but not inclined to use punishment vindictively or indiscriminately. They appear motivated more by deterrence and fairness maintenance than by short‑term payoff maximization.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThis player observes others’ contributions and net payoffs and updates their behavior in a measured way. When the group largely maintains high contributions and punishment keeps defectors in check, they continue to contribute fully and abstain from further punishment, suggesting satisfaction with the emergent norm. When conspicuous low contributors appear and sanctions against them are either absent or appear insufficient, the player both slightly reduces their own contribution and steps in with targeted punishment, indicating sensitivity to both actions and outcomes.\n\nThey do not escalate or withdraw cooperation in response to personally receiving punishment; their giving remains high and their use of punishment continues to target low contributors rather than suspected punishers. This implies they interpret outcomes primarily through a cooperative‑norm lens rather than through a personal grievance lens. They tolerate some inequality in payoffs when it arises from differences in contribution and sanctioning, but respond when inequality is driven by sustained low contributions benefiting from the group. Overall, they read the outcome structure for signals about the health of cooperation and adjust in ways intended to stabilize a high‑contribution, norm‑compliant environment."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a generally high, but not unconditional, contributor. They regularly give well above the group’s average and are comfortable matching or exceeding the modal cooperation level when others are cooperative. They appear to value maintaining a strong public good and are willing to sacrifice private payoff to do so.\n\nTheir contributions are adaptive rather than fixed. When most others contribute high amounts, they push their own contribution higher, sometimes up to the full endowment, indicating a strong conditional-cooperation tendency: they are more generous when they perceive the group as cooperative and stable. When there is a noticeable emergence of very low contributors, they reduce their own contribution substantially, signaling that they expect at least a minimal norm of participation and are not willing to indefinitely subsidize clear free riders.\n\nThey show some sensitivity to fairness: they do not insist on perfect equality, but they react behaviorally when others’ contributions fall far below the group cluster. This reaction includes both downward adjustment of their own giving and increased punitive activity, suggesting they link fairness norms to both contribution and sanctions. Their willingness to swing their contribution both upward and downward suggests moderate risk tolerance: they are prepared to risk being more generous than necessary when the group looks trustworthy, but they will also risk triggering conflict by cutting back when norms are violated.\n\nOverall, the player fits a “conditional altruist with enforcement”: they like high cooperation, readily invest in it, but make their cooperation contingent on others meeting a baseline standard and on having tools to discipline severe free riding.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThis player is a consistent, low-intensity punisher who targets clear under-contributors and apparent free riders. They are willing to spend on punishment in most rounds, but typically in small, single-unit amounts. This pattern indicates that they see punishment as a tool to enforce norms rather than as a way to maximize immediate material payoff, since the punishment technology is costly and they still choose to bear that cost.\n\nTheir targets are systematically those contributing conspicuously less than the bulk of the group, particularly very low or minimal contributors. When someone’s effort to the public good is far below what the player and most others are doing, the player reliably participates in sanctioning. The player does not appear to punish high or typical contributors, suggesting they are not using punishment opportunistically or for spite; instead, they are discriminating and norm-oriented.\n\nThey are willing to punish even when their own contribution is high and the group outcome is strong, which indicates an enforcement motive rather than pure frustration or retaliation over personal loss. At the same time, when low contributing behavior becomes more widespread or extreme, the player reduces their own contribution and sometimes withholds punishment, hinting at a limit to how much they will invest in “policing” if they feel it will not be effective or reciprocated by others.\n\nTheir use of relatively small punishment units suggests a preference for calibrated, signaling sanctions rather than maximal harm. They seem to aim for deterrence and norm communication—reminding deviators of the expected standard—rather than trying to drive them out or impose disproportionate suffering. There is no evidence of retaliatory punishment in response to being personally punished; after being sanctioned themselves once, they do not launch a visibly harsher or broader punishment campaign. This implies they either do not infer who punished them or deliberately avoid vendettas, staying focused on contribution behavior rather than on payoff shocks.\n\nIn summary, this player acts as a mild, principled enforcer: ready to pay to punish clear free riders, careful not to punish cooperators, and using punishment as a corrective signal more than as revenge.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThis player pays close attention to the pattern of others’ contributions and the resulting payoffs, and they adjust both contribution and punishment accordingly. When they observe a cluster of high contributions leading to high payoffs for almost everyone, they are comfortable sustaining or increasing their own cooperation, even while spending coins on sanctioning a few deviants. The fact that they continue to punish while group welfare is high suggests they prioritize maintaining norms over squeezing out maximum immediate profit.\n\nWhen others’ outcomes reflect extreme free riding—visible in low contributions that nonetheless share in the redistributed pool—they respond by combining two moves: they reduce their own contributions, and they either initiate or maintain targeted punishment toward those low contributors. This shows that they interpret others’ good payoffs (achieved via low contributions) as an unfair gain that justifies costly correction. They do not, however, lash out against everyone; they distinguish between typical contributors whose payoffs are high but norm-consistent, and outliers whose payoffs seem unearned.\n\nAfter receiving punishment themselves once, they do not obviously change strategy in a way that reflects fear of being punished for high or low contributions; instead, their main behavioral inflections track the structure of others’ contributions and apparent norm violations. This suggests they care more about contribution patterns and fairness than about their own short-run payoff volatility.\n\nThey appear to infer that most other players are broadly cooperative but that a subset is willing to free ride if unpunished. Their behavioral response is to support the cooperative majority by staying generous and, at the same time, to participate in disciplining the minority through modest, repeated sanctions. If they see that others are also punishing egregious under-contributors—reflected in heavy deductions to those players—they continue to invest in the norm, likely believing that the enforcement environment is shared rather than solitary.\n\nOverall, the player treats others’ outcomes as signals about the health of the cooperation norm. High, fairly earned payoffs lead them to remain cooperative and gently enforcing; visible gains from free riding trigger lower contributions and focused punishment."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is primarily a free-rider with occasional, short-lived switches to full contribution. Their baseline is to keep their entire endowment and live off others’ contributions, even when most others contribute. They only ever use the extreme options available (all or nothing) and show no gradual adjustment, suggesting simple heuristic play rather than fine-tuned optimization. Full contributions appear sporadically and do not persist even when others also contribute a lot, indicating that they do not strongly internalize a cooperative norm or aim for stable reciprocity. They tolerate benefiting from others’ generosity without matching it and do not appear concerned with aligning their behavior to group averages. Their risk tolerance regarding cooperation is low: when in doubt, they default to defection and prioritize immediate personal payoff over potential collective gain. Any cooperative moves seem exploratory or context-reactive rather than part of a sustained fairness norm. Their fairness preferences are weak or inconsistent: they sometimes join high-contribution environments but do not maintain that stance when it would require sacrificing their own payoff repeatedly.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey make relatively infrequent use of punishment and, when they do punish, it is light and isolated rather than part of a systematic enforcement strategy. There is no clear pattern of punishing low contributors versus high contributors; their punishment choices do not obviously track cooperative norms, defectors, or extreme punishers. They do not appear to engage in costly norm enforcement aimed at stabilizing cooperation, nor do they join group-wide punishment cascades. Their spending on punishment is modest overall, consistent with a preference to preserve their own payoffs rather than invest heavily in shaping others’ behavior. Motivationally, the limited and sporadic punishment suggests either mild expressive reactions (e.g., annoyance at being targeted or at seeming unfairness) or experimentation with the mechanism rather than deliberate deterrence. They are not vengeful in any obvious, sustained way and do not escalate punishment in response to others’ aggression. Selectivity and targeting rules are unclear (low-confidence: unknown); there is no strong evidence they systematically reward cooperators or sanction free-riders via punishment choices.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nThey experience substantial punishment across the game but do not clearly retaliate against specific identified punishers, nor do they shift toward stable cooperation to appease them. When punished, their subsequent contributions generally remain low or revert to defection after brief cooperative excursions, suggesting limited compliance with punitive pressure. There is no consistent pattern of “hit back at whoever punished me” visible; their rare uses of punishment do not line up clearly with those who previously targeted them, at least at the coarse resolution available here. This indicates a relatively low retaliatory drive, or at least low willingness to spend on revenge. At the same time, they also do not respond with durable “forgiveness-and-cooperation” after being sanctioned; their cooperative switches are temporary and do not map cleanly onto punishments received, so any appeasement motive is weak or absent. Overall, they appear behaviorally resistant to social control via punishment: they absorb deductions and continue to prioritize self-benefit, with only short, inconsistent deviations toward cooperation.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey observe others repeatedly spending heavily on punishment and sometimes driving their own or others’ payoffs negative, yet they do not join these extremes. This suggests they notice but do not imitate costly moralistic or spiteful behavior. They seem content to let others bear the cost of enforcing or attacking, while they maintain a relatively payoff-protective stance. Very high punishment expenditures by others do not trigger a clear change in their own contribution level; they neither become significantly more cooperative to avoid becoming a target nor start punishing in solidarity with other punishers. Likewise, they do not clearly favor or protect consistent cooperators; they neither reward nor materially defend those who contribute a lot or suffer high deductions. Their reaction to others’ payoffs and punishment patterns is largely passive: they adapt contributions only weakly and remain focused on individual gain rather than on shaping group outcomes. Their beliefs about others (inferred from behavior) likely include the expectation that others will keep contributing or keep punishing each other regardless of the focal player’s own actions, leading them to treat the social environment as something to exploit rather than something to stabilize."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is an initially strong cooperator who later becomes a strategic, profit-focused conditional contributor with notable volatility. Early on, they reliably give the full endowment or close to it, even when some others contribute much less. Over time, they reduce contributions substantially in some periods, including very low or zero contributions, then occasionally return to high contributions. This pattern suggests that they start with a cooperative default but update behavior in response to group dynamics and their own payoff experience.\n\nThey appear sensitive to perceived free-riding and to the decline of others’ contributions: when the environment looks less cooperative on average or more erratic, they sharply cut back. They do not insist on strict equal contributions; they sometimes continue contributing fully despite visible low contributors. However, they do not maintain unconditional cooperation: their later low contributions indicate a willingness to exploit higher-contributing others once they feel cooperation is unstable or that they have already “done their part.” They show moderate risk tolerance early (sustained high cooperation despite the low MPCR and some free-riding) but later prioritize assured private payoffs over the risky hope of maintaining high group cooperation.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThey are clearly horizon-aware and exhibit classic end-game-related decay in cooperation. As the game progresses into later stages, they increasingly protect their own earnings rather than the public good. Contributions, which were generally high earlier, become more conservative and sometimes minimal in the later phase, especially in the very last round. This is consistent with an understanding that future opportunities for reciprocation or reputation-based benefits are limited, so maintaining high contributions no longer serves a strategic purpose.\n\nThe decay is not purely linear; they occasionally re-escalate contributions even late, suggesting that they keep testing whether cooperation can still be profitable. Nonetheless, in the final round they revert to near-minimal giving despite the presence of several high contributors, indicating that end-game incentives dominate any residual prosocial motive. Overall, the player acts as if they anticipate others’ end-game defection and respond pre-emptively by prioritizing self-interest.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey are an active but increasingly selective rewarder. In the earlier and middle portions of the game, they are willing to incur nontrivial personal cost to give rewards. They tend to reward when group contributions are high and when they themselves are also contributing a lot, suggesting they use reward as a tool to reinforce a cooperative equilibrium they value. Their willingness to pay for reward in a setting where rewarding is individually neutral (same cost as benefit) indicates a genuine preference for sustaining cooperation, not just narrow payoff maximization.\n\nAs the game proceeds and cooperation becomes more uneven and more players engage in heavy, sometimes arguably inefficient reward spending, the focal player reduces their own reward expenditures and eventually stops rewarding altogether in later rounds. This shift suggests that their rewarding is contingent: they invest in reward when they see it as promoting a stable, mutually beneficial environment, but withdraw when the environment looks noisy, when large reward expenditures by others appear wasteful, or when the horizon shortens. They do not use reward to punish or discipline low contributors (which is not available mechanically), nor do they appear to reward in a purely “charitable” fashion regardless of others’ behavior. Instead, they appear strategic: reward is a means to support a cooperative norm as long as that seems viable and useful.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThey receive noticeable amounts of reward from others and initially reciprocate in kind, suggesting a reciprocal orientation toward identifiable rewarders. When they are receiving reward while contributing highly, they continue to reward in return, aligning with an alliance-building or mutual support interpretation: they appear to appreciate being rewarded and respond by maintaining cooperative and rewarding behavior during that phase.\n\nOver time, however, even though some peers continue to reward others heavily, the focal player’s own reward behavior declines, including periods where they cease rewarding despite still occasionally getting rewarded. This indicates that reciprocity is not unconditional. They value and respond to reward when it aligns with a profitable cooperative environment, but they are not locked into reciprocal obligations if the broader conditions (e.g., rising heterogeneity in contributions, large or erratic reward spending by others, and approaching end-game) make continued reciprocity seem less worthwhile. In short, they are a conditional reciprocator: they respond positively to early reward and cooperative signals, but later prioritize efficiency and horizon concerns over maintaining dyadic reward relationships.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey pay evident attention to others’ contribution levels, payoff outcomes, and reward expenditures, and they adapt their own behavior accordingly. When the group exhibits high or improving contributions and moderate, seemingly purposeful rewarding, they both contribute and reward more, even when some individuals deviate. As they observe some players persistently contributing very little yet earning high payoffs, and others spending heavily on reward in ways that may look excessive or inefficient, they increasingly shift toward lower contributions and reduced or zero reward spending, while enjoying higher round payoffs themselves.\n\nThey do not appear motivated by spite or inequality aversion in a punitive sense: they never use reward in a way that directly reduces others’ payoffs, and they tolerate persistent high earners who contribute very little without trying to offset that via negative actions (which are mechanically unavailable) or by targeted withholding of reward toward those specific individuals (they simply scale down reward overall). Their reaction to others’ high payoffs when they are free-riding is to join the more self-interested strategy rather than to sacrifice income to discipline them indirectly.\n\nAt the same time, they remain responsive to cooperative signals: when many peers return to higher contributions and reward patterns after a low-cooperation spell, the focal player sometimes raises their own contributions again. This reflects a learning, adaptive style focused on tracking the net cooperative climate: they upshift both cooperation and reward when the group looks cohesive and the time horizon is still meaningful, and downshift when they infer that others’ outcomes and behaviors signal instability, exploitation, or imminent end-game defection.\n\nOverall, this player type is a “conditional altruistic strategist”: initially generous and willing to pay to support cooperation and reciprocate reward, but increasingly self-protective and opportunistic as group behavior becomes noisier and as the end of the game approaches."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a generally high contributor who leans cooperative even when others free‑ride. They often give close to or at the full endowment, with only occasional reductions. These lower contributions appear more like mild shading in response to deteriorating group cooperation or end‑game position than a switch to full free‑riding. They do not match others’ low contributions closely; instead, they maintain contributions above the group’s minimum tendency, suggesting an internal norm of “should contribute fairly a lot” rather than strict payoff maximization. Their behavior indicates moderate risk tolerance: they keep contributing substantially despite weak assurance that others will do the same. Conditionality is present but soft—when the public contribution level drops or becomes erratic, they reduce somewhat, yet they never exploit very high group contributions by sharply under‑contributing. Fairness norms seem pro‑social: they appear more willing to risk being the sucker than to risk dragging the public good down.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nAwareness of the finite horizon does not trigger a collapse to zero cooperation. In later rounds, they do trim contributions relative to their own earlier highs, but they remain a positive contributor even when others start dropping. This pattern suggests that the player understands that payoffs are declining and cooperation is becoming less reliable, yet they continue to treat the interaction as worth sustaining. There is no strong last‑round defection spike; instead they end with a moderate contribution when many others severely cut back or drop to near zero. This implies that they either discount backward‑induction logic or prioritize norm consistency and “how I play” over strict end‑game payoff optimization. Their behavior is consistent with someone who values maintaining a cooperative identity through to the end more than squeezing out maximal final‑round earnings.\n\n<REWARD>\nThis player is a very heavy and persistent rewarder. They spend substantial portions of their payoff on rewarding others across many rounds, often at levels that noticeably erode their own earnings. They continue to reward even when returns to doing so are weak or one‑sided from the standpoint of their own payoffs. The triggers for reward are primarily prosocial behavior: they direct rewards most strongly toward high or reliable contributors and seldom, if ever, toward very low contributors. They appear to target players who either consistently support the public good or who step up in otherwise low‑contribution environments. The pattern indicates that they use reward as a normative signal rather than as a tightly optimized investment. They seem willing to “overpay” to support or encourage cooperators, and they maintain this generosity through both good and bad contribution climates. There is no evidence of them withdrawing rewards in systematic retaliation for low contributions; instead, they tend to simply omit reward for weak contributors rather than spending strategically to reshape them.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nWhen others reward them, they do not strongly pivot their strategy toward direct reciprocity. Though they do receive rewards from several peers, there is no clear pattern of them selectively increasing reward back to those same individuals relative to similarly cooperative others. Their reward behavior remains broad‑based and anchored more on contribution patterns than on who has personally transferred coins to them. This points to low emphasis on personalized alliances or tit‑for‑tat relationships and higher emphasis on group‑level norms. Being rewarded does not induce extreme shifts in their own contribution levels, suggesting that they see rewards more as confirmation that cooperation is valued than as contingent bargains that must be immediately repaid. If they ever do reciprocate specific rewarders more than others, it is subtle and not systematic enough to infer confidently. Overall, they behave more like a principled prosocial rewarder than a coalition‑builder or reputation trader.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey track others’ contributions and outcomes and respond in ways that prioritize supporting high contributors and visible cooperators. Players whose payoffs are high because they both contribute and are rewarded by others often also receive this player’s reward, indicating a tendency to align with perceived “good citizens” of the group. They show little inclination to target players who already earn very high payoffs through low contributions plus others’ generosity; instead, they generally avoid rewarding clear free‑riders, even when those free‑riders’ outcomes are strong. When the overall group payoff environment deteriorates, they pull back slightly on contributions but often continue spending substantially on rewarding the remaining cooperators, implying that they are sensitive to others’ costs and are willing to shore up those who continue to bear a burden for the public good. They appear to accept personally lower payoffs as a consequence of this stance. There is no evidence of spite or envy toward high earners; their adjustments are about contribution behavior, not simply relative income. Consequently, their type is best described as a norm‑driven, inequality‑tolerant cooperator who uses reward as a costly signal of approval and encouragement rather than as a strict instrument of personal gain."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a moderate, flexible cooperator with clear conditional tendencies and some opportunism. They rarely choose extremes; most of the time they contribute an intermediate share of their endowment rather than all or nothing. Their baseline pattern is to give a stable, mid-level amount when the group appears broadly cooperative and outcomes are good.\n\nThey adjust contributions in response to the observed environment. When others’ contributions are high and fairly uniform, they are willing to stay in the cooperative range or even temporarily increase their own contribution sharply. When they see contributions drop, become more uneven, or when there is visible free-riding or volatility, they reduce their own contributions substantially, sometimes to very low levels. This indicates conditional cooperation rather than rigid adherence to a fixed norm.\n\nThey show no strict “fair split” norm relative to the group average: they sometimes contribute below what many peers give while still accepting the benefits of the public pool. At the same time, they never commit to completely exploiting others for many consecutive rounds, and they do occasionally choose relatively high or full contributions even after periods of partial free-riding. This mix suggests they care about payoff security and efficiency, but not about strict equity.\n\nRisk-wise, they are willing to risk higher contributions when past environments look cooperative and rewards circulate, but they do not sustain that risk if they perceive instability. They seem more payoff-sensitive than principle-driven but avoid the most aggressive free-riding, maintaining a “moderate contributor who adjusts to the climate” profile.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThe player appears end-game aware and willing to decouple from cooperative norms as the horizon approaches. Contributions fluctuate more in later rounds, including both notably high and very low contributions. The absence of future repercussions seems to free them to alternate between cooperative and self-serving moves depending on recent signals.\n\nThey do not display a monotonic decline in contributions typical of pure backward induction; instead, they mix opportunistic under-contribution with occasional large contributions even quite late. This pattern suggests they recognize the limited remaining rounds but still respond to the immediate contribution context rather than treating the end-game purely as a period for exploitation. Overall, they show some cooperation decay and greater volatility near the end, consistent with horizon awareness but moderated by conditional responsiveness.\n\n<REWARD>\nThis player is an active but selective user of rewards early and mid-game, and almost entirely withdraws from rewarding later on. When they do spend on rewards, they usually allocate a small number of units and target individuals whose contribution levels are relatively high or at least in the cooperative range. They do not spend on low contributors or clear free-riders. This indicates a pro-social reinforcement motive: they use rewards to signal approval of cooperation, not to subsidize non-cooperators.\n\nThey are sensitive to personal cost: they never escalate into the extreme reward-spending levels seen in some peers, and over time they systematically reduce reward spending and eventually stop using it in many later rounds. This suggests that the player learns that heavy rewarding is not personally profitable or that cooperation is sufficiently stabilized (or fragile) that further rewarding is not worth the expense.\n\nTheir reward strategy is simple and rule-like: “reward decent or high contributors a little, especially when the group looks cooperative,” rather than highly fine-tuned or relational. They do not appear to use rewards to manage complex coalitions or to bargain; instead, they treat reward as a limited tool for supporting group cooperation under favorable conditions.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nWhen this player receives reward, their behavior shows little evidence of strong direct reciprocity toward specific benefactors. They do not respond with obvious targeted reward-back patterns, nor do they appear to single out particular partners for special treatment afterwards. Any reciprocity, if present, is weak or highly diffuse and thus indistinguishable from their general tendency to reward cooperators.\n\nThey do not dramatically increase contributions after being rewarded, nor do they sustain high contributions solely due to recognition. Their main drivers remain the overall contribution environment and payoff structure rather than personal gratitude. They tolerate receiving relatively little reward compared to some high contributors and do not visibly react by retaliating (via withdrawal of reward) against generous peers who fail to reward them. This points to low emphasis on interpersonal score-keeping and alliance-building, and higher emphasis on aggregate patterns of cooperation.\n\nOverall, the player treats reward received as pleasant but non-binding; it does not appear to fundamentally alter their strategy.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThis player pays attention to others’ contributions and reward behavior and adjusts accordingly, but in a coarse-grained, pattern-based manner rather than with fine discrimination. They increase or maintain moderate contributions when many others contribute generously and when reward activity is widespread, indicating that broad cooperative climates encourage them. When they observe more uneven or declining contributions, or when some players free-ride while others still give a lot, they are quick to scale down their own contributions, suggesting aversion to being exploited and sensitivity to group-level fairness.\n\nThey do not visibly punish via reward withdrawal at the individual level; instead, their reactions look aggregate: when the group as a whole seems less cooperative or more chaotic (some giving very little, some over-rewarding), they reduce both contributions and use of reward. They also appear unresponsive to extreme patterns of others burning payoff on very high reward expenditures; such costly signaling by others does not entice them into matching that intensity.\n\nThey seem more concerned with their own payoff trajectory and broad norms of cooperation than with specific individuals’ round payoffs or net earnings. High or low payoffs for others only matter to them insofar as they reflect or predict future contribution behavior. Socially, this corresponds to a cautious, efficiency-minded conditional cooperator who is willing to support cooperators but will not sacrifice heavily to correct or counteract others’ outcomes."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a predominantly high contributor who occasionally free‑rides when conditions look especially favorable or when others already provide ample public good. After an initial exploratory defection, the player most often chooses to contribute fully, suggesting that they recognize the social efficiency of contributing and generally align with a cooperative norm. Their contribution pattern is not perfectly stable: they intersperse a few zero contributions among many full contributions, indicating some strategic opportunism rather than unconditional altruism.\n\nThey appear conditionally cooperative in a loose, aggregate sense: when the surrounding environment looks broadly cooperative, they usually continue to contribute, and brief deviations to zero do not lead to a sustained collapse of their own cooperation. However, they do not seem to condition finely on each individual peer’s past behavior; instead, they treat the group as a whole and maintain high contributions even when several specific others repeatedly contribute nothing. Fairness norms seem present but weakly enforced: the player tolerates the presence of persistent free‑riders without systematically withdrawing their own cooperation or engaging in tit‑for‑tat patterns. Risk tolerance is moderate: they are willing to incur substantial contribution and, at times, nontrivial reward costs even when returns are uncertain, but they also occasionally protect their private payoff by defecting when the group appears able to sustain high total contributions without them.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nAwareness of the finite horizon does not provoke a standard end‑game unraveling for this player. They continue to contribute fully through the final stretch and do not display a monotonic decline in cooperation as the last round approaches. Their sporadic defections appear scattered rather than concentrated at the end; there is no clear evidence of a calculated final‑round exploitation of the group. The player instead maintains a generally cooperative stance to the conclusion, suggesting either that they discount backward induction, prioritize consistency of behavior, or place value on internal norms of cooperation over short‑term final‑period gains. Any subtle adjustment of strategy specifically in response to the remaining number of rounds is unknown or at best low‑confidence.\n\n<REWARD>\nThis player is willing to use the reward mechanism, but only intermittently and in a targeted way. They do not reward every round; instead, they deploy rewards in a few episodes, sometimes at noticeable personal cost. This indicates a readiness to sacrifice private coins to support or signal approval of cooperative behavior, consistent with a pro‑social or norm‑reinforcing inclination. They do not appear to reward themselves (not possible in this design) and cannot target others individually in the record provided, so expectations about specific recipient choices are unknown. However, the timing of their reward spending tends to align with environments that are already somewhat cooperative rather than with punitive or corrective attempts in very low‑contribution contexts, suggesting that they use rewards more as positive reinforcement than as rescue attempts in failing groups.\n\nTheir own receipt of substantial rewards in at least one episode does not obviously change their subsequent willingness to reward: they neither become consistently generous nor systematically withdraw from rewarding thereafter. This points to a relatively stable but selective reward orientation rather than a reactive gratitude‑driven spree. Overall, they function as a conditional rewarder who reinforces cooperation when it seems efficacious, but who is not committed to continuous costly encouragement and remains attentive to their own payoff."

They do not insist on strict fairness in the sense of always matching others’ average contribution; instead, they seem comfortable alternating between periods of bearing more of the cooperative burden and periods of exploiting the group benefit while contributing nothing.\n\nThey show no clear upward or downward trend across the game: their contribution choices fluctuate in response to the environment, but do not steadily escalate or decay. This suggests they are responsive rather than myopically selfish or rigidly altruistic. They tolerate personal payoff losses in some instances in order to maintain or support group provision (cooperating even when many others do not), but they also take advantage of cooperative environments when they sense they can do so.\n\nRisk-wise, they accept the risk that cooperation may not be rewarded in any given round. They continue to contribute fully even after instances where their cooperation has not clearly improved their own payoff. This indicates some baseline willingness to act prosocially independent of immediate, guaranteed personal gain, though they temper this with intermittent free-riding, which keeps them from being a pure altruist.\n\nOverall, their contribution persona is: a conditional but somewhat forgiving cooperator who oscillates strategically between full cooperation and opportunistic defection, without strong insistence on strict equality of effort.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThe player shows horizon awareness in the sense that they know how many rounds remain, but they do not engage in a classic end-game collapse of cooperation. In the final stretch, they continue to choose full contributions frequently rather than systematically shifting to pure free-riding as the game nears conclusion.\n\nTheir late-game behavior is consistent with their earlier pattern: they remain willing to contribute fully when others are mostly cooperative and do not appear to change strategy purely because the game is about to end. There is no evidence of deliberate “last-round exploitation” where they abruptly defect after a history of cooperation. Instead, they maintain approximately the same mix of cooperative and non-cooperative decisions.\n\nThis suggests that their decision rule is anchored more in the contemporaneous pattern of others’ behavior and their own underlying preferences than in backward induction about future opportunities. They either do not prioritize maximizing terminal wealth via last-round defection, or they do not fully apply that logic in practice. Their response to the end game is thus characterized by relative stability of cooperative tendencies rather than strategic unraveling.\n\n<REWARD>\nThe player is actively willing to use the reward mechanism and does so multiple times, but not in every round. They never spend extremely large amounts on rewards, yet they are prepared to incur a meaningful personal cost to transfer benefits to others, showing a willingness to pay to support or encourage certain behaviors.\n\nTheir rewarding is selective and appears contingent on perceived cooperative norms rather than random generosity. They do not automatically reward every time the group cooperates, nor do they always refrain when the group is less cooperative. Instead, they occasionally invest in rewards when the environment seems to justify reinforcing cooperation or when they may be reciprocating benefits they themselves have received. Because rewarders are not identifiable, any use of the mechanism by this player cannot be designed to build a direct reputation with specific individuals; rather, it serves as an anonymous norm-enforcement or group-level signal. Nonetheless, they still spend on rewards at a personal cost, indicating intrinsic or strategic value they place on supporting cooperation even without direct attribution.\n\nThey also accept rewards from others when they arrive, and their subsequent behavior shows that receiving rewards does not immediately cause them to free-ride more aggressively; they sometimes continue to cooperate after benefiting. This is consistent with at least partial reciprocity or gratitude-like responding, though attribution is impossible in this setup, so any such reciprocity is diffuse rather than targeted.\n\nStrategically, they do not rely exclusively on rewards as their main tool: they alternate between rewarding and not rewarding while also varying their own contributions. This points to a nuanced approach in which rewards are one instrument among several for balancing personal gains and the maintenance of a cooperative environment. Overall, their reward persona is that of a moderate, selective rewarder who is willing to incur some cost to encourage or sustain cooperation, but who does not treat rewarding as an unconditional duty."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a conditional, moderately cooperative contributor who mixes full contributions with clear episodes of free-riding. They are comfortable both fully cooperating and fully defecting, and they switch modes multiple times rather than following a simple increasing or decreasing pattern. Their default in many situations is to contribute fully, but they are willing to withhold contributions even when others are generally cooperative, suggesting that maximizing own payoff and testing others’ willingness to carry the public good are both salient.\n\nThey appear sensitive to group behavior but not in a strict “mirror” way. They sometimes cooperate when several others are low or zero, and sometimes free-ride when most others are high. This suggests they track the general climate but do not tie their own action mechanically to any single fairness benchmark. There is no evidence of a strong equal-contribution norm; they tolerate persistent low contributors and do not systematically retaliate by dropping to zero every time others underprovide.\n\nThey accept payoff risk to cooperate: they frequently put their entire endowment into the public good even when it is clear that some players are chronic non-contributors. At the same time, they also demonstrate opportunistic behavior: at several points they keep their entire endowment while others sustain relatively high contribution levels, allowing them to earn very high payoffs. This pattern is consistent with a “conditional opportunist” who is neither a pure altruist nor a pure free-rider.\n\nOver time, their contribution pattern is volatile rather than smoothly trending. They oscillate between full and zero contributions across early, middle, and late phases, indicating ongoing experimentation or context-dependent decision rules rather than a fixed strategy. They appear comfortable with strategic inconsistency if it offers occasional high payoffs or information about others’ responses.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThe player shows clear horizon awareness but not a simple linear end-game defection. They continue to make full contributions well into the late game while others sometimes under-contribute, indicating that they do not shift into a pure “last rounds = always defect” strategy. Near the very end, however, they cluster multiple zero-contribution choices, including in the final round when group cooperation remains strong. This suggests that they recognize the absence of future interactions and are willing to exploit that when there is no longer any reputational or reciprocal benefit to maintaining contributions.\n\nTheir end-game behavior thus reflects a mixed motive: up to the final stretch they still invest in the public good, perhaps to sustain group benefits and maintain incoming rewards, but as the remaining-rounds count becomes very small they prioritize personal payoff and become comfortable free-riding on others’ continued cooperation. They do not escalate cooperation in the final rounds; instead, they allow their opportunistic side to dominate.\n\nBecause they had already received substantial rewards while occasionally defecting earlier, it is plausible (though not certain) that they believe others will keep cooperating and possibly rewarding even if they themselves reduce contributions at the end. Overall, their response to the end-game is best described as “late but not extreme unraveling”: they maintain some cooperation into the late horizon, then pivot to zero contributions once the future is too short for cooperative reinforcement to matter.\n\n<REWARD>\nThe player is generally willing to use the reward mechanism and does so repeatedly across the game. They spend on rewards in both cooperative and non-cooperative rounds, indicating that willingness to reward is not contingent on their own contribution level in that round. They sometimes reward while defecting, which suggests a separation between “how I behave right now” and “how I want to shape or acknowledge others’ behavior.” This points to a strategic or evaluative use of reward rather than purely reciprocal tit-for-tat.\n\nTheir reward behavior appears to be selective rather than indiscriminate. They do not spend on rewards every round, and they modulate the amount they spend. This indicates they are likely targeting players they perceive as especially cooperative or as key to maintaining high group contributions. They seem to accept the personal cost of rewarding as an investment in sustaining or amplifying others’ good behavior, consistent with a forward-looking, group-benefit-oriented use of the mechanism.\n\nThey also continue to reward in situations where their own contributions are low and others’ contributions remain relatively high, consistent with gratitude or an attempt to maintain a profitable cooperative environment while personally taking advantage of it. This is compatible with a “strategic benefactor” profile: they value a high-cooperation group, are willing to pay to support and encourage cooperators, but do not bind themselves to reciprocate via contributions in every period.\n\nOverall, this player’s “type” can be summarized as a conditional cooperator with opportunistic free-riding tendencies and an active, strategically minded use of positive incentives. They seek to preserve a cooperative environment through selective rewarding, while giving themselves flexibility to defect—especially when reputation or future rewards are less at stake, such as near the game’s end. Their social style is thus mixed: they are supportive and reinforcement-oriented toward cooperators, yet comfortable exploiting the public good at times when it appears safe or profitable to do so."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a “principled cooperator with occasional opportunism.” They treat full contribution as the default, repeatedly choosing the cooperative option despite mixed group behavior and without visible decay over time. Across most of the game they maintain a high, stable contribution level, suggesting they accept the social-efficiency logic of contributing even when some others free-ride. They show one clear deviation into free-riding early on, during a phase where others are contributing strongly, which indicates they are not a pure altruist; they are willing to exploit a cooperative environment at least once to test or benefit from it. However, they do not stick with this exploitative pattern, implying that free-riding is not their dominant strategy.\n\nTheir behavior appears only weakly conditional on short-term fluctuations in others’ contributions. They continue to cooperate even when a noticeable minority of players persistently contribute nothing. This points to relatively high tolerance for free-riding and a willingness to keep investing in the public good without requiring strict fairness. At the same time, they seem aware of contribution norms: they do not increase cooperation in response to others, but they avoid sustained deviation from the cooperative pattern themselves, which fits an internalized “I should do my part” norm more than a reactive tit-for-tat style.\n\nRisk-wise, they accept the risk of being exploited by low contributors repeatedly. There is no evidence of them trying to hedge by withdrawing contributions when cooperation falls. This suggests either a payoff-insensitive commitment to cooperation or a belief that long-run or group-level gains justify continued full contribution. Their one early defection indicates some payoff sensitivity, but their persistence in full contributions even afterward suggests that norm adherence or self-concept as “a cooperator” carries more weight than immediate material incentives.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThey do not exhibit a classic end-game unraveling of cooperation. Contributions remain at the cooperative level through the final rounds, with no late defection even when the horizon is very short. This indicates that knowledge of the remaining rounds does not substantially change their contribution behavior. They either discount the strategic logic of final-round free-riding or place higher value on maintaining a cooperative pattern to the end.\n\nTheir approach to the closing stages instead looks consistent and steady: they keep contributing fully despite knowing there is little time left to influence others’ future actions. This weakens the interpretation that their cooperation is primarily strategic or future-oriented and supports an interpretation of rule-based or identity-based cooperation (“I am a contributor regardless of stage of the game”). There is no sign that they attempt a last-moment payoff grab by suddenly free-riding, even though such a move would be highly profitable and unpunishable here. Thus, horizon awareness is present but does not translate into opportunistic behavior; they seem to prioritize internal consistency over end-game optimization.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey are “selective but willing rewarder,” using the reward mechanism intermittently rather than systematically. They clearly accept the idea of paying a personal cost to benefit others, but they do not reward every round and sometimes choose not to reward even when others are cooperating. This pattern suggests that they treat rewarding as a targeted tool rather than a standing obligation.\n\nThey appear to use rewards primarily to reinforce cooperation and possibly to reciprocate when they themselves are being rewarded. Their largest reward expenditures coincide with periods when they are receiving substantial rewards, consistent with a gratitude or generalized reciprocity motive: when they feel supported by the group, they are more willing to incur sizeable costs to support others. In contrast, when no rewards flow to them, they become more conservative in rewarding, sometimes not using the mechanism at all. This asymmetry points to an underlying conditional preference: they like reciprocity and mutual support, and their willingness to bear costs for others increases when they perceive themselves as beneficiaries of the group.\n\nThey do not appear to use rewards as a strict, fine-grained enforcement tool—there is no clear evidence of them carefully rewarding only perfect cooperators and withholding from marginal ones in a consistent way. Instead, their pattern fits a looser, emotionally or norm-driven reinforcement: reward is used in bursts and then dialed back, more like a signal of appreciation or solidarity than an optimized incentive scheme. They also never experiment with extremely high or zero reward levels for extended stretches, implying a moderate, balanced orientation rather than extreme generosity or extreme self-interest. Overall, they are cooperative in both contribution and reward domains, but their rewarding is more context-sensitive and reciprocity-driven than their near-constant willingness to contribute."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThe player is a mixed, opportunistic cooperator with a persistent willingness to contribute but no strict norm of consistency. They repeatedly choose the cooperative action even when others free-ride, yet occasionally defect to capture higher private payoffs. Their pattern alternates between full contribution and full free-riding rather than settling into a stable single mode, indicating low commitment to a fixed strategy and moderate volatility.\n\nThey clearly recognize that cooperation is locally beneficial to the group: they continue to contribute in environments where average contributions by others are already high or improving, and they do not switch to pure defection even after stretches of personal disadvantage from contributing. At the same time, they are comfortable exploiting cooperative environments: when others maintain relatively strong contribution levels, the player sometimes withholds their own contribution and benefits from the public pot, consistent with conditional cooperation that occasionally drifts into strategic free-riding.\n\nTheir contribution choices show no strong evidence of strict fairness enforcement. They tolerate the presence of persistent low contributors without systematically withdrawing cooperation, and they do not converge to a stable “only contribute when nearly everyone else does” rule. Instead, they appear to balance a preference (or willingness) for group efficiency with a clear concern for personal gain.\n\nRisk tolerance appears moderate. The player is willing to contribute even when some others are clearly defecting, implying they accept the risk of being “exploited” by free-riders. However, their intermittent defection suggests they are not willing to bear that risk indefinitely or unconditionally.\n\nOverall, the type is best described as a pragmatic, partly conditionally cooperative actor: they lean toward cooperation, are influenced by the cooperative climate, but are willing to defect opportunistically, especially once it is clear that cooperative contributions from others are robust.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nAwareness of the finite horizon does not lead this player to abandon cooperation. In the final portion of the game, including the last round, they continue to make high, fully cooperative contributions rather than collapsing into pure defection. There is no marked decay in cooperation as the end approaches; if anything, they sustain or return to full contributions after earlier episodes of free-riding.\n\nThis suggests either limited use of backward-induction reasoning or a preference structure where maintaining cooperation and group efficiency remains attractive even in the final rounds. It may also indicate a belief that others will continue to cooperate until the end, making contribution still profitable. The player’s behavior is thus horizon-aware in the sense that they know how many rounds remain, but their strategy does not implement a classic end-game defection cascade. They maintain a cooperative stance through the close, consistent with a type that does not strongly prioritize last-round exploitation.\n\n<REWARD>\nThe player never uses the reward mechanism, despite facing many opportunities where rewarding cooperators could, in principle, reinforce behavior or reciprocate benefits. This indicates a strong reluctance to spend private resources on rewarding others, even when the technology is favorable and despite personally receiving rewards on multiple occasions.\n\nTheir non-use of rewards holds across contexts: when others cooperate a lot, when they themselves contribute, and when they free-ride. They also do not use rewards to build reciprocity or to signal gratitude for being rewarded. This pattern suggests that they either (a) discount the effectiveness of rewards as a coordination or incentive tool, (b) treat reward spending as an unattractive cost regardless of social benefits, or (c) prioritize personal payoff over prosocial signaling in this dimension.\n\nBecause they sometimes cooperate but never spend on rewards, their social preference profile appears asymmetric: they are willing to bear private cost via contributions that benefit everyone (including themselves), but they are unwilling to bear private cost targeted at others’ payoffs. They thus behave as a non-rewarding, payoff-conscious cooperator: they may appreciate cooperation and group efficiency but do not invest in positive sanctions to shape others’ behavior. Their gratitude, if present, is not expressed through costly rewards."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a mostly-cooperative, mildly opportunistic type who anchors on contributing rather than free-riding, but does not follow a rigid moral rule. After an initial period of experimentation that includes both non-contribution and contribution, they settle into a pattern where contributing the full endowment is their default choice. They occasionally withhold their contribution, but these are isolated deviations rather than the main strategy.\n\nTheir behavior suggests they accept the efficiency logic of the public good: they act as though putting their own coins into the pool is generally worthwhile, even though the personal material incentive is to free-ride. They do not appear highly reactive to the exact level of cooperation around them; they are willing to contribute when others are mixing between contributing and not, and they keep contributing even when cooperation by others is not maximal or is fluctuating downward. This indicates a relatively low sensitivity to short-run exploitation risk and a moderate tolerance for being “more cooperative than some others.”\n\nAt the same time, they are not a strict unconditional cooperator. They do withhold contributions at scattered points, which may reflect opportunistic profit-taking, simple experimentation, or mild disappointment with others’ inconsistency. However, these free-riding choices do not escalate into a full defection cascade, implying that maintaining a cooperative self-image or norm is more important than maximizing every possible gain.\n\nThere is no clear evidence that they try to match others’ average contribution level in a fine-grained way; rather, they display a coarse pattern: “mostly contribute, occasionally defect.” Fairness concerns are present but appear limited; they plainly accept earning high payoffs when others are more generous toward them, but this does not lead to visible attempts to “balance the scales” via their own contributions. Their risk tolerance appears moderate: they are willing to risk being exploited by defectors for the sake of preserving cooperation, but not so committed that they never free-ride themselves.\n\nOverall, this is a “principled but not strict” cooperator: the default is to support the public good, with sporadic deviations that do not undermine a broadly cooperative profile.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThis player shows little to no end-game unraveling. Their contribution pattern near the horizon is similar to their pattern in the middle of the game: they continue to contribute the full endowment in almost all late rounds, with only occasional non-contribution that looks like part of their general opportunistic variance rather than a systematic final-round defection.\n\nTheir behavior indicates that they attend to the remaining-round information (it is visible in the interface) but do not convert that awareness into a sharply more selfish strategy as the game approaches its end. They act as if maintaining cooperation is still worthwhile even when there are very few rounds left and no future opportunities for reciprocity or reputation building within this game. This suggests that their cooperative choices are at least partly driven by stable preferences or internal norms rather than only by strategic future-oriented incentives.\n\nAny small late-game free-riding episodes appear indistinguishable from earlier ones and do not form a trend of decreasing cooperation. Thus, the player’s strategy is horizon-stable: they do not substantially decay or escalate cooperation in response to the approaching end; they largely keep doing what they have been doing all along.\n\n<REWARD>\nThis player never uses the reward mechanism at any point, despite facing many situations where others contribute substantially and even where they themselves receive substantial rewards from the group. They consistently leave the reward option unused, which points to a stable, deliberate stance rather than oversight or confusion.\n\nSeveral interpretations are consistent with this pattern. First, they may have a strongly payoff-maximizing view of the reward tool, judging the cost of rewarding as not worth the benefit to others, even when reward is slightly socially efficient. Second, they may view contributions as sufficient expression of cooperation, seeing extra reward as unnecessary or strategically ineffective when rewarders and punishers are anonymous and outcomes are not fully visible. Third, they may abstain because they perceive no reliable way to direct reward toward “deserving” individuals given anonymity and noisy contribution patterns.\n\nWhat is clear from behavior is that gratitude or reciprocity, if present, is not expressed through costly reward. Even when they are themselves the target of generous rewarding by others, they do not reciprocate through the same channel. This suggests that they separate their cooperative norm (“I will usually contribute to the public good”) from any obligation to engage in second-order cooperation via reward. They rely on first-order contributions as their main cooperative act and treat the reward mechanism as dominated or irrelevant for their purposes.\n\nIn a new environment, this type is expected to contribute to the public good with moderate reliability but to systematically ignore voluntary reward options, unless those options directly affect their own payoff in a clear and individually advantageous way."

Their contributions are maximally stable and show no volatility or contingent response to free-riding, partial cooperation, or shifts in overall group contribution levels.\n\nThey follow a simple, fixed rule: fully invest in the public fund every time. This suggests they prioritize the social optimum or a strong internal norm over individual payoff maximization. They do not appear to condition on fairness (others contributing less does not reduce their own contributions, and spikes in group cooperation do not increase them because they are already at the maximum). There is no evidence that they try to match, punish, reward, or strategically respond to particular peers’ patterns.\n\nGiven that the marginal per capita return is above 1 for the group but below 1 individually, this unwavering full contribution implies high tolerance for exploitation risk. They are willing to be taken advantage of by low contributors, at least within the confines of the game, and do not hedge or “test” the group. They behave as if the correct or expected thing is to cooperate fully, independent of short-term personal incentives.\n\nTheir behavior is consistent with a strong, possibly unconditional prosocial or rule-following orientation: once they understand that contributions benefit the group, they lock into the cooperative option and do not deviate. There is no observed learning curve or strategic experimentation; if learning happens, it is completed before or immediately at the start of observed play.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThe player shows no visible end-game effect. Their strategy remains unchanged when the game is near completion: they keep contributing fully even when the remaining number of rounds is small and when many others either maintain cooperative behavior or drop/oscillate. There is no sign of the typical cooperation decay, last-round defection, or even a mild reduction in contributions as the horizon approaches.\n\nThis suggests that they either do not factor the finite horizon into their strategy, or they choose to ignore it in favor of a fixed cooperation norm. They act as if the time horizon is irrelevant to what they “should” do. If they reason about the end-game, they still prefer to maintain a consistent cooperative identity rather than exploit the final rounds.\n\nOverall, they appear to be a time-invariant, principle-driven cooperator whose behavior is not strategically altered by approaching termination."

Their cooperation is stable and non‑conditional: they continue to contribute fully even when some others repeatedly free‑ride or experiment with low contributions, and even when group returns temporarily drop sharply. They do not exhibit strategic end‑game defection; they maintain the same maximum contribution through to the final observed round. This pattern suggests that they either (a) have internalized a simple dominant rule like “always contribute max,” (b) are highly payoff‑focused given the favorable multiplier and treat any withholding as irrational, or (c) are following instructions or norms from outside the game context rather than reacting to in‑game incentives in a nuanced way. Their behavior is consistent with a “committed unconditional cooperator” rather than a conditional cooperator or strategic free‑rider. Risk tolerance appears high: they keep investing everything into the public pot even in phases when others are clearly exploiting cooperators and when returns are more volatile. They do not appear concerned with short‑term relative disadvantage from free‑riders, focusing instead on maintaining the high group‑efficiency regime.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThey speak rarely and briefly. Early on, they endorse full contributions when another player asks about maximizing, aligning themselves with the pro‑cooperation norm. Much later, after a long stretch of silence, they ask a single clarifying question about the currency of conversion, indicating instrumental interest in the monetary outcome but not using that to argue for or against any strategy. They do not respond to the repeated accusations and jokes about a “green bird” being a tight player or a bot; given that their own contributions are consistently maximal and transparently visible, they might either not see themselves as the target, not care to correct the misperception, or simply avoid conflict. They make no attempts to shame low contributors, coordinate punishment, or negotiate contribution levels beyond that initial simple “yeah max” endorsement. Overall, their style is low‑talk, low‑drama, pragmatic, and minimally social: they engage just enough to signal that they are present and understand the payoff structure but do not join the emerging group politics or banter. Responsiveness to others’ content is limited; they neither argue about game theory nor try to persuade defectors to reform.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey show no explicit verbal reaction to others’ contributions or payoffs, whether cooperative or exploitative. When others free‑ride and earn more than the full contributors, this player does not complain, threaten to reduce their contribution, or express resentment. When the group returns to near‑full cooperation and everyone’s payoff rises again, they likewise do not celebrate or call attention to their own consistent behavior. They never reference specific players’ payoffs or accuse anyone of being greedy or unfair, even though the information is fully visible to them. Instead, their only evident “response” to changing group outcomes is to maintain their own strategy unchanged. This insensitivity to local payoff shocks and to social pressure implies that their type is best characterized as a stable, high‑cooperation rule‑follower who does not condition on others’ outcomes, rather than a reciprocity‑driven or norm‑enforcing player. Any emotional or evaluative reactions they might have to others’ outcomes remain unknown from the transcript; behaviorally, they simply keep maximizing their own and the group’s expected earnings under the given multiplier."

Their strategy is stable and non-contingent: they do not appear to condition contributions on others’ behavior, average group contribution, or relative payoffs. They sustain full cooperation even when it is clearly disadvantageous in individual payoff terms and when others frequently take the selfish option. This indicates a strong internal rule or norm (“I contribute fully”) rather than a responsive, payoff-maximizing calculus. There is no visible experimentation, no shift toward self-protection, and no attempt to match or mirror the majority. Fairness concerns, if present, do not translate into reduced giving; they tolerate being on the losing side of payoff comparisons without altering their action. Risk tolerance appears high with respect to exploitation risk: they persist with a contribution choice that repeatedly leaves them financially vulnerable to defectors. Because contribution is invariant across time and social conditions, their behavior is best described as principled or rule-based cooperation rather than conditional cooperation or strategic reciprocity. Their incentives seem weighted toward following a cooperative norm or maximizing group welfare in principle, even when the actual group does not reciprocate. Learning and adaptation are either absent or extremely limited within the observed window; new information about others’ tendencies does not modify their contribution decision.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThe player consistently accepts outcomes in which non-contributors earn more than they do, without any observable behavioral retaliation or payoff-protective adjustment. They keep cooperating even when non-cooperators systematically obtain higher payoffs. Because punishment and reward tools are unavailable, there is no direct evidence of how they would spend resources to influence others; however, their unchanged full cooperation in the face of repeated exploitation suggests low propensity for payoff-based retaliation and high tolerance for inequality when it arises from others’ selfishness. They do not engage in payoff matching: others’ advantage does not induce them to reduce their own contribution to restore parity. This implies that observing others’ outcomes influences them weakly, if at all, in terms of strategic adjustment. Their likely belief is that it is appropriate to maintain their cooperative stance independent of what others earn, or that changing behavior in response to others’ higher payoffs is not desirable. They exhibit no sign of conditional kindness (rewarding high contributors by increasing their own contributions) or conditional spite (reducing cooperation when facing free riders); instead, they follow a fixed cooperative rule that is robust to seeing both fair and unfair payoff distributions. Overall, they present as a steadfast, non-retaliatory cooperator whose behavior is largely insensitive to observed payoff patterns of others."

This suggests that they either hold a strong internal norm of contributing fully or follow a simple rule that does not condition on peer behavior.\n\nThey accept substantial payoff disadvantages relative to persistent free riders without altering their behavior, indicating low sensitivity to payoff inequality and a willingness to be exploited rather than defect. This pattern implies relatively low payoff-risk aversion at the individual level: they consistently sacrifice secure private returns to support the group outcome, even when it is clear that many others do not do the same. They appear to prioritize the social efficiency of full contribution (given a high multiplier) over their own relative earnings.\n\nThe player does not display conditional cooperation in the usual sense. Their contributions do not track the average contribution level of the group, nor do they reward cooperative peers or punish defectors via their own contribution decisions.

Any fairness norms they may hold are not enforced through contribution withdrawal; they tolerate others taking higher private payoffs while they continue to invest for the group.\n\nBecause the choice set is restricted to all-or-nothing, it is unknown whether they would fine-tune contributions in more granular environments or use more nuanced reciprocity.

This indicates that, in practice, they do not retaliate, compensate, or otherwise react strategically to others’ payoff outcomes. They show no evidence of behavioral response to the presence of systematic exploitation: no drift toward self-protection, no apparent attempt to match others’ low contributions, and no visible concern with equalizing payoffs.\n\nBecause explicit punishment and reward mechanisms are disabled, there is no direct evidence of how they would spend resources to change others’ payoffs if given the option. However, their continued willingness to accept disadvantage while still cooperating is consistent with a low tendency to engage in payoff-targeted responses, whether punitive or rewarding; they appear not to condition their actions on who gains or loses in prior periods.\n\nThey also do not appear to selectively support high contributors versus low contributors through their own behavior; everyone benefits equally from their full contributions, regardless of past actions. This suggests that, if they form judgments about others, those judgments do not translate into differentiated treatment within the constraints of this game. Their implicit stance can be summarized as: maintain cooperation independent of others’ outcomes, even when those outcomes are clearly unequal and sometimes unfavorable to themselves. Their emotional or cognitive reactions to these inequalities are unknown; only the behavioral side—robust non-response in terms of strategic adjustment—is evident."

They always allocate their entire endowment to the public fund and never deviate, regardless of how others behave or how their own payoff compares to freeriders. This pattern indicates a strong internal cooperation norm that does not adjust to declining average contributions in the group.\n\nTheir behavior is consistent with valuing social efficiency over individual payoff: contributing fully is payoff-dominated by freeriding at the individual level, yet they persist even when it is clear that many others do not. They appear tolerant of exploitation and do not display negative reciprocity in contribution decisions. There is no evidence that they condition on past group behavior or attempt to match, exceed, or undercut others’ contributions; instead, they follow a fixed rule of “always contribute maximum.”\n\nFairness norms are present but appear to be prioritized at the group-level outcome (maximizing the joint return from the public fund) rather than at the individual-level distribution of payoffs. They continue to cooperate even when this generates clear payoff inequalities in favor of consistent freeriders. This suggests that, if they hold fairness concerns, these are either (a) second-order to their cooperation norm, or (b) oriented toward efficient outcomes more than payoff equality.\n\nRisk tolerance is relatively high in the social sense: they repeatedly expose themselves to the risk of being the “sucker” in the presence of noncooperation. There is no observed hedging or experiment with the selfish option. Their strategy shows no exploration; instead, they commit to a single prosocial choice and maintain it.\n\nInternally, this pattern is most compatible with a “principled cooperator” or “moral cooperator” type: they behave as if cooperation is the right action independently of what others do. It is unknown whether this is driven by pure altruism, strong social norms, a desire to maximize total welfare, or adherence to an experimenter/“good participant” norm; the transcript does not disambiguate these motives.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThe player observes repeated instances where noncontributors earn higher payoffs than themselves, as well as variation in others’ contribution patterns. Despite this, they do not change their own behavior or attempt any strategic response via available mechanisms; they maintain full contributions without any punitive or rewarding actions (with the caveat that no formal punishment/reward tools are available in this game).\n\nTheir nonreaction in terms of behavior suggests low behavioral sensitivity to outcome inequality and exploitation. They do not appear to engage in payoff-based reciprocity—there is no shift toward self-protection when others benefit from their cooperation without contributing. Likewise, there is no attempt to align with emerging group norms (which are more selfish than their own stance). Instead, they persist with their initial cooperative policy.\n\nThere is no direct evidence of emotional responses (such as anger or disappointment) because there is no chat and no available punishment/reward. However, inferred from their unwavering contributions, they either (a) downplay or accept payoff differences as part of playing cooperatively, or (b) prioritize adherence to their own cooperative standard over correcting others’ behavior.\n\nIn summary, when faced with others’ higher or lower payoffs, the player continues to act according to a stable cooperative rule rather than adapting to reduce inequality, punish freeriders, or reward cooperators. Their type is best characterized as a steadfast, efficiency-oriented cooperator with low observed responsiveness to others’ payoff outcomes."

This suggests either a strong fairness/efficiency norm that they follow regardless of others, or a belief that maintaining full cooperation is still the best response even in a partially free-riding group. They show high tolerance for payoff inequality to their own disadvantage, continuing to cooperate as others gain more by contributing less.\n\nRisk-wise, they accept the personal risk of being exploited and do not hedge by partially lowering contributions. Instead of experimenting or adapting, they lock into a simple, extreme strategy. There is no evidence of exploratory behavior or concern with maximizing own payoff under the given multiplier; they appear primarily motivated by cooperative or moral principles rather than outcome optimization.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThis player shows no end-game defection or decay in cooperation. Awareness of the finite horizon does not lead them to reduce contributions. Their behavior is time-consistent: they treat the final interaction the same as earlier ones, even after observing others shifting toward more self-regarding strategies over time.\n\nThis suggests they either (a) ignore standard end-game logic on principle, (b) place intrinsic value on acting cooperatively independent of future consequences, or (c) possibly misunderstand or disregard the strategic implications of the last round. Based solely on actions, they appear to follow a rule like “always fully contribute” rather than recalculating near the end. They do not escalate or retaliate when approaching the final round; their cooperative stance remains stable and uncompromising.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThis player continues to fully contribute even as others obtain higher payoffs by contributing little or nothing, indicating strong tolerance for being out-earned and no observable envy-driven response. They do not attempt to protect themselves against free riders by reducing cooperation, despite clear evidence that some group members benefit disproportionately.\n\nThey do not differentiate between moderately cooperative and strongly uncooperative peers in their subsequent behavior; outcomes showing others doing very well through low contributions do not alter their strategy. There is no sign of reactive adjustment based on observed payoff distributions, suggesting either low sensitivity to relative earnings or a deliberate choice to prioritize their cooperative norm over distributional concerns.\n\nBecause there are no punishment or reward tools available, their direct response is limited to changing contributions, and they choose not to use that channel for sanctioning or signaling. Their type therefore looks like a non-conditional, non-sanctioning cooperator who accepts unequal outcomes as the cost of adhering to a personal cooperation rule. Beliefs about others’ intentions or fairness concerns remain unknown beyond what is implied by their unchanging cooperation."

Their pattern indicates that they prioritize group efficiency over individual payoff, even when others systematically free-ride and when it is clear that contributing yields them strictly lower individual earnings than defecting.\n\nThey do not display conditional cooperation: their contributions do not track the average contributions of others, nor do they react to declines in group cooperation. This suggests that either (a) they adhere to a strong internal norm of always contributing, or (b) they follow a simple, pre-committed strategy not updated by experience. There is no evidence that they experiment with defection or mixed strategies.\n\nThey tolerate being exploited by free riders without changing their own behavior. This points toward a fairness or efficiency preference that is not implemented in a reciprocal way—if they care about fairness, they do not use their contribution decision to enforce it. Instead, they behave like a pure cooperator in a one-shot sense, every round.\n\nIn terms of risk, they accept the “risk” of systematically lower individual payoffs to maintain maximum public good provision. Given the parameters of the game, full contribution is individually irrational but socially optimal, so their behavior is consistent with strong pro-social or rule-following tendencies and low sensitivity to short-term material losses relative to internal principles.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThe player’s cooperation is insensitive to others’ payoffs and contribution patterns. As others alternate between relatively cooperative and more free-riding profiles, including periods where free riders earn strictly more than contributors, the player does not adjust. They neither reduce their contributions to avoid being exploited nor appear to reward cooperative phases by increasing from a previously lower level; their behavior is flat.\n\nThey observe that some players systematically benefit from contributing nothing while still receiving substantial returns from the group. Despite this, they do not respond by imitating the profitable strategy or by withdrawing their own support. This suggests that either they do not prioritize payoff comparison, or they do but choose not to act on it. There is no evidence of emotional reciprocity (retaliation, “teaching a lesson,” or strategic forgiveness) because they never change their action in response to others’ outcomes.\n\nBecause there is no punishment or reward mechanism available in this environment, we cannot observe how they would allocate costly sanctions or bonuses; their latent willingness to punish defectors or reward cooperators is unknown.

They repeatedly choose the maximum contribution even when many others free-ride and even when this leaves them systematically earning less than low contributors. Their behavior is highly stable over most of the game, with a single deviation at the end.\n\nThey follow a simple, coarse strategy: contribute fully as a default, independent of short-run payoff disadvantages, and maintain that choice across changing contribution patterns of others. There is no clear evidence of gradual conditional cooperation or tit-for-tat style adaptation; the player does not scale their contribution up and down in response to marginal changes in group behavior. Instead, they keep contributing fully across stretches where the environment alternates between relatively cooperative and relatively uncooperative.\n\nThe late switch to non-contribution indicates they are not a rigid pure altruist: they are willing to try defecting after sustained periods of earning less than many free-riders. This suggests they notice and care about payoff comparisons and are at least somewhat payoff-sensitive. However, this shift occurs only once and only after many cooperative choices, implying a high tolerance for disadvantage before they act on self-interest.\n\nFairness and efficiency norms appear to influence them strongly. Their long streak of full contributions, despite others’ repeated free-riding, is consistent with a robust internal standard that “everyone contributing” is the appropriate behavior and that contributing is worthwhile because the group return per contributed coin is high. They behave like someone who sees full contribution as the default “correct” action and only reluctantly tests free-riding when that norm is repeatedly violated by others.\n\nRisk tolerance appears moderate-to-high in social terms: they are willing to expose themselves to exploitation risk by persistent full cooperation in a mixed group. They do not hedge (for example, by alternating between contributing and withholding) and instead commit to a clear cooperative stance. The single late defection suggests they may switch to more self-protective behavior under continued evidence that the group will not align with their cooperative norm, but the transcript is too short to know if that switch would persist in future rounds (unknown).\n\nOverall, this player fits a “stubborn cooperator with late, tentative defection” type: they primarily aim for group efficiency and normatively “right” behavior, and only secondarily adjust toward personal payoff protection, and even then, minimally.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThe player repeatedly observes that some others obtain higher payoffs by contributing nothing or less, yet they continue to contribute fully for most of the game. This indicates a muted immediate reaction to payoff disadvantage: they do not quickly mimic successful free-riders, nor do they appear to condition their own choice tightly on who benefited most in the prior outcome.\n\nThey show a willingness to keep cooperating even when low contributors consistently earn more, suggesting that inequity aversion (if present) is initially overridden by their cooperative or norm-following motives. However, the eventual choice to free-ride after many such experiences shows that inequity and repeated observation of others’ advantageous outcomes do matter over time. Their late defection plausibly reflects accumulated frustration or learning that the group will not converge to high, symmetric contributions, pushing them to protect their own payoff at least once.\n\nBecause no punishment or reward is available in this environment, we cannot observe any explicit sanctioning or compensating behavior (unknown). There is also no direct evidence of targeting specific peers, since their contribution choice affects everyone symmetrically. However, their sustained full cooperation in the presence of visible, repeated free-riding indicates a relatively forgiving or patient social style: they do not immediately retaliate against others’ non-cooperation by switching off their own.\n\nIn sum, when others gain from free-riding, this player initially responds by staying cooperative and absorbing the disadvantage, signaling a strong internal cooperation norm and social tolerance. Only after repeated exposure to such outcomes do they temporarily align their action with the dominant self-interested pattern, indicating that observed payoff structures eventually influence their behavior, but only with delay and only modestly in this setting."

This indicates that immediate self-interest and strict payoff maximization are not their primary decision criteria.\n\nTheir contribution rule appears simple and rigid rather than contingent on others’ recent behavior. They do not adjust downward in response to persistent free riding, nor upward (beyond the already-maximal level) in response to higher cooperation. This suggests a strong internal norm or heuristic in favor of contributing everything, rather than a calibrated conditional-cooperator rule such as “match others’ average” or “cooperate only if enough others do.” Because they always select the cooperative option, their risk tolerance with respect to exploitation is high: they repeatedly accept being vulnerable to systematic free riding by others.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, they accept inequitable outcomes in which non-contributors consistently earn more than contributors. They do not respond by defecting to close this payoff gap, which implies that equalization of material payoffs is not an overriding motive. Instead, they prioritize maintaining the public good itself or adhering to a moral/strategic principle of cooperation. There is no evidence of strategic deviation near the end of the game, suggesting they are not using backward induction or end-game thinking in any observable way.

However, their willingness to keep cooperating despite persistent free riding suggests they are unlikely to favor harsh, payoff-correcting responses; they appear more focused on sustaining contribution than on disciplining defectors or selectively incentivizing cooperators. Their behavior provides no indication of tracking specific individuals’ outcomes for reciprocation or targeted response; they treat the group as a whole and maintain their cooperative stance regardless of how advantageous the situation is for particular others. Overall, they react to others’ higher or lower earnings with behavioral inertia: they register these outcomes enough to see that exploitation is possible but do not let it redirect their own strategy."

There is no observable sensitivity to changes in the average contribution of others, to shifts in the balance of cooperators vs. freeriders, or to repeated evidence that contributing yields them a lower personal payoff than defecting would. This suggests that payoff-maximization is not their primary decision rule, at least in this context.\n\nThey accept a payoff structure where freeriders often earn more than they do, continuing to contribute fully. This indicates a willingness to tolerate exploitation and an apparent prioritization of collective efficiency over their own relative earnings. They behave as if they endorse a norm that “everyone should contribute fully,” but there is no indication that they condition their own behavior on whether that norm is met.

This suggests they accept the cooperative norm and are comfortable giving up the private endowment when they expect the group to do the same. Their contributions do not collapse over time; they repeatedly return to full contribution after deviations by others, so they do not display strong conditional cooperation in the sense of punishing defectors by systematically lowering their own contributions.\n\nAt a few points they contribute nothing despite high or near-unanimous contributions from others. These choices are infrequent and not followed by any explanation in chat, but they coincide with periods when overall cooperation is already strong and when the player is not being singled out in discussion. This pattern is consistent with occasional strategic free-riding: taking advantage of others’ contributions once a high-cooperation norm is established, while relying on the fact that no explicit sanction or tracking mechanism exists.\n\nThey do not verbally advocate for any contribution rule, do not try to enforce fairness norms, and do not publicly criticize low contributors. Their behavior suggests they internally value the higher payoffs from mutual cooperation but are also attentive to personal payoff maximization and willing to defect quietly when the social or reputational cost appears low. Risk tolerance appears moderate: they are willing to continue contributing even when some others defect, implying they are not highly loss-averse about “wasted” contributions, yet they also hedge with a few free-riding moves rather than naively contributing every time.\n\nOverall, their strategy is: “Contribute fully by default to preserve the cooperative environment and enjoy large group returns, but occasionally exploit the public good in a low-visibility way for extra personal gain,” without openly challenging or reinforcing norms in communication.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThis player’s communication is minimal, polite, and socially oriented rather than strategic. They offer a brief greeting at the start, explicitly state that they are a human participant when prompted, and later answer a casual, off-topic question about having eaten. They do not initiate discussions about strategy, incentives, or fairness, nor do they join others in trying to coordinate on contribution rules.\n\nThey never pressure others to contribute, never complain about low contributors, and never praise or thank high contributors. This indicates an avoidance of leadership or enforcement roles and a preference for blending into the group. They respond when directly or implicitly invited into simple social exchanges but otherwise remain quiet, suggesting a low-visibility, low-conflict engagement style.\n\nTheir tone is neutral to friendly, with no sarcasm, insults, or strong emotional expression. They show no evidence of trying to manipulate others’ beliefs about the game or the payoff structure, and they refrain from participating in the more intense norm-enforcement or joking that others engage in. Communication appears to serve identity confirmation and light social presence rather than coordination or persuasion.\n\nIn sum, they engage enough to appear cooperative and “present,” but they strategically stay out of any debates or norm-setting conversations, keeping a low profile that matches their mostly cooperative but occasionally opportunistic contribution behavior."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThe player is generally pro-cooperative but opportunistic. They strongly endorse full contribution in group discussion early on and initially match this with consistent full contributions. Over time, they occasionally free-ride by contributing nothing while others maintain full cooperation, but they do not push this into systematic exploitation; most of the time they still contribute fully even when it would be profitable to defect. Their pattern suggests conditional cooperation plus some strategic experimentation with defection when they expect the group to remain cooperative without sanctions. They show moderate risk tolerance: they defect a few times despite having previously suggested that defection should be punished, indicating a willingness to test the limits of the norm they helped establish. Fairness norms appear present but flexible: they promote “all contribute” as the ideal and benefit from mutual cooperation, yet they are willing to deviate when there is no visible social or monetary cost.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThe player adopts a friendly, informal, and engaging tone. They actively initiate coordination around full contribution and explicitly frame cooperation in terms of group profit maximization. They also engage in light social chat (age, joking about another’s username) which suggests a desire to build rapport, not just to optimize payoffs. They question the usefulness of deduction early on and later try to influence others’ behavior around rewards, arguing that certain prosocial actions are not payoff-optimal. They are responsive to others’ messages and adapt their comments (e.g., addressing a specific teammate by name to suggest a change in behavior). Overall, they communicate as a sociable, mildly strategic coordinator who is comfortable persuading others but does so in a relaxed manner.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThere is no visible end-game unraveling in their contributions: they continue to contribute fully to the public good through the final rounds rather than switching to pure defection as the horizon approaches. Reward behavior continues as well, including in the last round, suggesting that they do not sharply change strategy based on the game’s impending end. Any subtle horizon awareness is unknown; behavior is broadly stable, with a mix of cooperation and occasional reward right up to the final round.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey never use the punishment option, despite having suggested early that non-contributors should be punished by everyone. This gap between stated norm (supporting punishment for defectors) and behavior (never actually punishing) indicates either a strong aversion to incurring costs for negative sanctions, a preference for “soft” norm enforcement via talk and rewards, or a reevaluation of punishment’s value once the efficiency costs are clearer. There is no evidence of retaliatory motives, targeted deterrence, or spite; their approach to punishment is complete abstention.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nThey are never punished, so their reactions to being punished, or to identifiable punishers, are unknown.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey are willing to reward others, but selectively and intermittently. They first use rewards in a generous, broadly distributed way, rewarding all others who are cooperating, which aligns with a desire to acknowledge group-wide contribution and perhaps to foster goodwill. Later, they reassess and explicitly argue that using rewards is not payoff-beneficial, after observing another player’s repeated rewarding. Even after articulating this cost-benefit concern, they still occasionally reward individuals, often when others also appear to be engaging in rewarding. This pattern suggests mixed motives: they understand that rewards are not materially advantageous, but still use them occasionally for social signaling (gratitude, friendliness) or reciprocal prosociality. They never use rewards as a contingent “if-then” response to specific deviations; instead, rewards primarily follow cooperative stability and social liking, not strict strategic reinforcement.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThey are rewarded multiple times by others but never explicitly comment on being rewarded, nor do they explicitly condition their own rewards on who rewarded them. Some of their rewards go to players who also use rewards, but the transcript does not clearly distinguish reciprocity from general friendliness. Their internal attitude toward rewarders (e.g., gratitude, alliance-formation) is therefore uncertain; observable behavior shows at most weak, indirect reciprocity and no explicit verbal acknowledgment.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey pay attention to payoff-relevant mechanics and others’ spending. They question the value of deduction early, implying sensitivity to net payoff effects. Later, after observing a teammate repeatedly spend on rewards, they openly advise against continuing that behavior on grounds that it does not improve one’s own payoff, indicating that they monitor others’ costs and resulting payoffs enough to judge efficiency. They also casually remark on others’ behavior (e.g., joking about another’s pattern or name), but do not express annoyance or moral condemnation when others free-ride or overspend on rewards. Instead, they provide gentle, rationale-based guidance (e.g., “you don’t gain anything from it sadly”). Overall, they notice others’ outcomes and choices and respond with soft influence rather than moralistic or punitive reactions."

They show no responsiveness to changes in others’ behavior or to shifts in the group’s average contribution; their chosen level remains constant despite large variation around them. This indicates low conditionality and a weak or absent reciprocity norm: they do not reward high contribution by increasing their own, nor do they punish low contribution by decreasing it. They appear to prioritize a balance between earning individually and not looking like the worst cooperator, rather than maximizing collective welfare. Their behavior is consistent with a payoff-focused, individually rational type that is willing to free-ride partially while maintaining a moderate cooperative “signal.” Risk tolerance appears limited: instead of experimenting with higher or lower contributions as the game unfolds, they stick to a safe, pre-chosen rule.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nAwareness of the finite horizon does not alter this player’s behavior. There is no visible end-game defection spike or cooperative “last stand”; the contribution rule they use remains unchanged through the final period.

They treat each round similarly, indicating low sensitivity to the number of remaining rounds and little interest in timing their cooperation or defection.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThis player observes that some peers consistently contribute much more and earn less, while others contribute much less and earn more, yet they do not adjust in response to these outcome patterns. They neither move toward the high-contribution norm of the more cooperative players nor toward the lower-contribution strategy that yields higher payoffs for free-riders. This suggests limited social comparison and weak payoff-driven learning within the short game. They do not appear motivated to match others’ payoffs, correct perceived unfairness, or retaliate against low contributors through their own behavior. Their stance toward inequality is behaviorally neutral: they tolerate both others’ disadvantage (high contributors earning less) and others’ advantage (low contributors earning more) without changing their own strategy. Emotional reactions and underlying beliefs about fairness or trust are unknown; only a behavioral pattern of persistence and low reactivity to others’ outcomes is evident."

There is one clear, deliberate deviation: they exploit the final round by contributing nothing while everyone else contributes the maximum. Earlier, there is at least one instance where others notice they “almost” missed the full-group contribution, suggesting a brief timing/attention issue rather than a strategic defection, as their recorded contribution that round is still maximal. Overall, their pattern fits a “cooperate throughout, defect at the very end” strategy: they prioritize group efficiency for most of the horizon, then take a pure payoff-maximizing action when reputation and future reciprocity no longer matter. They show no visible concern about intra-group fairness beyond their own consistent cooperation; they tolerate others’ temporary confusion or low contributions without retaliating via their own contributions.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThey communicate very little and almost never initiate coordination. Their only notable chat is a short, playful response when another player calls out that they nearly ruined perfect group coordination, and they respond with a light-hearted, self-aware remark. They neither explain strategy nor correct others’ misunderstandings, leaving that role to more vocal players. Their tone is humorous and relaxed rather than defensive or apologetic, even when others teasingly monitor their behavior. This suggests they are socially attuned enough to engage in banter but prefer low verbal engagement and do not take a leadership or persuasion role. They do not use chat to threaten, shame, or pressure defectors, and they do not explicitly justify their final-round defection. Overall, their style is minimally talkative, socially easygoing, and non-confrontational.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThey demonstrate clear horizon awareness. When other players explicitly note that only a small number of rounds remain, this player continues to contribute fully through the penultimate round, maintaining cooperation while mutual benefit is still meaningful. In the very last round, however, they abruptly switch from full contribution to complete free-riding while everyone else still contributes maximally. They do not alter their reward behavior at the end (they never reward at any time), but they do change their contribution strategy exactly when future repercussions are impossible. This pattern indicates an end-game defection consistent with standard backward-induction logic in public goods games: they are willing to behave cooperatively across repeated interactions but revert to purely self-interested behavior when the game cannot continue and when social sanctions (formal or informal) no longer matter.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey never spend any resources on rewarding others, despite being repeatedly rewarded themselves. This holds in high-cooperation phases and in mixed phases with partial defection by others. Their behavior suggests that they do not treat the reward mechanism as a useful strategic tool for sustaining cooperation, nor as an avenue for expressing gratitude. They appear content to free-ride on others’ willingness to fund positive incentives: they benefit from a cooperative environment and occasional rewards without making any direct material investment in reinforcing it. Whether this is driven by indifference to the reward mechanism, a deliberate payoff-maximizing choice, or simple inertia is unknown, but functionally they behave as a non-rewarder throughout.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThey receive small amounts of reward across many rounds from multiple others, including during early mixed-cooperation phases and during stable full cooperation. There is no evidence that they respond to specific rewarders in any targeted way: they do not start rewarding anyone in return, nor do they publicly thank or acknowledge generosity in chat. Their contributions remain consistently high regardless of whether they are rewarded or not, so their cooperative behavior does not appear to be reinforced or altered by receiving rewards. They neither build visible “alliances” through reciprocal rewarding nor differentiate between generous rewarders and non-rewarders in their own actions. The best description is that they are reward-insensitive in behavior: they accept rewards passively but do not modify strategy in response.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey observe others’ outcomes—including extreme generosity in some players’ reward spending and occasional free-riding in contributions—but show no explicit, strategic response. They do not punish free-riders through lower contributions or reduced cooperation; instead, they maintain full contributions even after seeing that some players keep all their endowments. They also do not “reward the rewarders” despite seeing some players spend substantial amounts boosting others’ payoffs. Their only social reaction visible in the transcript is a playful message after being called out for almost undermining collective success; they respond with humor rather than with concern over relative payoffs or reputational damage. There are no signs of envy or resentment toward those who earn higher payoffs by defecting, nor of moralistic reactions to over-generous or under-generous strategies by others. Overall, they appear behaviorally tolerant and unreactive: others’ payoff patterns, reward expenditures, and contribution deviations do not visibly change their own choices, aside from their own planned final-round defection."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is mostly a high contributor once they understand the structure, but with some early and occasional defection. They begin by free-riding when others are coordinating toward full contributions, but explicitly state confusion about whether they have contributed, suggesting the initial non-cooperation is at least partly due to misunderstanding rather than a clear exploitative intent. After receiving explanations from others, they settle into a stable pattern of full contributions for the majority of the game, even when some others sometimes defect and even in the final round. They do not appear to condition their own contributions strongly on others’ most recent behavior: they keep contributing fully through mid- and late game, including when some players free-ride and when end-game temptations are present. They seem willing to sacrifice individual payoff for group efficiency once the norm is clear, and they remain cooperative even when marginal incentives in the very last round would favor defection. Their behavior is more consistent with a “confused early learner who becomes a norm-following cooperator” than with a calculating conditional cooperator or persistent free-rider.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nTheir communication is sparse, reactive, and mostly informational. They respond to others rather than initiating coordination. Early on, they openly admit confusion about whether they have contributed, and later reiterate that they find the situation confusing, which indicates low strategic sophistication or comfort with the interface and rules. They follow others’ guidance on how to play rather than pushing their own interpretation or norms. They also join light social talk (e.g., sharing country) when that emerges, showing willingness to engage socially but not to drive the conversation. Their tone is neutral to mildly affiliative; there is no evidence of criticism, blame, or attempts to pressure free-riders. Overall, they are a low-talk participant who is honest about not understanding, receptive to group guidance, and not confrontational.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThey are explicitly informed how many rounds remain via the interface, and other players mention the approaching end, but there is no observable shift toward selfishness on their part near the end. They continue to contribute fully in the last rounds, including the final one, even as at least one other player defects in the very last round. Their reward spending does not show a dramatic strategic escalation or shutdown either; it remains low and similar in pattern to their earlier behavior. This suggests they either do not apply backward induction or do not prioritize it over maintaining the established cooperative norm. They appear to treat late rounds much like earlier ones, indicating a stable cooperative disposition that is not strongly sensitive to the finite horizon.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey are generally reluctant to spend on rewards. Across the game they spend only small amounts on rewarding others, and in many rounds they give no rewards at all, even when almost everyone is cooperating at maximum. When they do reward, it is modest and spread, which fits a limited, possibly symbolic use of reward rather than a strong strategic investment to shape behavior. Given that others are already near-universally cooperative and there is no punishment, they may see little need to spend to enforce norms. They are also a frequent recipient of small rewards from others, but they do not respond by matching that generosity on a large scale. Their reward behavior looks more like “occasional thanks or conformity to a minimal norm of acknowledging cooperators” than a deliberate tool for incentivizing group behavior.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThey repeatedly receive small, positive rewards from others, including in early rounds when their own contribution pattern is not perfectly cooperative. There is no clear pattern of targeted reciprocity: they do not shift into heavy rewarding of those who reward them, and they do not significantly increase their reward spending in response to being favored. Their small reward outlays appear weakly related, at best, to whether they themselves were rewarded; the behavior is more consistent with a generally low propensity to reward combined with occasional gestures rather than forming alliances or tit-for-tat reciprocity. If anything, they accept rewards passively and continue their own low-reward, high-contribution strategy without strong adjustment to who has supported them.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey pay attention enough to notice their own status and express confusion about whether they have contributed, implying some monitoring of outcomes, but they do not comment on others’ payoffs, reward costs, or apparent exploitation. They do not publicly criticize free-riders, praise generous rewarders, or otherwise react in chat to the visible heterogeneity in others’ costs and gains. Even when one player spends extremely heavily on rewards and others remark on this, they remain silent about it. Their behavior suggests a focus on their own understanding and participation rather than on judging or steering the group based on observed outcomes. They adapt their own contributions toward the cooperative norm but do not visibly use outcome information to sanction, reward selectively, or express moral approval/disapproval. Overall, they behave as a quiet norm follower: they internalize the cooperative pattern once they comprehend it, but they leave others’ outcome disparities largely uncommented and unaddressed.\n\n"

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThe player fits a “conditional, profit‑sensitive cooperator” type with substantial within-game variability. They often choose the socially efficient contribution (putting in their full endowment) but also occasionally free‑ride completely or give moderate amounts. Their pattern is not monotonic over time; instead of a steady decline, they oscillate between high and zero contributions. This suggests they pay attention to others’ behavior and their own payoffs and are willing both to support and to exploit the group depending on context.\n\nThey clearly understand the incentives: they repeatedly choose the individually dominant free‑riding option in some rounds and the fully cooperative option in others, which is consistent with deliberate, not random, choice. They are willing to incur substantial personal cost to boost the public fund in many rounds, indicating at least a partial internalization of cooperative norms or a desire for group success, but they do not follow a strict fairness rule (they sometimes take much more than they give relative to others).\n\nTheir conditionality appears asymmetric: they do not systematically “punish” low contributions by consistently dropping to zero afterward, nor do they rigidly match others’ levels; instead they sometimes cooperate strongly even when others are mixed, and sometimes free‑ride even when others are contributing a lot. This suggests a mix of opportunism and periodic recommitment to cooperation rather than a clean reciprocity rule like “match the group average.” Risk tolerance toward “wasted” cooperation is moderate: they are willing to contribute fully even when there is clear evidence of repeated free‑riding by others, but not in every such situation.\n\nOverall, the contribution profile is: often high, sometimes zero, occasionally intermediate, with choices that appear purposeful and payoff-aware rather than random or purely altruistic.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThe player speaks very little and uses a brief, cooperative tone. At the outset they explicitly endorse a proposal for full cooperation. This aligns with a willingness to coordinate and appear prosocial in front of the group. After that, they do not initiate further strategic discussion or challenge others’ behavior. They do not confront low contributors, call out “wolves,” or respond to the mild social commentary in the chat. This indicates a low-engagement, non-confrontational communication style.\n\nThey show no evidence of trying to persuade defectors back into cooperation, and they do not publicly justify their own shifts between high and zero contributions. There is no visible attempt to signal conditionality or to threaten future behavior through words. Instead, they let their actions speak for themselves. Their social style in chat is “quiet supporter”: they initially express agreement with cooperative norms, then withdraw from discussion and focus on play rather than conversation.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThe player shows no classic “end‑game collapse” pattern. In the final segment of the game, they repeatedly choose the fully cooperative contribution, including in the very last decision. This suggests that awareness of the approaching end does not push them toward pure short‑term self-interest. Instead, they either remain aligned with cooperative norms or find it instrumentally appealing to continue contributing even when there are few or no future rounds for reciprocity.\n\nBecause their contributions fluctuate earlier and then stabilize at high levels near the end, they might be using a simple heuristic like “finish strong/cooperative,” or they might be indifferent to the finite horizon implications. There is no visible attempt to “cash out” by defecting in the last round once future retaliation is impossible.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThe player observes detailed feedback about others’ contributions and payoffs and clearly adapts somewhat, but their reactions are mixed. They do not comment on others’ earnings in chat, do not shame low contributors, and do not explicitly praise high contributors. They also do not systematically align their contributions with any one subgroup of players. Instead, they sometimes exploit high-contributing groups by free‑riding and sometimes join them with full cooperation.\n\nTheir alternation between free-riding and contributing suggests they are sensitive to the payoff consequences of others’ behavior: when others are generous, free‑riding is very profitable, and they occasionally take that option; when they value group returns or perhaps reputation or self-image more, they revert to full contributions. However, there is no clear evidence that specific payoff patterns or specific individuals’ outcomes drive these changes; the mapping from observed outcomes to their behavior is noisy. Their response to others’ outcomes can be summarized as “quietly opportunistic but periodically prosocial,” without explicit social enforcement via communication."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a volatile, strategically mixed contributor who oscillates between full free-riding and very high contributions. Contributions span the entire range from zero to the full endowment, with many intermediate values and no simple linear trend. The player is clearly sensitive to context, but their rule is not a simple “match others” or “always cooperate/defect” pattern.\n\nThey sometimes fully exploit cooperative environments by contributing nothing while many others contribute a lot, securing very high payoffs. At other times, in similarly cooperative environments, they contribute the full endowment or nearly all of it. This indicates that payoff-maximization is salient but not the only driver; they are willing to incur substantial personal cost to contribute when they choose to, even when others’ cooperation is already high.\n\nThey does not adhere to a strong fairness norm like equalizing contributions. They often take advantage of high contributors without compensating later in a systematic way. Yet they also voluntarily join cooperative surges with large contributions, which suggests a situational willingness to support group efficiency rather than a pure selfish type.\n\nConditionality is present but noisy. The player seems more willing to contribute high amounts when others are visibly cooperating; however, the same cooperative environment sometimes elicits zero contributions from them. This inconsistency suggests exploration, opportunism, or mood-based decision-making rather than a rigid reciprocity rule.\n\nRisk tolerance appears moderate to high in social terms: the player is willing to contribute fully even when some others are clearly defecting, accepting the risk of being exploited. At the same time, they also take opportunistic low-risk free-rider positions when cooperation is robust, indicating comfort with both cooperative and exploitative strategies.\n\nOverall, the contribution profile fits a “flexible opportunistic cooperator”: someone who understands the gains from public contributions and takes part in them, but is also willing to defect when it looks especially rewarding or when they feel like it, without strong evidence of guilt or strict norm-following.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThe player remains completely silent in the chat throughout the game. They neither initiate nor respond to any messages, including direct or indirect normative appeals and coordination attempts from others. This indicates a low-engagement or deliberately observant communication style.\n\nThey do not attempt to persuade, negotiate, or justify their contribution choices, even when their actions diverge starkly from cooperative suggestions in the chat. This suggests they either do not prioritize maintaining a positive social image in this setting or they assume anonymity makes such concerns irrelevant.\n\nThe lack of reactive chat, even when others discuss “wolves,” zeros, and selfishness, implies that the player either does not feel compelled to defend or explain themselves, or prefers to keep their intentions opaque. Their style is non-confrontational by omission: they neither criticize others nor praise them.\n\nFrom this transcript alone, it is unknown whether their silence reflects shyness, strategic opacity, disinterest in social interaction, or simple focus on payoffs. What is clear is that they do not use communication as a tool for coordination or norm-enforcement.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThe player shows no clear collapse of cooperation in the final rounds; instead, they maintain or increase high contributions near the end. Their last few decisions include multiple very high contributions, including near or at the maximum, despite the known finite horizon and the absence of future punishment or reward.\n\nThis pattern suggests that they does not follow the canonical backward-induction logic that would dictate more defection near the end. Instead, they either treat end-game rounds similarly to mid-game ones or even lean into cooperation when the end approaches.\n\nThere is no visible attempt to “cash out” by sharply lowering contributions in the final opportunities. This indicates either a preference for maintaining or signaling a cooperative stance through the end, a stable internal preference for contributing when in that mindset, or a lack of strong horizon-based planning.\n\nOverall, the player’s end-game response is to continue a mixed but often generous strategy, rather than to exploit the final rounds.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThe player observes detailed feedback on others’ contributions and payoffs every round, but does not verbally comment on them. Behaviorally, they sometimes exploit others’ high contributions by choosing zero and earning high payoffs while others earn less, and at other times they accept lower payoffs by contributing heavily alongside cooperators.\n\nThere is no evidence that they directly reward or punish others, and in this setting no formal reward or punishment mechanism exists. Their indirect “punishment” or “reward” via contributions is inconsistent: they does not systematically increase contributions to help previously exploited players, nor do they consistently reduce contributions in response to any specific individual’s behavior.\n\nThe player tolerates being exploited as well: they sometimes contribute heavily while some peers free-ride and reap higher payoffs. They do not visibly retaliate in a targeted way against these apparent free-riders; subsequent choices alternate between high and low contributions without a clear link to specific others’ payoffs.\n\nTheir reaction to group-level outcomes seems more aggregate and opportunistic than personalized. They appear comfortable in environments where some get much more or less than others, without trying to correct or stabilize those disparities. Emotionally or normatively, their stance toward others’ outcomes is unknown; behaviorally, they accept both being exploited and exploiting others as part of the game, without explicit complaint or compensation."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a generally high contributor with moderate downward flexibility. Their typical choice is to give a substantial portion of their endowment, often above the group average, but they do not rigidly stick to full cooperation. They alternate between full and partial contributions rather than drifting into persistent free-riding. When group contributions fall, they reduce their own giving somewhat but maintain clearly cooperative levels instead of retaliating to the minimum. When the group appears more cooperative, they respond by sustaining or increasing their own contributions rather than exploiting. They show some concern for personal payoff, as seen in occasional lower contributions, but overall prioritize group efficiency and fairness. Their pattern suggests conditional cooperation with a relatively high personal standard and moderate risk tolerance for being exploited: they are willing to keep giving even when others free-ride, but they do not maximize personal income by systematically under-contributing.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThis player is mostly quiet and observant, engaging minimally in chat. They do not initiate coordination early, nor do they try to organize or enforce group norms during the main part of the game. They show no evidence of confronting specific individuals, persuading them, or joining ongoing joking/teasing dynamics. Their sole explicit statement is a brief self-reflective comment near the end, where they characterize the group (or possibly themselves) as “selfish,” indicating that they are monitoring the social environment and have a moral or evaluative lens on cooperation. The tone of that remark is resigned rather than aggressive; it does not attempt to shame or rally others, just to acknowledge the situation. Overall, they lean toward low-visibility, low-conflict participation: they cooperate behaviorally but do not try to lead, argue, or negotiate.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nAwareness of the finite horizon does not push this player into a clear cooperative collapse. In late rounds, their contributions fluctuate but remain mostly high, including fully cooperative decisions very near the end. They do briefly lower their contribution just before the final round, which increases their own payoff substantially, suggesting some strategic attention to personal earnings as the game concludes. However, they then immediately return to full contribution in the final round even though the game is about to end and others’ behavior offers an opportunity to free-ride. This combination indicates mixed motives: they balance payoff maximization with a persistent cooperative norm, and they are not purely backward-inducting. The self-referential comment about selfishness appears in the final round and coincides with them choosing to contribute fully, which implies that, despite recognizing or anticipating selfish behavior around them (or in themselves earlier), they end the game reaffirming a cooperative identity. Overall, their end-game strategy shows only mild decay and some internal tension between norm-following and self-interest.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThis player is clearly attentive to the broader outcome structure but does not react in a strongly punitive or vengeful way. When others earn more through low contributions, they do not sharply retaliate by dropping to minimal contributions. Instead, they adjust moderately, staying within a cooperative range. They also do not engage in chat to call out specific high-earning free-riders, even when payoff differences are salient. Their later behavior suggests that seeing others benefit from selfishness does not fully erode their willingness to contribute; they sometimes even increase contributions after such patterns. Their one explicit evaluative comment about selfishness indicates they interpret outcome patterns through a fairness lens, but they internalize this mostly as observation rather than as a trigger for active sanctioning. In sum, they are a tolerant, mildly conditional cooperator: sensitive to inequity and exploitation, but reluctant to escalate or withdraw cooperation solely in response to others’ advantageous outcomes."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a generally high contributor who aims for group cooperation but adjusts contributions in response to perceived free-riding. They contribute well above what a purely self-interested player would, often close to or at the maximum, and rarely choose very low amounts. Their pattern shows conditional cooperation: they sustain generous contributions when others also give, and they scale down when they see repeated zero or very low contributions from several players. They do not, however, retaliate fully by dropping to the minimum; even when others appear selfish, they continue to put in a moderate-to-high amount, suggesting a mixture of pro-social preference and self-protection. Their choices are somewhat volatile but within a band of relatively cooperative behavior rather than swinging between extremes of full defection and full cooperation. They appear to hold an informal fairness norm that others “should” contribute something nontrivial, and they register visible frustration when several players give nothing. They tolerate some inequality but show sensitivity when non-contribution seems systematic. Overall, this is a “conditional high cooperator with mild frustration,” not an unconditional altruist and not a strict payoff maximizer.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThe player uses chat sparingly but instrumentally. Early on, they explicitly attempt to coordinate the group toward full cooperation, directly proposing that everyone contribute all of their endowment. This indicates awareness of the social optimum and a willingness to lead coordination efforts. Their tone is concise and informal, including brief corrections of their own typos, which suggests comfort but not heavy investment in social bonding. They engage in light, playful teasing when another player asks who is behaving selfishly, but they do not escalate or moralize harshly. When cooperation deteriorates, they make a short, critical comment about others’ repeated low contributions, indicating that they track patterns and feel entitled to question non-cooperators. They respond to others’ thematic chat (e.g., the “wolf”/predator motif) with brief agreement and participation, but they do not drive the humor. Overall, they engage selectively, mainly to coordinate and to signal disapproval of perceived selfishness, rather than to chat for its own sake.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThis player shows no strong evidence of standard end-game defection. They remain cooperative through the final phase and often increase or maintain high contributions near the end. Their contributions in the last few rounds are among their higher levels, including near-maximum and maximum choices. They do not appear to exploit the finite horizon by cutting contributions when only a few rounds remain; instead, they continue to support the public good as long as others also seem to be contributing substantially. This suggests either limited strategic focus on backward induction or a preference structure where maintaining cooperation and/or fairness is more salient than squeezing out final-round earnings. Horizon awareness is present at the game level (config states they can see rounds remaining), but from behavior alone, there is no clear sign they use that information to strategically reduce cooperation; if anything, they double down on a cooperative or pro-social self-image toward the end.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThe player clearly observes how others are behaving and earning, and they react more to others’ contribution choices than to explicit payoff numbers. When others contribute nothing for multiple periods, they verbally call this out, implicitly criticizing those players’ strategy as selfish. They also engage with a running theme of “wolf” or “selfish” behavior, lightly accusing another player when asked who the selfish one is. However, their behavioral response is measured: they reduce their own contributions when they feel exploited but never to the extreme of full defection for extended stretches. Instead, they seem to seek a balance where they protect themselves from being too exploited while still participating in group gains when others step up. They do not display targeted reciprocity toward specific individuals; because they see all contributions, they react to the overall contribution climate rather than tailoring their behavior to particular players. Emotional tone in response to outcomes is mild irritation rather than strong anger or vindictiveness. Absent punishment or reward tools, they use their own contribution level and occasional critical comments as their main levers to respond to others’ outcomes and strategies."

They consistently give a mid-level amount relative to their endowment and maintain that level across rounds, even when others express clear support for maximal contribution. Their behavior suggests they understand that higher group contributions increase everyone’s payoff but choose a personally safe, “middle” level rather than risking full cooperation. They do not condition their contribution strongly on specific others (e.g., the free rider); they neither escalate generosity to inspire them nor cut back in protest. Fairness norms appear present in words (encouraging higher giving) but only weakly implemented in actions, indicating a mild preference for self-insurance over strict equity. Risk tolerance in contribution is moderate: they are willing to contribute nontrivially but avoid the extreme cooperative choice.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThey are socially engaged, friendly, and informal, greeting the group and using humor and self-deprecation. They actively encourage collective cooperation, framing higher contributions as a way for everyone to benefit. They try to coordinate the group toward higher giving and echo others’ cooperative proposals, yet do not personally match the proposed level. They are responsive to emerging topics (e.g., non-contributors, light political joking) and participate in group banter without hostility. Their style shows comfort with group interaction and a desire to belong, using inclusive language and affirming others’ comments. They do not confront specific players aggressively and avoid direct blame, opting instead for general encouragement and agreement with others’ critiques. Overall, they engage rather than withdraw, using conversation to build a cooperative narrative even when their own choices are more cautious than their rhetoric.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThey show awareness that the game has multiple rounds and talk as if planning for future cooperation, but they do not adjust their own contribution upward in the final available opportunity. Their messages imagine continued play and future coordinated contributions even when no further round actually occurs, indicating either inattention to the precise horizon or a default habit of thinking in repeated-game terms. There is no visible “end-game defection spike” in their behavior; instead, they simply maintain their earlier mid-level pattern. This points to weak horizon-driven strategizing: they conceptually support sustained cooperation over time, but their actual decisions do not reflect a distinct end-of-game optimization.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey observe that the group’s contributions are generally high and express approval and enthusiasm about that, treating strong cooperation as socially desirable. They verbally push for even higher group contributions after seeing that cooperation pays off, implying a basic understanding of the payoff structure and group benefits. When it becomes clear that at least one player is persistently free riding, they align socially with those criticizing that behavior but do not escalate into direct hostility; their tone remains more joking and political in flavor than punitive. They do not have access to formal punishment or reward tools in this setting and show no attempt to create informal sanctions beyond light agreement with others’ complaints. Their main adjustment to observed outcomes is rhetorical rather than behavioral: they talk more about everyone contributing fully but keep their own contributions at the same cautious level. This pattern suggests that seeing free riders and payoff differences affects their commentary and group alignment more than it changes their personal strategy."

They are not purely self-sacrificing; they balance own payoff with group returns and sometimes keep a substantial portion despite others’ full cooperation. Their behavior indicates awareness that high group contributions are profitable, but they are willing to deviate downward when they can still benefit from others’ generosity. Contribution choices are somewhat volatile but within a narrow band (medium vs. maximum), hinting at experimentation or mild strategic adjustment rather than random play. They appear comfortable taking advantage of a cooperative norm at times, but not to the extreme of contributing nothing. Their risk tolerance is moderate: they repeatedly invest heavily even after seeing others defect or fluctuate, implying they are willing to risk being the “sucker” occasionally to preserve or regain high group payoffs.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThe player communicates very little and only engages once the group has already established a norm and called attention to their behavior. They respond briefly and directly when someone questions their contribution, using a short reassurance that implicitly acknowledges group expectations and seeks validation. They do not initiate coordination proposals, explanations, or persuasion; they let others lead the norm-setting discussion. Their tone is cooperative and non-confrontational; there is no sign of irritation or defensiveness, and they appear willing to align with the group once attention is on them. Overall, they adopt a low-visibility, reactive communication style: they monitor the chat, intervene minimally, and only speak when socially prompted.\n\n<REWARD>\nThe player uses rewards sparingly and selectively. They are willing to spend on rewards but do so infrequently, suggesting that they reserve rewarding for specific situations rather than routine reinforcement. Their first use of rewards occurs in a context where cooperation is already very high, indicating that they may use rewards more as a signal of appreciation or encouragement than as a tool to change poor behavior. They do not systematically reward every instance of strong cooperation, nor do they appear to run a consistent “reward-the-highest-contributor” strategy. They receive rewards in several cooperative contexts, which may reinforce their sense that contributing relatively high amounts is socially approved, but their own rewarding does not clearly escalate in response. Overall, they show a moderate willingness to reward, with no evidence of targeted strategic reinforcement or explicit gratitude signaling beyond the bare act of rewarding itself. Their reward behavior suggests they tentatively support prosocial norms but prioritize conserving their own payoff over actively incentivizing others."

The player explicitly states that they have reversed the intended action and later apologizes; this makes it plausible that some low contributions during a period of group encouragement toward full contributions stem from misinterpretation rather than calculated free-riding (medium confidence).\n\nOnce they appear to understand the norm and mechanics better, they shift to consistently contributing their full endowment in the later phase of the game, aligning with a cooperation norm promoted by others. This indicates conditional cooperation: they are willing to bear substantial cost to match the group’s apparent consensus once they feel responsible for earlier deviations and once expectations are clear.\n\nTheir contribution pattern is volatile early on and stabilizes later. They oscillate between full contribution, partial contribution, and taking everything, which is inconsistent with a simple selfish or pure altruist type. The change toward stable full contributions following apologies and peer clarification suggests they update based on perceived group expectations and their own sense of having made a mistake.\n\nFairness norms appear to matter: when they perceive that the norm is to “put everything in,” they later try to align their behavior with that standard. They show no evidence of exploiting others once they understand the cooperative expectation, and they tolerate the personal risk of over-contributing relative to at least one slightly under-contributing peer. Risk tolerance regarding payoff variance is moderate to high: they are willing to forgo secure private payoffs in favor of matching a cooperative strategy that depends on others continuing to contribute.\n\nOverall, the player is best characterized as norm-following once norms are understood, with early deviations driven by confusion, not stable selfishness.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nTheir tone is friendly, polite, and deferential. They initiate a greeting once they notice the chat and respond in a socially appropriate, upbeat way, fitting a cooperative social style rather than a hostile or confrontational one. They later express explicit apologies and self-blame for previous misaligned actions, indicating concern about others’ perceptions and a desire to repair group trust.\n\nThey use chat primarily for social alignment and clarification rather than for persuasion or strategic manipulation. When other players advocate for full contributions, the player does not lead or argue; instead, they express that they had misunderstood and then quietly adjust behavior. This indicates a responsive rather than directive communication style.\n\nThey are attentive and reactive to group feedback. When another player indirectly criticizes low contributors and confusion emerges about who is at fault, the focal player queries their own status (“I am ?”) and later explains that they had reversed the meaning of the decision. This suggests they monitor how others interpret actions and care about being seen as cooperative.\n\nThey do not engage in explicit coordination proposals of their own but willingly endorse and follow others’ proposals once they understand them. They show no signs of trolling, sarcasm, or hostility. The overall communication style is conciliatory, self-correcting, and socially sensitive, with a mild tendency toward embarrassment when they realize earlier mistakes.\n\n<REWARD>\nThe player shows limited, somewhat puzzling use of the reward mechanism. On one occasion they spend a substantial amount of their own payoff to distribute rewards, even when rewards are cost-neutral at the margin. This suggests an attempt to actively encourage cooperation or express approval, but the pattern is too sparse to establish a stable “strong reciprocator” type (low confidence).\n\nThey otherwise almost never use rewards, even when others behave cooperatively. This could indicate that they either do not fully understand or notice the reward stage, or they do not view the reward tool as necessary or impactful. Given they explicitly mention reversing the contribution decision and show confusion about mechanics in general, miscomprehension of the reward’s role is plausible (medium–low confidence).\n\nThey do not appear to use rewards strategically to shape future group behavior in a consistent way, nor do they systematically reciprocate when others reward them. The scarce use of the mechanism suggests that their primary cooperative tool is direct contribution itself, not indirect reinforcement.\n\nIn summary, their reward behavior is best described as sporadic and non-systematic, likely driven by a vague sense of encouragement or approval rather than a clear, calculated incentive strategy."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a generally high contributor with one clear deviation. They usually give the full endowment, even when others start defecting, suggesting a baseline cooperative or efficiency-oriented inclination. Their contributions are not mechanically unconditional, however: after making a costly cooperative move that is not reciprocated via reward, they temporarily switch to free-riding. This indicates conditional cooperation influenced by perceived social reciprocity, not just contribution levels. They explicitly reference the payoff logic later, recognizing that defectors can earn more when others continue to contribute, so they understand the strategic incentives and are not simply naïve. Despite this awareness and explicit peer pressure to defect at the end, they continue to contribute fully, implying some combination of fairness concern, mild social anxiety about defecting, and a tendency toward “doing the proper thing” even when others suggest otherwise. Their behavior is somewhat volatile early on (switching once to zero), but then stabilizes to full contributions, showing fast adaptation and then commitment to a cooperative pattern.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThey are active and engaged in chat, with a mix of emotional expression, mild sarcasm, and playful humor. They openly share their frustration when their initial generosity via reward is not reciprocated, using a somewhat dramatic, self-pitying tone that signals hurt feelings and a desire for mutual recognition. They participate in norm-enforcement talk, aligning with others who criticize non-contributors, including a brief call to “get” a perceived free-rider, hinting at a punitive or at least sanctioning attitude despite the absence of formal punishment. They also use humor and light teasing to maintain social rapport, and they engage in meta-commentary on the game (noticing player exits, referencing the game horizon, and joking about other avatars). When facing a coordination dilemma at the end, they explicitly voice “decision paralysis” and attempt to negotiate a side deal (offering to cooperate in exchange for being rewarded), suggesting both social dependence and strategic bargaining. Overall, they are socially engaged, responsive to others’ comments, and comfortable using chat both for coordination and emotional venting.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThey are clearly aware of the finite horizon and explicitly acknowledge when the last round arrives. Unlike the classic end-game defection pattern, they do not shift to non-contribution at the end; instead, they experience genuine internal conflict about whether to defect when others urge everyone to stop contributing. They express this conflict directly and try to resolve it socially by tying their decision to potential rewards. Ultimately, they continue to contribute fully in the final round even though prominent others advocate zero contributions, suggesting that end-game awareness does not fully override their cooperative or norm-following tendencies. Their final-round behavior looks like a mix of conditionality (they seek assurance or reward) and an underlying reluctance to join a collective defection even when it is strategically justifiable.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey exhibit a strong initial willingness to reward, to the point of making a very large and personally costly reward investment early on. This is done before having any evidence of reciprocal rewarding from others, suggesting a hopeful attempt to create or signal a cooperative reward norm rather than a purely reactive strategy. When no one rewards them back, they immediately conclude that rewarding is “pointless” and stop entirely for the rest of the game. From that point on, they never spend on reward again, even when later rewarded by others. This pattern indicates that their reward behavior is driven by expectations of mutual reciprocity and social recognition: once those expectations are violated, they withdraw from the reward system completely. They also later try to use reward strategically as a bargaining chip (“you reward me and I will…”), showing that they treat rewards as a possible tool for contingent cooperation, not just as moral praise.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThey are rewarded by others in at least one round but do not respond with reciprocal reward. There is no evidence of them acknowledging specific rewarders in chat, thanking them, or building an explicit alliance based on rewards. Given their earlier verbalization that rewarding is useless because no one rewarded them back, it appears that once they form this negative belief, they generalize it and ignore subsequent positive signals. Thus, their reciprocity via reward is asymmetric: they are willing to initiate rewarding in hopes of a rewarding norm, but once disappointed, they do not re-engage even when others start to reward them. This implies low propensity to form dyadic, reward-based alliances; instead, they treat the reward environment in a more global, binary way (“worth it” vs “not worth it”), with limited nuance or updating based on individual-level behavior. Emotional acknowledgment of being rewarded is absent or unknown.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey pay attention to who contributes and who does not, and they also track group size and exits. They join in the informal condemnation of low contributors, encouraging others to “get” them and echoing the narrative of certain players being the problem. They comment on the changing composition of the group (noting when someone disappears) and on shifts in contribution patterns, including the rise of free-riding and the resulting payoff advantage for defectors. They explicitly analyze the payoff dynamics, recognizing that those who contribute nothing can get higher payoffs when others continue to contribute, yet they also distinguish between short-run and long-run consequences when discussing the math with others. They adopt a somewhat moralistic, resigned tone toward free-riders (“some people just want to watch the world burn”), blending normative judgment with an understanding of strategic incentives. Overall, they are outcome-aware, sensitive to fairness and reciprocity, and their attitudes toward others are shaped strongly by perceived contribution behavior and the presence or absence of mutual rewarding."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a high, mostly unconditional contributor who occasionally experiments with self-serving deviations. For most of the game, they give either the full endowment or very close to it, even when one group member persistently contributes very little. Their behavior shows a strong cooperative baseline that is not tightly conditioned on exact fairness or full reciprocity from all group members.\n\nThey are not perfectly rigid: they reduce their contribution a few times, including at least one sharp drop. These deviations do not become a new stable pattern; they return to high contributions afterwards. This suggests opportunistic testing or short-run self-interest rather than a committed switch to defection.\n\nThey tolerate inequality: they keep contributing a lot despite one clear low contributor and without any visible coordination to punish or isolate that player. They appear more focused on sustaining group provision with the reliable high contributors than on enforcing strict fairness norms on everyone.\n\nRisk tolerance is moderate-to-high in social terms. They consistently expose themselves to the risk that others might reduce contributions later, yet they keep cooperating. Economically, they do not exploit the individually rational strategy of free-riding for most of the game. This implies a cooperative orientation or prosocial preference rather than pure payoff maximization.\n\nOverall, their contribution profile fits a “cooperative but occasionally opportunistic” type: they default to strong cooperation, are robust to some free-riding, but are not entirely immune to short-term temptation as the game unfolds.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThey never send any chat messages and never respond directly to others’ comments, despite sustained attempts by others to coordinate and express appreciation. This indicates a silent, non-engaging communication style: they observe others’ talk but do not participate.\n\nThe lack of verbal coordination, combined with consistently high contribution levels, suggests they treat the game as an individual decision problem rather than as a social negotiation. They allow others to set the cooperative norm in chat but follow or adjust based on observed actions, not on conversation.\n\nTheir silence is not clearly hostile or supportive; it is more neutral/withdrawn. They do not publicly endorse the cooperative norm, do not complain about free-riders, and do not express gratitude when rewarded. This makes them socially opaque to others: they contribute like a strong cooperator but do not signal intentions or emotions verbally.\n\nResponsiveness to others’ communication is unknown in content terms; however, their behavior loosely tracks the group pattern (staying mostly aligned with the high contributors), which suggests they are at least paying attention to outcomes and possibly inferring norms indirectly from others’ talk.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThey are aware of the game horizon, as the interface displays remaining rounds, but they do not show a steady cooperation decay as the end approaches. They continue to contribute at or near full even when very close to the final round, including in the last round itself.\n\nThere is one marked low contribution late in the game, but it does not trigger a sustained shift to defection in subsequent rounds. Instead, they quickly revert to high contributions, including at the end. This pattern does not match a classic end-game unraveling strategy; it is more consistent with a one-off deviation or exploration.\n\nThey do not appear to condition their last-round behavior on reciprocal expectations or “last chance” exploitation. Their final-round choice aligns with their early-game cooperative mode, indicating either a stable internal norm of contribution or low salience of finite-horizon strategic thinking.\n\nIn summary, their strategy is only weakly shaped by end-game incentives; they maintain substantial cooperation rather than exploiting the final period.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey never spend any coins on rewarding others, even when others contribute maximally and express appreciation in chat. This shows a strong reluctance to incur personal costs for positive sanctions in this institutional setting.\n\nGiven the cost-benefit structure of reward (costly and efficiency-reducing from an individual standpoint), their behavior is consistent with self-interested evaluation of the reward mechanism: they are willing to cooperate via contributions but not willing to spend additional resources to reinforce others’ cooperation.\n\nThey receive rewards multiple times but do not reciprocate with reward spending, even toward those who likely rewarded them or consistently contributed highly. This absence of observable rewarding suggests they do not use reward as a strategic tool for alliance-building, reciprocity, or norm enforcement.\n\nThey rely entirely on their own contribution choices to influence outcomes and never attempt to shape others’ behavior via the reward mechanism. Their incentives appear to prioritize preserving their payoff over actively supporting or thanking others financially.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThey are rewarded on several occasions, but their subsequent behavior shows no clear change in contribution pattern that can be directly linked to being rewarded, and they never reward anyone in return. There is no observable direct reciprocity in the use of the reward mechanism.\n\nTheir contributions remain generally high before and after receiving rewards, so it is unclear whether reward has any motivational effect beyond what their baseline cooperative preference already dictates. Any internal feeling of gratitude is behaviorally invisible: they do not respond in chat and do not repay via rewards.\n\nIf they recognize specific rewarders, this recognition does not manifest as targeted behavioral changes (either extra contributions or reward-giving). Their response to being rewarded is thus best characterized as neutral in terms of observable strategy—no retaliation, no alliance formation, no signaling.\n\nOverall, they behave as a cooperative contributor who is largely indifferent, at least behaviorally, to the reward system and does not engage in explicit reciprocal rewarding."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player fits a “talk-cooperative, mildly opportunistic” type. They show a strong initial willingness to fully cooperate, contributing their entire endowment even when others do not all match that level. They appear to internalize and endorse a full-contribution norm once it is discussed, actively supporting it in chat. However, their behavior is not perfectly stable: after explicitly signaling an intention to contribute the maximum, they then contribute less than that statement. This suggests some readiness to quietly deviate from a stated cooperative norm when it benefits them and when sanction risk appears low or ambiguous. Their contributions are clearly conditional on group discussion and perceived agreement; they do not unilaterally reduce contributions in response to others’ moderate deviations but do show that their stated intentions and actual actions can diverge. Fairness norms are present in their language (supporting equal, maximal contributions for everyone), but their revealed preferences indicate a willingness to shave their own contribution while still benefiting from others’ higher giving. Risk tolerance appears moderate: they are willing to contribute fully when they believe the group is aligned, but later reduce contributions in a context of emerging uncertainty about adherence to the norm and about the use of punishment. Overall, they are cooperative-leaning but not strictly norm-following, capable of small-scale free-riding when the opportunity arises.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThey communicate in a brief, directive, and highly coordination-focused style. Early on, they propose concrete contribution levels and quickly escalate their recommendation to a clear, maximal standard, emphasizing group uniformity. Their tone is enthusiastic and emphatic rather than cautious or analytical, favoring decisive statements over detailed reasoning. They actively engage with others’ suggestions, quickly aligning with proposals that move toward higher cooperation, and they visibly confirm agreement in real time. They also provide short explanations about their own action constraints (such as timing issues), indicating a concern with how others perceive their reliability and intent. Their engagement is social but instrumental: messages are aimed at securing a common plan and maintaining a sense of joint commitment. They do not challenge or criticize others directly and avoid confrontation in chat, even when others’ statements may be inaccurate relative to actual contributions. This points to a preference for positive coordination and face-saving rather than policing or calling out discrepancies publicly.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey never use the punishment option, despite being in situations where others contribute less than the emerging full-cooperation norm and despite explicit discussion by another player about using deductions as a sanction for low contributors. Their non-use of punishment persists when free-riding is observable and when a credible argument for norm enforcement is raised. This suggests either a reluctance to spend personal resources on enforcement, a general aversion to punitive actions, or uncertainty about whether punishing is appropriate or effective in this environment. They also do not join in the rhetorical push for punishment; they neither endorse nor oppose it explicitly. There is no evidence of retaliatory motives; they are not punished by others and never respond with punishment. Their pattern fits a “non-punishing cooperator” type: they prefer that norms be supported via communication and mutual agreement rather than through costly sanctions, and they tolerate some deviation without enforcing deterrence.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey observe that others sometimes earn more than they do and that contributions and payoffs vary across players and rounds, yet they show no explicit emotional or strategic reaction in chat to these differences. They do not comment on others’ higher or lower payoffs, nor on the absence of punishment across the group. When another player misperceives the group’s behavior as fully cooperative, they do not correct this, even though the payoff information reveals deviations. This indicates a low tendency to publicly scrutinize or contest outcome distributions. Their one ex-post comment is about their own process constraint (a timeout), not about fairness or inequity. Taken together, this suggests that they accept realized outcomes with minimal overt response, prioritize maintaining a cooperative narrative over highlighting discrepancies, and refrain from outcome-based blame or enforcement, even when they could potentially justify it. Their learning from outcomes is opaque from the data: they do adjust their own contribution, but they do not articulate that adjustment in terms of observed payoffs, leaving their internal updating process unknown or low-confidence."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThe player is a generally high, near-unconditional cooperator. They almost always contribute the full endowment, deviating to free ride only rarely and without clear strategic timing. Their cooperation persists despite repeated exposure to group members who sometimes withhold contributions. They do not systematically match others’ lower contributions nor escalate defection when others free ride; instead they continue to put in the maximum most of the time. This suggests they follow a simple cooperative heuristic rather than a finely tuned conditional strategy.\n\nTheir willingness to keep contributing when some others do not indicates tolerance for inequity and a relatively low aversion to being the “sucker” in the short term. There is no sign that they are experimenting with contributions to probe others’ behavior; deviations from full contribution are isolated and not followed by evident pattern shifts. They seem to value group-efficiency norms or “doing the right thing,” even when the immediate personal payoff is not maximized.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThe player communicates sparsely and in a light, self-deprecating, affiliative tone. When directly called out by another player, they respond immediately, defending their cooperative record but in a nonconfrontational way and with a touch of humor. They also explicitly express willingness to align with a group plan once they believe they understand it, signaling deference to group norms and a desire to conform rather than to lead.\n\nThey do not initiate strategic coordination proposals; instead they react to others’ initiatives. When confused about whether they are meeting expectations, they openly voice uncertainty, suggesting low defensiveness and a preference for clarity in social evaluation. Overall, they show engagement when socially addressed but avoid any aggressive or directive communication, favoring harmony and reassurance over argument.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThe player shows no strong “end-game defection” pattern. Their contributions remain high through the final rounds, including when others increasingly defect from contributing. There is no visible attempt to exploit the last rounds for personal gain by withholding contributions. If anything, they maintain or even double down on cooperative behavior despite clear signals that a subset of others is not fully cooperating.\n\nThis suggests limited horizon-based strategizing: they either do not leverage the known game length in their decision process or they choose to ignore its strategic implications in favor of stable cooperative norms. Their reward behavior also does not show a clear shift toward self-focused hoarding as the game nears completion; although variable, it remains nonzero and sometimes quite generous late in the game.\n\n<REWARD>\nThe player is a frequent, sometimes heavy user of the reward mechanism. They are clearly willing to incur costs to reward others, and they do so across many rounds. Their rewards consistently flow toward apparent cooperators and never toward clear defectors when behavior is easy to classify. They use rewards to reinforce full contributions and to support those who seem to be carrying the public good.\n\nTheir reward giving is not strictly proportional or perfectly stable: the magnitude of reward they send fluctuates. Nonetheless, the underlying principle seems to be: support group members who contribute, especially when others are also cooperating. They sometimes spend substantial amounts on rewards even when it is personally expensive relative to the immediate gain, which points to a prosocial or norm-enforcing motive rather than narrow payoff maximization.\n\nThere is no evidence they use reward in a retaliatory or manipulative way (e.g., no “withholding reward” as an explicit punishment in chat, no “bribing” language). Instead, their use of reward looks like positive reinforcement of cooperation and maintenance of goodwill.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThe player frequently receives rewards from others and appears to reciprocate at least at the group level, although specific dyadic reciprocity patterns cannot be determined with certainty from the aggregate summaries. They do not verbally thank or call out particular rewarders, so any reciprocity is behavioral rather than explicitly signaled in chat.\n\nTheir continued willingness to reward others after having been rewarded themselves is consistent with a generalized reciprocity or “pay it forward” style rather than targeted alliance formation. There is no overt attempt to create exclusive sub-coalitions; their rewards are distributed among multiple cooperators over time. They do not display resentment when rewarded less than others, nor do they respond by visibly cutting off rewards to people who previously rewarded them less. Overall, they treat rewards as mutual reinforcement of a cooperative atmosphere, not as a strict tit-for-tat exchange.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThe player appears attentive to others’ outcomes, but their reactions are mostly implicit in their contribution and reward patterns rather than in explicit comments. They do not express anger or blame in response to free riding, even when non-cooperators earn visibly higher payoffs. Instead of punishing through defection, they largely maintain their own cooperation, and they channel their response through selectively rewarding those who continue to contribute.\n\nThey seem sensitive to normative talk from others: when another player frames “everyone contribute the max” as a shared rule and later admonishes a peer in chat, the focal player does not join the chastising. Their behavior shows alignment with the cooperative norm, but their style remains non-accusatory. They do not overtly react to how much reward others spend or receive, even when some players invest very heavily in rewards. There is no evidence of envy or frustration about payoff differences; their strategy remains focused on supporting contributors and preserving mutual cooperation, rather than reacting strongly to every distributional detail."

Their contributions are usually at or slightly above the group average, but not maximally altruistic in a stable way. At multiple points they contribute their full endowment, indicating a willingness to prioritize group welfare, yet they also choose mid-range contributions that preserve a comfortable private payoff. Contribution levels fluctuate in response to others’ visible behavior: when partners contribute more, the player sometimes increases to full contribution; when others contribute little or free-ride, the player reduces back toward a moderate level rather than persisting at a high sacrifice. They appear to value fairness and mutual effort but not at any cost; they do not push a strict “always equal or above others” rule, nor do they clearly condition contributions on any one individual’s behavior. They tolerate some free-riding and asymmetry without sharp withdrawal. Risk tolerance seems moderate: they repeatedly risk being the highest contributor in the group, but they do not lock into that stance when it is not reciprocated.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nunknown (no chat content is provided, so tone, persuasion attempts, and direct coordination behavior are not observable).\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey never use the punishment option, even when others contribute substantially less or free-ride completely, and even though punishment is highly effective (large deductions for small cost). This indicates a strong reluctance to engage in costly negative sanctions. There is no evidence of reactive or retaliatory impulses toward low contributors or toward anyone who affects their relative payoff. They appear to prioritize keeping their own payoff and avoiding conflict over enforcing norms through harm. Whether this is driven by efficiency concerns (avoiding wasteful punishment) or by dislike of antagonism is unknown, but behaviorally they function as a non-punisher who tolerates deviations without imposing deterrence.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nThey are never punished by others, so their reaction to being targeted is unknown. There is no observable retaliation, compliance shift, or appeasement because they receive no negative sanctions.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey never reward anyone, including occasions where others contribute more than them or where a partner repeatedly benefits them via prosocial choices. Given that rewarding is payoff-neutral in this design (cost equals benefit), their refusal to use it suggests they do not adopt an active reinforcement strategy. They rely instead on passive adjustment of their own contributions, rather than using rewards to shape others’ behavior or signal gratitude. There is no sign that they attempt to form alliances via rewards or to encourage high cooperators with positive incentives.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThey receive small rewards multiple times from another player but do not reciprocate with rewards or visibly change their contribution pattern in a way tailored to that rewarder. Their cooperation level remains generally pro-social but not specifically responsive. This indicates low propensity for direct reciprocity via the reward mechanism and little interest in building dyadic exchange relationships. They also do not escalate their contributions beyond what they already do as a general cooperative baseline. Overall, they accept rewards passively without using them as a cue for special treatment.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey observe clear differences in others’ contributions, payoffs, and the presence of punishment events between other players, yet they maintain a calm, non-interventionist stance. They neither protect punished players nor join in sanctioning them, and they do not adjust contributions sharply in response to others’ gains or losses. When others benefit more than them, they do not exhibit envy-driven reduction in cooperation. When others are punished, they do not move to exploit the weakened player or compensate them. Their adjustments in contribution levels seem broadly responsive to the overall cooperation climate rather than to specific payoff shocks or sanction patterns. This suggests a player who monitors the environment but avoids direct involvement in sanction dynamics, and who maintains a baseline cooperative identity irrespective of local payoff inequalities or conflict among others."

They are clearly comfortable both fully cooperating and fully defecting rather than using intermediate or “hedging” levels when the option set is binary. Their cooperation is not purely altruistic: they sometimes exploit a cooperative group by withholding their own contribution while others continue to give. At the same time, they repeatedly return to full contribution, indicating that they value group efficiency and do not settle into persistent defection even after being punished. Their pattern suggests a mix of norm compliance and opportunism: they appear to treat full contribution as the default “right” behavior but occasionally test or exploit the environment by defecting when they may feel safe or uncertain about others. Risk tolerance appears moderate: they are willing to risk punishment and social sanctions by defecting, but they also invest in costly punishment to uphold norms, which is itself risky in payoff terms. There is no clear evidence of systematic fairness balancing over time beyond a basic expectation that everyone should contribute the maximum.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nunknown (no chat or explicit communication is present in the transcript). Their “communication” is entirely through contribution and sanction decisions, which function as implicit signals. Through these, they signal strong disapproval of non‑contributors and acceptance of full contributors but do not explicitly reward good behavior.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThey remain fully cooperative at the end of the game and do not show a decay in contribution in the final period. There is no sign of an end‑game defection spike; instead, they align with the group’s high-contribution norm right through the last round. They also stop using punishment when the group is fully cooperative, showing that they track current conditions and do not use sanctions gratuitously at the horizon. Their horizon awareness is evident in that they have full information about remaining rounds, yet they still maintain cooperation at the end, consistent with either a preference for sustaining norms regardless of horizon or a belief that maintaining a cooperative reputation matters even when there is no future interaction in this specific game (true underlying motive remains uncertain).\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey are an active, selective norm enforcer who uses costly punishment against clear free‑riders but does not employ antisocial punishment. They only target players who contribute nothing when most others are contributing fully, suggesting a focus on enforcing a simple norm: everyone should contribute fully. They do not punish cooperators, and they do not respond with retaliation against apparent punishers; their sanctions always match visible contribution deviations rather than their own payoff changes. They are willing to punish even when it is individually costly and when the offender later cooperates again, indicating a deterrence or retributive motive more than strategic payoff maximization. They also expand punishment to new defectors as they appear, suggesting attention to the entire group’s behavior rather than fixating on a single offender. They cease punishing once full cooperation is restored, consistent with instrumental norm enforcement rather than spite. Overall, they behave like a prosocial, third-party enforcer of contribution norms who tolerates some personal cost to sustain cooperation but also occasionally defects themselves, implying some inconsistency between their own behavior and the standard they enforce.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey never use the reward mechanism, despite frequent opportunities and repeated high contributions from almost all others. This indicates a strong asymmetry between negative and positive sanctions: they rely on punishment, not reward, to shape behavior. Possible interpretations include a belief that contribution is merely expected and not something to be positively reinforced, or an efficiency-minded preference to spend resources only on high-impact punishments rather than low-leverage rewards. It is also possible they regard the reward tool as unnecessary when a high-contribution norm is already in place. Their lack of reward use persists even when players who previously defected move to full cooperation, suggesting little inclination toward gratitude signaling or rehabilitative reinforcement; once behavior meets the norm, they simply withhold both punishment and reward."

They usually choose the fully cooperative option when group cooperation appears strong and stable. Their default is to match or support a high-cooperation environment rather than free ride on it. However, they are not a pure unconditional cooperator: when there is visible defection by others and the cooperative norm looks less secure, they are willing to withhold contribution at least once. This shift indicates conditional cooperation with some tolerance for exploiting a perceived breakdown in norms.\n\nThey do not experiment with mixed or intermediate strategies (where available) and instead treat contribution as a binary norm decision: either fully join the cooperative majority or fully opt out. Their behavior suggests moderate risk tolerance in early and mid game, as they continue to contribute fully despite observing at least one clear defector and no guaranteed individual-level enforcement. At the same time, they are sensitive to fairness: once multiple group members defect and the cooperative standard feels less universal, they temporarily switch to free riding.\n\nOverall, their contribution pattern fits a “norm-first, but not self-sacrificial” type: they want the efficient cooperative outcome when others are on board, yet they are prepared to deviate if they perceive that others are undermining that norm.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nunknown. There is no observable chat content or turn-taking in communication in the transcript, so their tone, persuasion style, and responsiveness to others’ messages cannot be inferred.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThis player shows clear awareness of the game horizon and treats the final stage differently from the immediate prior period. After testing or exploiting a lapse in cooperation shortly before the end, they revert to full cooperation at the final opportunity when everyone else is also cooperating. This pattern is inconsistent with a pure backward-induction “defect at the end” logic and is more consistent with either norm-maintenance or payoff-salience at the final stage.\n\nThey appear responsive to the current social environment in the end game: seeing universal or near-universal cooperation, they align with it instead of taking a last-moment free-ride. This suggests that, near the end, their behavior is shaped more by a desire to conform to an established cooperative standard and secure the efficient outcome than by a short-term temptation to defect. Their cooperation does not decay as the end approaches; if anything, it recovers after a brief deviation, indicating either learning from negative feedback or a deliberate choice to leave on a cooperative footing.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey never use the punishment mechanism, despite at least some opportunities where punishing low contributors might be a straightforward norm-enforcing response. This strongly indicates a reluctance to spend their own resources to sanction others, even when punishment is highly cost-effective in terms of imposed loss versus personal cost.\n\nTheir non-use of punishment occurs even when they themselves are targeted by punishment from others. They do not retaliate or engage in second-order punishment, suggesting they are either indifferent to such sanctions, strategically focused on preserving their own payoff, or unwilling to escalate conflict. Their behavior fits a “non-punishing conditional cooperator”: they adjust their own contributions in response to others’ behavior instead of using the formal sanctioning tools to deter or correct defection.\n\nTheir motives for avoiding punishment could be efficiency-oriented (avoid wasteful costs), conflict-averse, or simply indifferent to enforcement; the transcript does not allow distinguishing these, so this is unknown.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey never use the reward mechanism, even in periods of strong cooperation where rewarding could reinforce prosocial behavior. Given that rewarding is cost-neutral in expectation (one coin spent to give one coin), their abstention suggests they are unwilling to spend any resources, even break-even, to shape others’ incentives or to express gratitude.\n\nThis pattern implies a strictly self-payoff-focused approach to the sanctioning stage: they rely on their own contributions as their cooperative signal and do not engage in explicit positive reinforcement of others. They appear to treat high contributions by others as expected behavior rather than something to be actively rewarded.\n\nOverall, they resemble a “quiet conditional cooperator” who supports cooperation mainly through their own contribution choices and adapts those choices based on the group’s behavior, while systematically abstaining from both punishment and reward tools."

They begin with a moderate contribution that sits between full free-riding and full cooperation and then move to full cooperation. This pattern suggests they are generally willing to support the public good and do not anchor on pure self-interest. The increase in contribution is consistent with positive conditional cooperation: they appear to respond to the relatively high cooperative environment by raising their own contribution, rather than exploiting it. They are not rigidly fixed to one level; instead, they adjust upward when others’ behavior indicates strong group-oriented norms. They show willingness to sacrifice private payoff for group benefit and appear comfortable bearing some risk that others might not match their cooperation. Their behavior suggests a concern for being at least in line with, and at times above, the perceived norm of contribution, but there is insufficient evidence to conclude specific fairness rules (e.g., exact matching to others); they simply lean clearly toward the cooperative side. Volatility is low across the short game: they do not oscillate or pull back from cooperation, but move in a single, cooperative direction, indicating a stable prosocial orientation rather than opportunistic exploitation.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nunknown. There is no observable chat or messaging behavior in the transcript, so their tone, engagement style, and responsiveness in communication cannot be inferred.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey do not use the reward mechanism at all, despite operating in an environment where many others are contributing high amounts. This indicates a reluctance or disinterest in engaging in second-order cooperation via costly rewards. Possible interpretations (all low confidence): they may prioritize conserving their own payoff once they have contributed, they may see their contribution choice as sufficient expression of cooperation, or they may judge the cost and benefit of the reward mechanism as not worth engaging with strategically. There is no evidence that they attempt to reinforce or shape others’ behavior through rewards, nor that they use rewards as social signals of approval or alliance-building. Their cooperative stance is expressed only through contribution decisions, not through additional costly prosocial acts.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThey receive no rewards, so their response style to being rewarded is unknown. There is no evidence on whether they would reciprocate, form alliances, or adjust contributions based on identifiable rewarders."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a predominantly free-riding, payoff-maximizing type who occasionally experiments with cooperation but quickly reverts to exploiting others’ contributions.\n\nThey consistently choose the individually dominant action whenever it clearly increases personal payoff, showing a strong preference for keeping their endowment rather than contributing to the group. Their one instance of contributing is isolated and not maintained; it appears more like a strategic test of what happens when they cooperate than a stable norm or commitment to fairness.\n\nTheir contribution pattern is conditional and reactive: after observing that contributing yields a lower payoff than free-riding while others continue to contribute at high rates, they return to non-contribution and stick with it. This suggests a simple, outcome-oriented heuristic: prefer the action that generates higher own payoff given others’ apparent willingness to contribute.\n\nThey do not exhibit a fairness norm focused on equalizing payoffs; they repeatedly accept earning more than most others via free-riding. There is no sign that they are trying to match others’ behavior or “do their part” for the group when that conflicts with their own monetary interest.\n\nRisk tolerance appears moderate: they are willing to try the less individually safe option (cooperating) once, but once the outcome confirms that this reduces their payoff relative to free-riding, they abandon it. This pattern indicates some openness to exploration but a quick return to self-interested exploitation when the environment proves favorable to free-riders.\n\nOverall, the type is best characterized as an outcome-driven opportunistic free-rider: they are attentive to payoff structure, test cooperation briefly, then reliably defect when defection is clearly more profitable.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThe player consistently responds to others’ high contributions and relatively lower payoffs by positioning themselves to benefit from those contributions rather than aligning with them.\n\nWhen others earn less than the player while contributing more, the player does not move toward more cooperative behavior; instead, they maintain or revert to free-riding. This indicates that others’ worse outcomes do not trigger compensatory behavior, guilt, or attempts to restore equity. Rather than being deterred by the evident exploitation of cooperators, the player appears to treat these outcomes as confirmation that free-riding is the best response to the group’s behavior.\n\nThey also seem to treat others’ continuing contributions as a stable resource: as long as enough others keep contributing, the player is content to free-ride. There is no evidence that seeing some peers also free-ride leads them to increase their own contributions to protect the public good. Instead, observing that free-riders can do well or better appears to reinforce their own low-contribution strategy.\n\nBecause there is no punishment or reward available, we cannot observe any direct costly reaction to others’ payoffs. However, the indirect behavioral adjustments strongly suggest that this player is not motivated by others’ welfare or by disapproval of inequality; they update their behavior solely in response to how others’ actions affect the profitability of free-riding versus contributing, and they choose the option that maximizes their own payoff even when it clearly leaves others worse off."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThe player is a self-aware, opportunistic free-rider who occasionally cooperates to maintain group goodwill. They understand that contributing maximally is socially expected and can yield group gains, but they prioritize their own payoff whenever they see room to exploit strong cooperation from others.\n\nTheir contribution pattern is mixed but not random: they alternate between full contribution and full defection, never choosing intermediate amounts (only the two available extremes). They contribute fully in some stretches when group norms of cooperation are salient and when they are under social attention, then revert to consistent non-contribution once the environment feels safe for them to free-ride. They are capable of sustained cooperation for several consecutive decisions, but this collapses when they anticipate that others will continue contributing regardless of their own behavior.\n\nThey show clear conditionality: they urge others to “not be tight” and give the maximum when cooperation levels have dipped, framing contribution as the right thing to do. Yet they themselves defect in multiple instances immediately after or around such messaging, especially when others are mostly cooperative and when they can personally profit from the public good funded by others. This reflects a “public moralist, private opportunist” style: they endorse high contributions as a norm but do not reliably adhere to it when there is no direct sanction.\n\nThe player’s sense of fairness is asymmetric. They want others to be generous, describe under-contributors (implicitly) as “tight,” and express no guilt or apology when called out for giving nothing. They do not defend or justify their low contributions when named by others, suggesting they are either comfortable with the resulting mild disapproval or find that the social cost is low enough to ignore.\n\nRisk tolerance appears moderate. They are willing to be one of a small subset defecting in an otherwise cooperative group, which risks social criticism but promises higher payoffs. At the same time, they periodically return to full contribution, which can be read either as a response to social pressure, a desire to avoid standing out as purely selfish, or mild concern that persistent defection might harm future group cooperation and hence their own long-run payoffs. Across the later stages, once strong cooperative norms and high total contributions are established, they increasingly choose non-contribution, indicating that when they believe others’ cooperation is stable, they see little downside in free-riding.\n\nOverall, their strategy is flexible exploitation: cooperate enough to be included and occasionally praised, but defect whenever the group environment appears cooperative and forgiving.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThe player’s communication is playful, teasing, and attention-seeking, with a light, humorous tone. They engage actively in the chat, responding to the social atmosphere rather than driving detailed strategic coordination. They adopt a persona-focused style (“monkey” identity, bodily needs jokes, mock-flirtation), which makes them socially salient without committing them strongly to any cooperative contract.\n\nThey do attempt basic coordination: they explicitly urge others to contribute the maximum and frame withholding as being “tight,” appealing to social norms rather than precise payoff calculations. They also at one point jokingly suggest that others “should all contribute to” them, making the selfish intent explicit in a humorous way. This indicates that they understand the structure of the game and how others’ contributions benefit them, and they are comfortable rhetorically nudging others toward behavior that advantages them.\n\nTheir persuasion tactics are informal, relying on banter and status-play rather than argument or data. They do not supply payoff math or long-run reasoning; instead, they invoke identity and affect (e.g., shame around tightness, playful self-labeling as a “king” of complainers) to influence group norms. They appear unconcerned about being labeled “greedy” or “mean,” and they respond to such labels with humor or silence rather than contrition, showing low sensitivity to mild social sanction.\n\nResponsiveness is selective. Early on, they explicitly respond to the ongoing social conversation, including location talk and flirtatious comments. When their defection is noted by others, they occasionally acknowledge the group (for example, with an emotive reaction when targeted by attack/joke), but they do not offer substantive justification or change in response to a single complaint. Later, when others speculate that they are absent, they remain silent for a time, which may be actual distraction or strategic non-engagement; once they resume speaking, they are friendly and emotionally expressive, quickly reintegrating into the social flow.\n\nTheir overall engagement style is socially playful, irreverent, and non-confrontational. They prefer to maintain a lighthearted, likable persona while quietly implementing an individually advantageous contribution strategy. They are willing to encourage group cooperation in words, but their actual behavior reveals that they see the chat primarily as a social space and a tool for maintaining acceptance, not as a binding commitment to fair contribution."

Their baseline tendency is to free-ride when cooperation from others appears secure, then partially align with the group only when non-cooperation becomes conspicuous or psychologically costly.\n\nThey initially choose the individually payoff-maximizing option with no contribution, despite very strong cooperative behavior from most others. This indicates a clear understanding of the material incentives and a willingness to exploit a cooperative group for personal gain. They show low aversion to benefiting from others’ generosity and no early sign of internalized fairness norms.\n\nTheir pattern later shifts toward contribution, but not in a way that suggests stable prosocial preference. The contribution change occurs only after they have already enjoyed repeated high payoffs from others’ cooperation while not contributing themselves. This is more consistent with conditional or reputational concerns (e.g., not wanting to stand out as a persistent defector) than with intrinsic fairness or efficiency motives.\n\nTheir behavior is moderately conditional on others’ actions: they do not lead in setting a cooperative norm, but they do not remain a pure, stubborn free-rider once nearly everyone else is cooperating. Instead, they ultimately match the emerging group standard of contributing when defection becomes relatively rare. Risk tolerance appears moderate: they are comfortable taking the social and strategic “risk” of free-riding in an otherwise cooperative environment, suggesting they expect continued cooperation despite their own defection. Overall contribution volatility is low in absolute frequency (they use only the two extreme options), but the late shift signals that their strategy is adaptive rather than fixed.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nunknown.

Their engagement style in communication, tone, and willingness to negotiate norms cannot be inferred and must be treated as unknown.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThe player shows no clear end-game decay in cooperation; instead, their final-round behavior becomes more cooperative than their earlier choices. This suggests that they either do not rely on backward induction to justify defection in the last period or do not treat the final round as an automatic excuse to free-ride.\n\nTheir increased cooperation near the game’s horizon is more compatible with a reputational or norm-conforming impulse that activates once a cooperative pattern is firmly established. Even without future rounds, they are willing to incur a personal cost to align more closely with the group’s cooperative behavior. However, because there is no direct evidence about their beliefs or explicit horizon reasoning, the depth of their end-game awareness is unknown, and any interpretation of their motives (guilt, reciprocity, desire not to end as the “bad actor”) remains low-confidence."

They repeatedly choose the selfishly optimal action even when it is also socially exploitative, showing that they prioritize individual payoff over collective welfare when there is no interpersonal pressure or sanctioning mechanism in play.\n\nTheir pattern is not random: they are consistent in initially contributing nothing while others contribute a lot, indicating a stable preference for exploiting cooperative environments when such environments appear robust. The eventual shift to full contribution suggests that their behavior is conditional, but the condition is not clearly payoff-maximizing from a narrow self-interest perspective; instead, it appears driven by a mix of norm recognition and perhaps delayed reciprocity or guilt, though the exact motivation remains unknown.\n\nThey show willingness to incur a personal cost to cooperate after benefiting from others’ generosity for some time, implying they are not a pure, unwavering free-rider. However, the timing of their switch indicates that they are slow to reciprocate and comfortable accepting advantage from others before adjusting their own behavior. Attitude toward fairness is ambiguous: they ultimately align with the dominant cooperative norm, but only after having already gained more than their “fair share” earlier; this could reflect a minimalist fairness norm (“cooperate eventually” rather than “cooperate consistently”).\n\nRisk tolerance appears moderate. They do not experiment with intermediate or alternating strategies; instead they choose an extreme option (no contribution) while the group is clearly cooperative, which is low-risk in this environment because there is no punishment. The later move to full contribution suggests sensitivity to the possibility of future gains from sustaining high cooperation, but because there is no direct evidence of their beliefs, their internal calculus remains low-confidence and partially unknown.\n\nOverall, this is a player who opportunistically free-rides when others’ cooperation is strong and unpunished, but who eventually aligns with the group’s cooperative pattern, possibly reflecting a desire not to be entirely out of step with the emerging norm.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nunknown. There is no observable chat or messaging behavior, so tone, persuasion attempts, responsiveness in conversation, and engagement/avoidance style in communication cannot be inferred. Any social or personality inferences must therefore rely solely on contribution choices and are low-confidence with respect to underlying motives such as empathy, shame, or desire for approval.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThe player does not display classic end-game unraveling; instead of reducing cooperation toward the horizon, they increase it. As the game approaches its final stage, they shift from continued free-riding to a fully cooperative choice, which is atypical for strictly payoff-maximizing behavior in a finite-horizon PGG without punishment or reward options.\n\nThis end-of-game increase suggests that they may be influenced by non-monetary considerations such as aligning with perceived social norms, wanting to “leave on a cooperative note,” or a delayed sense of obligation after having exploited the group. However, because there is no direct statement of intent, these motives are speculative and should be treated as uncertain.\n\nThey clearly recognize the finite horizon, but rather than exploiting the last round more aggressively, they behave more pro-socially at the end than earlier. In new environments, this pattern implies that when they see a stable, cooperative group and understand that interaction is about to conclude, they may sometimes choose to contribute in the final phase despite having previously free-ridden, especially if they perceive that others have maintained cooperation throughout."

They understand that high group contributions maximize earnings, but they treat that mainly as a tool to induce others to give, not as a binding norm for themselves.\n\nThey start by contributing fully and explicitly frame full contribution as payoff-maximizing, indicating they grasp the game’s efficiency structure and see cooperation as instrumentally rational. After establishing this, they quickly switch to taking everything for themselves in multiple rounds, even when the rest of the group is highly cooperative and explicitly coordinating on full contributions. They later revert once to full contribution, then return to taking everything again, showing a volatile pattern driven by opportunism rather than stable norms.\n\nTheir behavior is strongly conditional on the strategic landscape, not on fairness: they are willing to free-ride on near-universal cooperation despite having previously encouraged or endorsed high contributions. They are not deterred by social disapproval in chat or by being singled out as non-cooperative; they continue to defect when it is lucrative. This suggests low sensitivity to fairness norms and low concern for inequity aversion, while displaying high tolerance for social risk and reputational criticism.\n\nOverall, this player’s contribution strategy is best described as: understand cooperation, promote it verbally, but frequently defect to exploit cooperative groups when possible, with no clear pattern of reciprocity to others’ past contributions.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThe player communicates infrequently but strategically. When they do speak, they present themselves as rational and payoff-focused, explicitly invoking the logic that cooperative behavior increases group and individual earnings. This casts them as someone who wants to appear as a reasoned, efficiency-minded participant rather than openly selfish.\n\nThey do not respond directly to accusations, pleas, or shaming from others, even when multiple participants call them out by name. Instead, they largely stay silent during criticism, indicating an avoidance style under social pressure and low motivation to repair reputation or justify their actions.\n\nTheir only other comment later in the game is a terse response to a teammate’s question about game length, where they supply an uninformed guess. This shows willingness to engage casually but not to lead or coordinate once they are known as a defector. They do not attempt to persuade others later to change behavior, nor do they apologize or explain their defection.\n\nIn social tone, they are neutral and somewhat detached: not aggressive, not conciliatory, and not emotionally expressive. Their communication is minimal, functional, and primarily used to frame cooperation as rational at the outset, rather than to maintain relationships or norms across the game.\n\n<REWARD>\nThe player never uses the reward mechanism at any point, despite consistently benefiting from others’ high contributions. This indicates a strong reluctance to incur any personal cost to encourage or recognize cooperative behavior, even when doing so might support a profitable cooperative norm.\n\nTheir non-use of rewards persists across situations where many others contribute heavily and where they personally gain the most from others’ generosity while giving little or nothing themselves. There is no evidence of them attempting to strategically reinforce contributors, signal gratitude, or shape others’ behavior via rewards. They also never discuss the reward mechanism in chat, suggesting either low interest in it or a deliberate choice to free-ride without investing in norm enforcement.\n\nOverall, they treat the reward option as dominated by keeping their own coins: they prioritize short-term private payoff over any costly signaling or long-term group-benefit strategy. Whether they conceptually understand the potential strategic value of rewards beyond the immediate cost-benefit is unknown, but their behavior is consistent with a purely self-regarding payoff maximizer who declines all costly pro-social actions."

Their contribution level remains unchanged across opportunities, suggesting a deliberate baseline rather than noise or confusion. They appear to understand that the environment is highly cooperative and generous but do not adjust upward in response; their behavior is weakly conditional at best and not driven by reciprocity. They do not signal any fairness norm about matching others’ efforts, and they tolerate being far below the group’s cooperative level. Risk tolerance in contribution is low: they avoid staking much of their endowment despite clear evidence that others are contributing heavily and that the marginal return to group contributions is high. They focus on maximizing personal payoff while preserving social cover through small, non-zero contributions.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThe player engages selectively and socially rather than instrumentally. They do not attempt to lead coordination on contribution levels or explicitly discuss strategy. Instead, they comment on other players’ behavior only when a clear free-rider emerges, highlighting that individual while not volunteering to change their own low-contribution pattern. Their tone is casual and humorous, with a clear political reference used to frame the non-contributor’s behavior negatively. They align themselves with others who criticize the free-rider, positioning as part of the cooperative “ingroup” despite personally under-contributing. They respond to ongoing chat and show awareness of national/political identity, indicating comfort with light banter and ideological positioning, but they avoid any self-disclosure about their own contribution choices or motives. Overall, they are socially engaged, mildly confrontational toward obvious defectors, and use irony and politics to bond and signal values.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThere is no observable strategic shift when the horizon is short and known.

They do not exploit the last round more aggressively, but also do not respond to others’ explicit calls for maximal cooperation in the final opportunity. Awareness that the game is ending does not visibly alter their risk posture or cooperative stance; their pattern suggests a pre-set contribution rule that they carry through to the end without dynamic adjustment.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThe player observes that most others are contributing much more and that payoffs for extreme free-riding and for moderate contribution are both high, but they show no explicit verbal reaction to payoff differences. Their only direct response to others’ outcomes is social: they focus on the player who contributes nothing, calling that behavior out and implicitly condemning it as politically aligned with a disliked ideology. They do not express sympathy, envy, or praise regarding others’ earnings, nor do they discuss efficiency or collective gains. Instead, they use social and political labeling to police the most blatant free-rider while leaving their own milder free-riding unexamined. This suggests they are attentive to others’ behaviors and relative contribution levels, but channel their response into norm-enforcing talk rather than into changing their own cooperative level."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a **strategic, flexible conditional cooperator with intermittent free-riding**. They clearly understand that contributing can be beneficial and are willing to contribute high amounts, including full endowments, multiple times. However, they also deliberately exploit cooperative environments by occasionally contributing nothing while others give substantial amounts. Their pattern is not stable: contributions range from zero to full, with several medium contributions as well. This volatility suggests they are actively experimenting with the tradeoff between personal payoff and group cooperation, rather than following a fixed rule.\n\nThey condition their behavior on the recent contribution climate. When others are largely cooperative, they sometimes reciprocate with high contributions but also sometimes seize the opportunity to free-ride, indicating a relatively high tolerance for inequity when it is in their favor. They do not clearly try to match the group average; instead, they oscillate between generous and exploitative moves, possibly probing what the group will tolerate and how payoffs respond. There is no strong evidence of a strict fairness norm; they appear comfortable ending many rounds with higher payoffs than high contributors without visibly correcting for that in subsequent behavior.\n\nRisk-wise, they are willing to invest heavily in the public good even after past rounds where such contributions yielded lower personal payoffs relative to defectors. This suggests moderate social or efficiency motives coexisting with self-interest. At the same time, they repeatedly revert to zero contributions in cooperative environments, which indicates they also prioritize payoff maximization when it seems “safe” to do so. Overall, they embody a mixed-strategy type who both supports and exploits cooperation, adjusting opportunistically rather than adhering to a principled cooperative norm.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThe player does not send any chat messages in the transcript. Their communication style is therefore **silent and observational**. They do not initiate coordination, do not respond to others’ calls for full contribution, and do not engage with social banter or moral commentary about selfishness. This makes it impossible to infer their explicit beliefs, intentions, or justifications.\n\nGiven that chat is available but unused by them, they likely prefer to express their stance through contributions rather than words. They neither publicly commit to cooperation nor defend defection. This absence of verbal engagement may also be a deliberate strategy to avoid social pressure or reputational costs associated with visible free-riding. Responsiveness to others is purely behavioral and not discursive. Their tone, persuasion style, and social warmth are all **unknown**.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nToward the end of the game, this player **does not show a simple monotonic decay in contributions**. In the final phase, they make several full contributions, even in the very last round, despite the absence of future interactions and the lack of punishment or reward mechanisms. This pattern is inconsistent with a pure final-round defector who maximizes last-period earnings by contributing nothing.\n\nAt the same time, they continue to mix high and zero contributions in the late game, indicating that end-game awareness does not eliminate their opportunistic side. Instead, their late-game behavior remains mixed but is skewed toward higher contributions relative to some earlier lows. This suggests that they may value maintaining cooperation or group efficiency even when there are no future rounds, or they may be following a habit of “sometimes all-in” irrespective of horizon. It is **unknown** whether they are consciously thinking about the number of rounds remaining, but their strategy does not collapse into pure free-riding as the game ends.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThe player sees others’ contributions and payoffs each round, but offers **no explicit verbal reaction**. Behaviorally, they tolerate large payoff advantages for themselves over consistent cooperators without clear compensatory actions. After profiting significantly from others’ generosity, they sometimes increase their own contributions later, but not in a way that clearly “repays” past advantages; the cycles of generosity and exploitation continue rather than converge toward an equity-driven pattern.\n\nThey also remain willing to contribute high amounts even when prior high contributors have been worse off than defectors, which implies they are not overly discouraged by observing others’ relative losses from cooperation. However, when the environment is highly cooperative, they do not consistently match the group’s high contributions, signaling that others’ sacrifices do not strongly compel them to equalize. Their emotional response to outcomes (guilt, pride, resentment, etc.) is **unknown**; all that can be inferred is that they adapt their contributions in a way that blends conditional cooperation with opportunistic free-riding, without overt concern for correcting payoff imbalances."

This indicates that their verbal commitments are cheap talk and not binding for their own strategy.\n\nThey show a mild interest in the group’s social narrative, making brief comments that acknowledge ongoing themes (e.g., the “wolf” motif, clarifying their identity as “a dog”). Their tone is casual and humorous rather than confrontational or moralizing. When their actions diverge from cooperative expectations, they use light, low-stakes remarks (such as an “oops”-style comment) rather than justification, apology, or argument.\n\nThey do not actively persuade others to change their contribution levels, nor do they criticize or shame low or high contributors. They ask a simple question about an in‑group label (“who is the wolf”) instead of directly addressing contribution behavior. Their responsiveness to chat is limited: they respond occasionally to what others say, but they do not sustain extended dialogue or coordination efforts.\n\nOverall, the communication style is low-effort, socially aware but non-directive, and avoids conflict. They appear comfortable being labeled as the “wolf” (i.e., the selfish player) and do not attempt to defend or explain their payoff‑maximizing behavior.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThe player shows clear horizon awareness and exploits the final stage of the game. Near the very end, when future reciprocity is no longer a concern, they revert to pure free-riding even while others contribute very generously. This indicates an understanding of the end-game incentive to defect and a willingness to act on it.\n\nThey do not use the last rounds to “repair” their reputation or reciprocate; instead, they maximize final-round personal payoff, accepting a large advantage over others. There is no observable effort to sustain cooperation once the game is about to end. If they have any fairness or reciprocity motives, these are clearly dominated by payoff maximization at the horizon.\n\nEarlier in the late game (before the final round), they continue to mix partial and full contributions with occasional free-riding, suggesting that end-game effects are strongest at the very end rather than producing a smooth decline from the midpoint onward. They appear to maintain some cooperative behavior up until the final opportunity where defection is costless in terms of future interaction.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThe player has full visibility of others’ contributions and payoffs and appears behaviorally responsive to them, but does not verbalize any explicit judgment. They free-ride heavily on rounds where others contribute a lot and accept the resulting payoff advantage without comment, indicating low concern for outcome equality. They also, at times, respond to high group contributions by contributing substantial amounts themselves in later rounds, suggesting some sensitivity to the cooperative climate and perhaps a desire to keep the group from collapsing into full defection.\n\nThey do not express sympathy for those who earn less, nor irritation toward those who contribute little. When another participant labels the situation as “selfish,” the player does not defend themselves or challenge the characterization. Their only explicit reaction to a stark payoff asymmetry is a light acknowledgment when they free-ride after a call for high contributions, which reads as mildly self-aware but not remorseful.\n\nBecause punishment and reward mechanisms are absent, there is no direct evidence of how they would spend resources to influence others’ outcomes. Based on their acceptance of repeated free-riding gains and lack of protest when others also free-ride, they seem tolerant of inequality as long as their own payoffs remain high. Their behavioral adjustments suggest that they track others’ outcomes instrumentally—using observed cooperation levels to time their own exploitation or occasional cooperation—rather than out of strong fairness or moral concern."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a calculated, opportunistic conditional cooperator who mixes moderate giving with frequent free-riding. They treat contribution as a flexible tool rather than a moral rule. Across the game, they alternate between contributing nothing, small amounts, and mid-level contributions, with no long stable pattern; this indicates strategic volatility rather than a fixed “always cooperate” or “always defect” stance.\n\nThey appear highly payoff-focused: they repeatedly exploit situations where others are contributing heavily by giving nothing while still benefiting from the public fund. At the same time, they occasionally contribute moderate amounts even when free-riding would be profitable, suggesting they value maintaining group contribution levels to keep the public fund from collapsing completely.\n\nThey seem sensitive to the general cooperation climate. When group contributions are high or being pushed upward, they often join with a non-maximal, compromise contribution rather than fully matching high cooperators. When contributions are slipping or mixed, they tend more toward zero or low contributions. This pattern suggests they believe others will usually keep contributing enough to sustain a decent fund and that they can ride that while occasionally “topping up” to avoid being a pure exploiter.\n\nThey do not appear strongly fairness-driven in a strict sense; they repeatedly accept payoff advantages over high contributors without visible discomfort. However, they are not purely exploitative either; they show willingness to contribute meaningful amounts periodically, especially when cooperation is salient in the chat or appears to be re-coordinating.\n\nRisk tolerance regarding cooperation is moderate: they are willing to contribute even when there is some risk that others may not, but they often hedge by contributing only partially instead of going all-in. They do not commit to extreme cooperative strategies; instead, they maintain flexibility and reserve the option to revert to free-riding when it seems advantageous or safe.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThe player’s communication is sparse but socially engaged. They never initiate strategic planning about contributions themselves, but they participate lightly in the ongoing social narrative. Their tone is casual and somewhat playful. They respond to others’ prompts or jokes more than they start their own coordination efforts.\n\nThey acknowledge group dynamics with short affirmations and comments, occasionally aligning verbally with others’ remarks. They use brief, low-effort messages rather than long arguments, suggesting low investment in persuasion. There is no clear attempt to instruct others how much to contribute; instead, they comment around the social framing (e.g., playing along with the “wolf” narrative) rather than directly about optimal group strategy.\n\nThey show responsiveness to direct questions or cues from others, but they do not lead. Their engagement style is reactive rather than proactive: they answer, agree, or lightly tease, but they do not push a new cooperative norm or try to rally the group. There is no evidence of anger or moral condemnation; their social demeanor appears even-tempered and somewhat humorous.\n\nOverall, they are socially present enough to blend into the group but strategically opaque: they do not use chat to signal their own contribution intentions reliably, nor to justify their free-riding or contributions.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThis player is clearly horizon-aware: as the game approaches its final rounds, they adjust behavior in ways that reflect recognition of the impending end but do not simply collapse into full defection. In the late phase, they sharply vary between zero and moderate contributions, including returning to nontrivial giving in the final rounds.\n\nThey do not exhibit a smooth monotonic decline in contributions. Instead, they use the endgame to alternate between exploiting high cooperators and occasionally supporting the group when contributions are coordinated upward again. In the final rounds, when group cooperation spikes, they join at an intermediate level rather than going to maximum or minimum, indicating they still care about extracting value from the common pool rather than purely maximizing their last-round private payoff at all costs.\n\nThere is no explicit verbal reference to the game ending, but behavior shows that they are no longer experimenting or searching for a norm; they are exploiting known patterns (others’ tendency to contribute) while still contributing enough not to be an outlier. This suggests a pragmatic end-game mindset: prioritize earnings, but keep the group’s cooperation engine running if it is still beneficial.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThe player pays attention to others’ contributions and resulting payoffs, as evidenced by the way their own contributions track the overall cooperation climate. When others contribute heavily and bear more of the cost, they are willing to enjoy the payoff advantage and do not visibly express guilt or gratitude. They tolerate payoff asymmetries that favor them without remark.\n\nTheir chat responses occasionally reflect awareness of behavior patterns (such as identifying who is acting “wolf-like”), but they do not directly criticize or praise specific payoff outcomes. They do not publicly confront high contributors or low contributors, nor do they explicitly complain about being exploited; this suggests a relatively nonjudgmental stance toward inequality in outcomes.\n\nInstead of moralizing, they adapt quietly: if others keep the fund high, they lean toward freeriding; if others start cutting back or re-coordinating, they increase their own contribution somewhat. This indicates that others’ outcomes function for them primarily as strategic information rather than emotional triggers.\n\nBecause punishment and reward are unavailable, there is no direct evidence of how they would use such tools. However, their tolerance for enjoying advantages without commentary hints that, if such mechanisms were present, they might be reluctant to spend resources punishing or rewarding others and would instead rely on silent strategic adjustment. Overall, they appear outcome-aware and opportunistic, but socially low-conflict and emotionally muted in response to others’ gains or losses."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a predominantly free-riding, payoff-maximizing type with occasional, strategic full contributions. Their default pattern is to keep their entire endowment and let others fund the public good. Full contributions occur only a few times and do not persist; they are isolated choices rather than the start of a cooperative streak.\n\nThey strongly exploit any cooperative environment that emerges. When others contribute highly, they reliably continue to free-ride rather than reciprocate. They still free-ride even when others’ cooperation is stable, indicating low intrinsic motivation for fairness or efficiency and a focus on personal gains over group outcomes.\n\nTheir cooperation appears weakly conditional at best: early in the game, they sometimes contribute when others are contributing substantially, but they quickly shift to a robust non-contribution strategy despite continued contributions from others. This suggests that early cooperation is either exploratory or based on a short-lived fairness or norm-testing impulse, which is then overridden by the clear monetary advantage of defecting.\n\nThey do not show gradual adjustment or partial giving; choices are binary and polarized between full contribution and full defection. Once they settle into free-riding, their behavior is highly stable with two late “exceptions” that look more like experiments or noise than true norm-following. Because they occasionally contribute even when free-riding is clearly more profitable given others’ behavior, some minor weight on norms, curiosity, or desire to probe others’ responses is possible, but overall their revealed preference is strongly payoff-driven.\n\nGiven the multiplier is lower than the marginal private return from keeping coins, their behavior is consistent with a player who understands that unilateral defection is individually optimal, and who is willing to accept persistent payoff inequalities in their favor. Fairness concerns, if present at all, are weak and easily dominated by self-interest. Risk tolerance appears moderate: they are willing to depend on others’ cooperation for surplus while taking no personal risk of loss, rather than trying to “lead” or stabilize group cooperation at personal cost.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThis player consistently responds to others’ outcomes in a self-serving, exploitative way. When others earn less because they contribute more, the player continues to free-ride and does not shift toward cooperation to reduce inequality. When others cooperate heavily and earn strictly less than the player, the player maintains or even reinforces their free-riding stance, accepting a role as a beneficiary of others’ sacrifices.\n\nThey do not appear to “reward” high contributors through their own behavior; cooperative actions by peers do not lead to matching contributions, even when cooperation is widespread and sustained. Similarly, they do not appear to “punish” defectors through increased contribution or any costly action; when others reduce their contributions and receive lower payoffs as a result, the player does not step in to support the public fund.\n\nChanges in others’ payoffs occasionally coincide with the player switching to contribution, but these switches are not followed by sustained cooperative behavior and often run counter to immediate self-interest. This makes it difficult to attribute these changes to systematic fairness, reciprocity, or guilt; they more plausibly reflect low-confidence experimentation or momentary deviation rather than a stable prosocial rule. There is no evidence of strong emotional or moral reactions to inequality; the player tolerates large payoff advantages over cooperators without adjusting their strategy.\n\nOverall, the player behaves as a rational free-rider who tracks that defection reliably yields higher or equal payoffs than contribution, and they act accordingly. Their observed responses suggest weak or absent inequality aversion, minimal concern for group efficiency once the cost to themselves is salient, and little inclination to use their own behavior as a signal to coordinate on higher collective outcomes."
