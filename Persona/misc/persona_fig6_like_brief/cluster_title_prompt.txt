Here are 23 clusters of behavioral codes in the provided list. A behavioral code is a piece
of natural language that describes motivations behind strategic behaviors. Please summarize these
behavioral code clusters in to short titles (e.g., within four words).

The summarized cluster titles should be: (1) understandable, (2) semantically relevant to the
behavioral codes inside the clusters, (3) well covering the whole cluster, (4) distinguishable from
other clusters, (5) generate a generalizable cluster title and avoid including any information
specific to this game scenario.

Before output, please go back and forth review and refine the summarized cluster titles
so that they meet the requirements. Please output the cluster names in lines, followed by the
summarized titles (e.g., "cluster 8AE92B-496: ...").
