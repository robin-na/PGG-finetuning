        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a stable, unconditional high contributor. They consistently allocate their full endowment to the public fund every round, regardless of how much others give, whether cooperation is high or low, and whether they are personally being rewarded. They behave as if full cooperation is the default and morally or strategically “right” choice, rather than something to be varied in response to others’ behavior.\n\nTheir contributions do not appear contingent on short-term payoff maximization: they continue to cooperate fully even when the group under-contributes and their own per-round payoff is relatively low. This suggests a strong internal norm in favor of contributing, with low sensitivity to exploitation risk. They tolerate free-riding by others without retaliating through reduced contributions.\n\nThey seem comfortable shouldering more than their “fair share” when others contribute less, yet they also remain engaged and mildly critical when some players do not match the cooperative norm. Overall, they embody a prosocial, high-trust type who treats contribution as a near-absolute rule, not a negotiable strategy.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nTheir communication is sparse but socially attuned. They respond politely to greetings and acknowledge successful coordination with a brief, positive signal. Their tone is friendly and light; they use a small expressive cue (a simple emotive symbol) once cooperation stabilizes, which reads as contentment or relief at the emerging norm.\n\nThey do not initiate detailed strategic proposals, but they do make at least one pointed, critical remark aimed at those not fully cooperating, implying awareness of and mild frustration with perceived hypocrisy or free-riding. This criticism is framed in a casual, somewhat joking style rather than overt aggression, suggesting they prefer soft social pressure over confrontational shaming.\n\nThey are reactive rather than leading in the chat: they respond after others talk about strategies and contributions, and they do not attempt to micro-coordinate specific contribution levels or reward patterns. Their engagement style is low-frequency but responsive, with a mix of politeness and light norm enforcement through comments rather than detailed argument.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey are willing but selective in using the reward mechanism. They rarely spend on rewards overall, and when they do, they spend modest amounts rather than systematically reinforcing all cooperators. Their use of rewards coincides with periods where others are contributing relatively more, suggesting that their reward behavior is conditional on observed cooperation level.\n\nThey do not use rewards to compensate themselves (since rewarding others is payoff-neutral by design, and they still choose to do it at times), implying that when they pay to reward, they are expressing approval or trying to support cooperative behavior rather than pursuing direct material gain. They show no clear pattern of rewarding in proportion to others’ exact contributions, and they do not reward every time cooperation improves, so their reinforcement is intermittent and somewhat cautious.\n\nThey refrain from rewarding during some full-cooperation episodes, which may reflect uncertainty about the impact of rewards, a desire to conserve payoff, or a belief that verbal and collective norms are sufficient once cooperation is established. They never use rewards punitively or manipulatively (the mechanism is symmetric cost/benefit), and their pattern suggests a primarily prosocial, norm-affirming intent: they are willing to incur small costs to encourage or acknowledge cooperative behavior but do not treat rewarding as a central or heavily strategic tool."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a highly stable, strict full cooperator once coordination on high contributions is achieved. They start with a substantial but not maximal contribution, then quickly shift to and maintain the maximum possible contribution for the remainder of the game, regardless of small deviations by others. Their behavior suggests a strong efficiency norm: they prioritize maximizing group payoffs over personal short-term gain, even when the marginal per-coin return from the public good is below 1 for the contributor. They do not exhibit conditional cooperation in a fine-grained sense; instead, they appear to adopt a simple rule: once most others are fully cooperating, they contribute fully and stay there, tolerating minor free-riding rather than adjusting downward. They show no visible concern for personal exploitation by occasional lower contributors and display no evidence of strategic endgame defection. Risk tolerance seems moderately high in social terms: they are willing to commit to full cooperation early and persistently without first testing whether others will reciprocate beyond an initial partial contribution. Fairness considerations are present but weakly enforced behaviorally: they advocate for equal, maximal contributions but do not change their own contributions when others briefly deviate, suggesting they care more about achieving and maintaining an efficient, cooperative norm than about punishing slight unfairness.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThe player uses brief, directive, pro-cooperation messages aimed at group coordination rather than relationship-building or emotional expression. Their tone is straightforward and mildly exhortative, focused on instructing others to contribute as much as possible for collective gain. They re-emphasize the same cooperative prescription rather than engaging in back-and-forth dialogue or tailoring messages to specific individuals, indicating a low-verbosity, broadcast style rather than interactive conversation. They support and reinforce emerging cooperative norms once they see others aligning with high contributions, but they do not elaborate arguments, explain payoffs in detail, or attempt nuanced persuasion. Their communication shows low responsiveness to others’ specific chat content; they acknowledge the cooperative frame set by others implicitly through their actions, not through direct replies. Overall, they engage enough to signal intentions and set norms, but they do not invest in ongoing social negotiation or conflict management via chat.\n\n<REWARD>\nThe player never uses the available reward mechanism despite consistently high contributions from others and a highly cooperative environment. This suggests a strong preference for conserving personal resources over engaging in costly positive reciprocity; they appear to believe that explicit rewards are unnecessary when cooperative norms are already in place. They do not use rewards strategically to stabilize cooperation or to encourage specific deviators back to the norm, even when minor deviations occur. This may indicate either that they see contribution behavior itself as sufficient mutual support, or that they do not integrate the reward tool into their strategy at all. Their non-use of rewards implies low propensity to engage in second-order cooperation (paying a cost to reinforce cooperative behavior) and a tendency to rely on direct contribution choices rather than meta-level incentives. Their behavior gives no evidence of gratitude signaling through rewards, nor of targeted reinforcement, so their reward strategy is best characterized as consistently inactive or unused.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nUnknown. The player never receives any rewards in the observed game, so there is no evidence about how they respond to being rewarded, whether they would reciprocate toward specific rewarders, or whether they would adjust their contributions or social stance in response. Their reciprocity toward identifiable rewarders, potential alliance-building, or gratitude signaling patterns therefore remain of low-confidence and cannot be inferred from this transcript."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a highly stable, near-unconditional high contributor. After an initial moderate contribution, they quickly move to the maximum possible contribution and then maintain that level with essentially no downward adjustment, even when at least one peer begins to reduce contributions. Their behavior fits a “principled cooperator” or “quasi-unconditional cooperator” type: they prioritize group efficiency and seem committed to a norm of full contribution rather than tailoring their behavior to short-term payoffs.\n\nThey demonstrate strong adherence to an implicit fairness norm in the cooperative phase: when others appear to follow a “everyone contributes the same high amount” standard, they match it rather than exploiting it. When one peer reduces contributions, they do not retaliate or condition their own giving in response; they continue to contribute fully despite the presence of a free-rider. This suggests low sensitivity to mild norm violations, or a willingness to bear some exploitation in order to preserve overall cooperation.\n\nTheir approach shows low risk aversion with respect to being exploited by defectors: they repeatedly expose themselves to the risk that others will benefit disproportionately from their generosity, yet they do not adjust their behavior downward. At the same time, they show no evidence of experimenting with lower contributions to test others’ responses. Overall, they appear guided more by an internal cooperative rule (“contribute fully”) than by reactive or strategic conditional cooperation.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThis player does not use the chat at all in the observed game. They neither initiate coordination nor respond verbally to others’ attempts to organize full contributions. Their cooperative behavior aligns with the cooperative norms some peers advocate, but this alignment is purely behavioral, not communicative.\n\nThe absence of messages makes it unknown whether they are socially reserved, strategically silent, or simply indifferent to chat. They do not publicly praise or criticize others, do not join in encouragement, and do not attempt to sanction or pressure lower contributors via communication. This suggests a low-engagement or passive style in the communication channel: they cooperate consistently but do not use social talk to influence or negotiate group norms.\n\nBecause they never speak, their responsiveness to specific appeals is observable only in their actions: they act in line with high-contribution appeals but never explicitly acknowledge them. Their tone, persuasion style, and willingness to confront or reassure others in chat remain unknown.\n\n<REWARD>\nThis player almost never uses the reward mechanism and appears highly reluctant to spend on rewarding. Across repeated opportunities, they generally choose not to transfer any of their payoff to others, despite facing multiple peers who contribute at the same maximal level as they do. They do not systematically reward high cooperators, even when those cooperators are clearly identifiable and stable.\n\nOn a single occasion, they engage with the reward system in a trivial, payoff-neutral way that results in them both spending and receiving the same small amount. Given the structure of the game and the data available, the direction of that transfer is ambiguous: it may be self-rewarding if that is allowed, or a tiny reward to someone else who simultaneously rewards them. There is no clear pattern of them using reward to reinforce others’ cooperation, nor to build alliances or express gratitude. If they do reward someone else in that instance, it is minimal and does not reflect an ongoing strategy.\n\nOverall, they behave as if reward is either strategically unimportant, too costly relative to its benefit, or simply not salient. They do not appear to use it as a tool to shape behavior, to reciprocate, or to signal approval in any systematic way. Their default is effectively to ignore the reward option.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThey receive an identifiable reward exactly once. Their subsequent behavior does not change: they continue contributing at the same maximal level as before and do not begin to reward others afterwards. There is no clear behavioral evidence of reciprocal rewarding, preferential treatment, or alliance formation with whoever rewarded them (if it was another player). If that transfer is instead self-directed, then there is no external rewarder to respond to.\n\nBecause their cooperation is already at ceiling before and after the reward event, it is impossible to detect any incremental “boost” in contribution caused by being rewarded. They also do not start to spend more on rewards themselves following that experience. Thus, if they appreciate the reward, this appreciation is not expressed through observable strategic changes.\n\nIn new environments with identifiable rewarders, this type is best characterized as non-reactive in material terms: being rewarded does not meaningfully alter their contribution pattern or their use of reward. Their emotional or attitudinal response to being rewarded is unknown; all that is visible is that their cooperative rule (“always contribute fully”) appears independent of whether they are materially recognized for it."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a stable, unconditional cooperator in this environment. They always contribute the full endowment, even when others clearly free-ride, when peers explicitly advocate for non-contribution, and when it is the final round. They do not appear to condition their contributions on past group behavior or on immediate payoffs. Their behavior suggests a strong internal norm that “everyone should contribute” and a willingness to act on that norm regardless of short-term personal gain. They tolerate the risk of being exploited by free-riders and do not visibly adjust toward a more self-protective strategy, indicating either low sensitivity to exploitation, a strong preference for maintaining cooperation, or both. Their fairness norm centers on universal full contribution; they do not express support for retaliatory non-contribution, and they keep cooperating even as others explicitly coordinate to stop.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThey are proactive but succinct in communication. Early on, they initiate interaction and quickly move to a norm-setting attempt, explicitly promoting universal contribution. Throughout, their tone is calm, cooperative, and lightly humorous or understated rather than moralistic or hostile. They engage in simple coordination bids (“we should all contribute,” “let's all contribute”) and later offer a short, reflective comment about the spread of non-cooperation, framing it as “infectious” rather than attacking specific individuals. They respond to evolving group dynamics with brief remarks but do not dominate the chat, argue, or escalate conflict, even when others become insulting or cynical. They do not directly confront individual defectors nor join in calls to “get” or shame them. Overall they show a prosocial, group-oriented communication style with moderate engagement and low aggression.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThey demonstrate awareness that the game has a fixed, short horizon; they acknowledge statements about the total number of rounds and the final round. Despite clear end-game cues and explicit calls from others to stop contributing at the end, their strategy does not decay: they continue to contribute fully in the last rounds, including the very last one. They resist the typical end-game unraveling of cooperation and do not switch to self-interested free-riding even when it is strategically tempting and socially endorsed. There is no visible attempt to exploit remaining cooperators at the end, suggesting that their cooperative behavior is guided more by a stable principle or preference for mutual cooperation than by backward induction.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey never spend on rewards in any round, despite having opportunities and despite receiving rewards themselves. They also explicitly express skepticism about the usefulness of the reward mechanism, stating that they see little or no point in rewarding. This indicates that their decision not to reward is deliberate rather than inattentive. Their non-use of rewards persists even when cooperation is fragile and when reward could, in principle, be used to encourage others. They appear to view contribution itself—and verbal encouragement—as their main cooperative action, rather than using costly reward as a strategic tool. Their stance suggests they are cost-conscious about side mechanisms that do not clearly improve their own or the group’s outcomes, or they simply consider reward redundant or ineffective in this group context.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThey receive rewards from others but never reciprocate with reward spending. They do not explicitly acknowledge being rewarded in chat and do not build visible bilateral alliances with those who reward them. Their cooperative actions remain directed toward the whole group rather than selectively toward rewarders. This pattern suggests low responsiveness to reward as a relational or strategic signal: they continue full cooperation, but not in a way that differentially benefits those who rewarded them. Their primary reciprocity seems to be toward the group-level norm of contribution rather than toward individual benefactors.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey notice and comment selectively on others’ behaviors and implied outcomes. Early on, they focus on setting a cooperative norm rather than on calling out non-contributors by name, leaving that to other players. When one player heavily uses the reward mechanism in a seemingly extreme way, they respond with a mildly curious, lightly teasing question rather than condemnation or praise, indicating social awareness but emotional restraint. Later, as free-riding behavior spreads and one player reaps unusually high payoffs from non-contribution, they describe the pattern as “infectious,” framing it as a group dynamic problem rather than attacking particular individuals. They do not express envy or anger over payoff disparities, and they do not change their own strategy in response to these outcome patterns. Overall, they register others’ outcomes, comment in a low-key and sometimes humorous manner, but maintain their own cooperative course without retaliatory or compensatory moves."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a stable, unconditional full contributor. They always give their entire endowment to the public fund and do not reduce contributions in response to repeated and persistent free‑riding by another player or to cooperation decay by some others later in the game. Their behavior suggests they prioritize maximizing group welfare over their own short‑term material payoff, even when the marginal per‑coin return is lower than the private return and others are not fully cooperative. They explicitly express a belief that universal full contribution produces high payoffs for everyone and that contributing fully “still helps in the long run,” indicating an understanding of the payoff structure and a forward‑looking, efficiency‑oriented mindset. They do not display conditional cooperation or reciprocity in their contribution levels: their giving is insensitive to others’ deviations, including late‑game breakdowns. This pattern is consistent with a principled or norm‑driven cooperator rather than a payoff‑maximizing strategist. Their risk tolerance appears high with respect to exploitation: they continue to expose themselves to free‑riding without adjustment. Concerns about fairness are present in their comments about some “hurting everyone,” but these fairness concerns do not translate into any reduction in their own contribution, suggesting they treat contribution as a moral or fixed rule rather than a tool for enforcing fairness.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nTheir tone is friendly, upbeat, and lightly humorous, with some informal language and typos suggesting spontaneous rather than over‑calculated communication. They actively attempt to coordinate and persuade others toward universal cooperation, providing simple, outcome‑oriented arguments about how everyone benefits if all give fully. Early on, they try to explain the benefit magnitude, correcting their own earlier miscalculation, which indicates a desire to be accurate and transparent with others. They encourage others explicitly to keep contributing fully even when some players do not, framing it as beneficial “in the long run,” which reveals an effort to maintain group morale and a cooperative norm. They also speculate that some low contributors “might be bots,” which distances them somewhat from the defectors and aligns them socially with the high contributors. They engage readily with at least one other cooperative player, responding to comments, agreeing about preferences for sanctioning low contributors, and sharing a light “lol” exchange, indicating a sociable and affiliative style. They do not confront defectors directly or individually; instead, they speak to the group in general, using inclusive language (“everyone,” “y’all”) and thanking “everyone that’s giving all.” At the end, they thank all participants and mildly lament that some “not very nice folk” are present, which is a soft, non‑aggressive expression of disapproval. Overall, they are engaged, coordination‑oriented, and prosocial in tone, with a mild but not punitive moral stance.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThey show clear awareness that the game has a known, finite horizon; they explicitly reference the number of players and rounds and respond when another player notes that the game is “almost done.” Despite this awareness, they do not reduce contributions toward the end and continue to give fully in the final rounds, including when others’ cooperation temporarily collapses. There is no evidence of end‑game defection or even hedging; their contribution strategy remains fixed. They maintain a polite, appreciative tone up to the final round, then close with thanks and a brief negative comment about some participants’ behavior, suggesting emotional awareness of others’ choices but no strategic adjustment in response. Their behavior is consistent with an end‑game‑insensitive, rule‑following cooperator: they appear to treat “always give” as the correct strategy regardless of the remaining number of rounds. Any implicit frustration with defectors emerges only as verbal commentary, not as a behavioral shift in contributions or reward use.\n\n<REWARD>\nTheir use of the reward mechanism is limited and selective. They give rewards only in a couple of instances and never at high intensity. They do not appear to reward systematically in proportion to others’ contributions, nor do they use rewards regularly to build a clear alliance or to maintain cooperation levels. Instead, their occasional rewards seem to serve as sporadic positive reinforcement or recognition for cooperative behavior rather than as a calculated investment. They never use reward to retaliate or to strategically steer specific borderline contributors; they also do not appear to adjust their reward use over time in response to continued free‑riding. The overall pattern suggests that they conceptually support the idea of positive reinforcement but either find the cost structure unattractive, choose to conserve coins, or simply do not prioritize reward as a central tool. Their comments about wishing they could “take away points rather than give” indicate a latent interest in punitive mechanisms rather than costly positive rewards when others persistently defect, although they do not have access to punishment in this game. Thus, they are primarily a contributor, secondarily and weakly a rewarder, and conceptually open to punishment as a more satisfying or effective enforcement mechanism.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThey receive rewards in several rounds from others. There is no explicit, direct verbal gratitude directed at specific rewarders; they do not name them or acknowledge them individually in chat. Their high and stable contributions begin before any rewards arrive and continue regardless of whether they are rewarded, so their cooperative behavior is not contingent on receiving reward. They also do not clearly reciprocate by rewarding those who reward them; their own reward episodes are sparse and do not obviously map onto incoming rewards, so any reciprocity is at best weak or unknown. Socially, they maintain a friendly and cooperative interaction with at least one other cooperative player who also rewards them at times, which might reflect an implicit mutual‑support cluster, but this cannot be firmly established. Overall, when rewarded, they continue behaving as before—fully cooperative and generally positive—without visible strategic adjustment or explicit expressions of alliance building. Their response profile fits a norm‑driven cooperator who appreciates prosocial peers in general but does not strongly condition behavior on being rewarded and does not systematically engage in reward‑based reciprocity."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a strict, unconditional high contributor. They always give the full endowment to the public fund and never experiment with lower contributions, even when others free-ride or cooperation temporarily collapses. Their behavior suggests a strong internal norm that “the right thing” is to contribute fully, relatively insensitive to immediate personal payoff. They show no evidence of conditional cooperation based on others’ exact contribution levels; instead, they maintain full cooperation through both cooperative and non-cooperative phases. They accept the risk that others might exploit their contributions and do not adjust in response to repeated low contributions from one group member or sudden drops from others. Fairness matters to them at an expressive level (they comment when others do not “play along”), but they do not translate fairness concerns into retaliatory contribution cuts. Overall, they behave as a principled cooperator with high risk tolerance for being exploited and low responsiveness of contributions to others’ behavior.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nTheir communication is brief, positive, and group-oriented. They endorse the cooperative plan early, signaling alignment with full contributions without pushing their own agenda. When others deviate, they acknowledge it with light humor rather than anger, indicating mild frustration but a desire to keep the atmosphere friendly. They explicitly express appreciation for cooperative teammates, reinforcing group cohesion verbally. They also joke about wanting to punish free riders, which shows they care about norm enforcement but keep the tone playful rather than hostile. They respond to others’ comments and build on them, rather than ignoring the chat, indicating engagement and social awareness. Near the end, they make a casual remark about the game nearly being over, which shows awareness of the horizon but no attempt to coordinate an end-game defection. Overall, their style is sociable, affiliative, and cooperative, using light humor and gratitude rather than pressure or moralizing.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThey show explicit awareness of the finite horizon but do not adjust their cooperative strategy as the end approaches. Contributions remain maximized through all phases, including after noticeable declines in group contributions and in the last few rounds. There is no evidence of end-game unraveling or strategic defection; they do not attempt to “cash out” in later rounds. Instead, they maintain the same cooperative pattern and a friendly tone about the game nearing completion. This suggests that their motivation is more norm-driven or identity-driven than strategically forward-looking in the standard economic sense; the impending end does not override their commitment to full cooperation. They appear more interested in sustaining a cooperative identity than in exploiting the final rounds.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey are willing to spend substantially on rewarding others, despite the fact that the reward technology is personally costly and inefficient. They do not use rewards early, even when cooperation is high, suggesting that they do not see small, ongoing rewards as necessary to sustain already-strong cooperation. Instead, their major reward outlays appear concentrated in situations where cooperative behavior becomes more fragile or where a subset of players continues to contribute highly while others shirk. This pattern suggests they use rewards as a way to recognize and support loyal cooperators when they are under strain, rather than as a continuous incentive scheme. They show no sign of using rewards tactically to curry favor for future material gain; they continue to fully cooperate regardless of being rewarded or not. Their reward behavior reflects expressive gratitude and norm support rather than payoff-maximizing strategy.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThey receive rewards on a few occasions but never comment explicitly about being rewarded, never name their benefactor, and do not verbally reciprocate. It is unknown whether they can identify exactly who rewarded them in each instance, but their silence suggests they do not treat the reward as the basis for an explicit alliance. Nevertheless, their overall rewarding behavior appears aligned with supporting high contributors generally, which likely includes those who rewarded them. Thus, any reciprocity is indirect and norm-based rather than personalized or negotiated. Being rewarded does not visibly alter their contribution pattern, which is already maximized, nor does it trigger a clear change in their reward spending trajectory. Their cooperation therefore seems robust to the presence or absence of personal recognition, with gratitude expressed more collectively (“appreciate y’all”) than individually."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a highly cooperative “steadfast contributor” with a single brief defection. They consistently give the full endowment to the public fund almost every round, indicating a strong preference for collective efficiency over short‑term private gain. Their pattern is extremely stable: they do not gradually decrease contributions in response to a persistent low contributor, and they do not condition their level on small variations in others’ behavior. They appear to treat full contribution as the baseline norm, rather than something contingent on strict fairness or equal treatment.\n\nThey do briefly switch to zero contribution once late in the game, then immediately return to full contributions. The most plausible interpretation is a one‑off test or opportunistic free ride rather than a full strategy shift: there is no sustained lowering or tit‑for‑tat pattern before or after. This suggests they understand that free riding can be profitable but still choose to cooperate almost all the time.\n\nGiven the public-good multiplier, full contribution is individually costly relative to free riding but socially efficient. Their willingness to keep contributing at the maximum despite chronic undercontribution by one peer shows tolerance for disadvantageous inequity and a low sensitivity to being exploited. They do not seem risk‑averse about others’ cooperation: they continue to bet on group contribution even when evidence of full unanimity is weak. They appear to implicitly endorse a fairness norm that “everyone should give all” but are willing to maintain that norm unilaterally rather than punishing or withdrawing when others fall short.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThis player does not send any chat messages. They neither respond to others’ attempts at coordination nor initiate talk about strategy, fairness, or reciprocity. This suggests a low‑engagement or observer communication style: they follow along behaviorally but do not participate verbally.\n\nTheir silence persists even when others explicitly address group norms, express frustration about low contributors, or make light social comments. They do not offer thanks when the group is appreciative, do not complain, and do not comment on end‑game or rewards. This makes them hard to read socially and suggests that their cooperative behavior is not driven by overt norm enforcement or reputation‑building through talk.\n\nThe lack of communication also means they do not try to persuade low contributors, coordinate end‑game tactics, or signal intentions. Any beliefs or strategies they hold are implemented purely through actions, not words. They appear comfortable letting others lead in norm‑setting while simply aligning (or not) through their contribution decisions.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThe player clearly perceives the finite horizon (the interface shows remaining rounds), and their behavior reflects some horizon awareness but with only a modest end‑game effect. For most of the game, including late rounds, they maintain full contributions. They do not exhibit the classic gradual decay of cooperation as the end approaches.\n\nThe single zero‑contribution move occurs relatively late, then is followed by a return to full contributions in subsequent rounds, including the final round. This indicates that any end‑game opportunism is weak and short‑lived rather than a planned unraveling. They do not escalate free riding as the last round comes into view, nor do they attempt a coordinated high‑cooperation “finish”; they simply revert to their prior cooperative pattern.\n\nOverall, they act as if sustaining a cooperative norm is valuable even near the end, and they do not strongly exploit the final rounds despite the absence of future interaction. Any learning or adaptation to others’ persistent undercontribution manifests minimally; they continue to “play their game” almost unchanged through to the end.\n\n<REWARD>\nThis player never spends anything on rewards, despite having repeated opportunities and clear examples of high cooperators they could reward. They do, however, receive rewards multiple times. The absence of outgoing rewards, even toward consistently generous others, suggests they do not use the reward mechanism as a tool for norm reinforcement or reciprocity.\n\nSeveral interpretations are consistent with the data and cannot be fully disentangled: they may view reward as too costly given its inefficiency; they may not see reward as necessary when others are already cooperating; or they may be generally uninterested in active sanctioning systems. What is clear is that their cooperative stance in contributions does not extend into costly positive sanctioning.\n\nTheir behavior therefore fits a “pure cooperator, non‑rewarder” pattern: they contribute highly but do not invest in incentivizing others. They rely on direct contribution choices, not metastrategic tools like rewards, to shape group outcomes.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThe player receives identifiable rewards from at least one cooperator but shows no observable behavioral or communicative response. They do not increase their contribution level afterward (it is already at ceiling), and they do not start rewarding in return. Their single deviation to zero contribution is not clearly linked to the timing of being rewarded, and they resume full cooperation regardless of reward flows. This indicates that their contribution strategy is effectively insensitive to being rewarded; they are already committed to high cooperation and do not adjust in response to positive reinforcement.\n\nThey also do not send chat messages acknowledging or thanking the rewarder, nor do they attempt to form an explicit alliance with high contributors. There is no targeted reciprocity via the reward channel. Their stance appears to be: continue contributing maximally because that is their chosen norm, independent of who rewards whom. In new environments with identifiable rewarders, this type is likely to appreciate rewards only passively (through payoff gains), without using them as a basis for coalition‑building or strategic behavioral shifts."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a steadfast high contributor who always gives the full endowment to the public fund. Their behavior is extremely stable and does not react to others’ deviations: they continue maximal contributions even when one peer persistently free rides and others occasionally reduce their own contributions. They appear to follow a cooperative norm based on “what is socially best” rather than on narrow payoff maximization, because the contribution pattern is strictly dominated given the MPCR and other players’ behavior. There is no evidence that they condition their own contribution on fairness, reciprocity, or punishment/reward prospects; their strategy is essentially unconditional full cooperation. Risk tolerance is high in the social sense: they are willing to expose themselves to exploitation and do not hedge by lowering contributions, even when cooperation in the group becomes weaker late in the game.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThe player communicates very sparsely and with low assertiveness. They briefly affirm the cooperative plan proposed by another player and otherwise mostly observe the ongoing conversation among others. They do not attempt to persuade, coordinate, or call out free riders, even when others complain or express frustration. The tone is neutral to mildly positive and non-confrontational. They show some minimal social engagement, acknowledging the cooperative norm, but avoid leading, arguing, or enforcing norms in chat. Overall, they present as agreeable, quiet, and conflict-avoidant, preferring to cooperate through actions rather than words.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThe player shows no visible end-game defection. Contributions remain fully cooperative through the final rounds, including after other players start lowering contributions substantially and as the remaining-round count becomes clearly small. There is no sign of horizon-based strategizing or attempt to “cash out” in late rounds by reducing contributions. Instead, they maintain their established cooperative pattern until the game ends. They also do not adjust their reward behavior in a clear, systematic way near the end; end-game awareness does not appear to alter their strategic stance.\n\n<REWARD>\nThe player is generally restrained in using rewards but is willing to spend heavily on them in a few instances. They do not reward in most rounds, despite stable high cooperation by several peers, which suggests that reward is not used as a routine reciprocity tool. However, when they do reward, they commit substantial resources, sacrificing a large fraction of their payoff to transfer positive payoffs to others even though the reward mechanism is efficiency-reducing. This indicates a willingness to incur significant personal cost to support or signal appreciation to cooperators, independent of strict payoff efficiency. The timing suggests that rewards are triggered by persistent cooperation in the face of free riding and by group-level strain on the cooperative norm, but exact internal criteria are unknown. Their rewards are more altruistic/expressive than strategically optimized, and there is no clear evidence they fine-tune reward amounts in response to minor contribution differences.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThe player does receive rewards in several rounds, but they do not change their contribution behavior afterward, since they are already at maximal contribution both before and after being rewarded. There is no observable shift toward systematically rewarding those who rewarded them, so direct reciprocal “you rewarded me, I reward you” behavior is unknown or at best low-confidence. They also do not verbally acknowledge being rewarded, so gratitude signaling in chat is absent. Their main form of “response” to rewarders is simply to continue fully cooperating, which is indistinguishable from their baseline strategy; thus, any internal sense of alliance or special favoritism toward rewarders remains unknown."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player fits a “talk-cooperative, mildly opportunistic” type. They show a strong initial willingness to fully cooperate, contributing their entire endowment even when others do not all match that level. They appear to internalize and endorse a full-contribution norm once it is discussed, actively supporting it in chat. However, their behavior is not perfectly stable: after explicitly signaling an intention to contribute the maximum, they then contribute less than that statement. This suggests some readiness to quietly deviate from a stated cooperative norm when it benefits them and when sanction risk appears low or ambiguous. Their contributions are clearly conditional on group discussion and perceived agreement; they do not unilaterally reduce contributions in response to others’ moderate deviations but do show that their stated intentions and actual actions can diverge. Fairness norms are present in their language (supporting equal, maximal contributions for everyone), but their revealed preferences indicate a willingness to shave their own contribution while still benefiting from others’ higher giving. Risk tolerance appears moderate: they are willing to contribute fully when they believe the group is aligned, but later reduce contributions in a context of emerging uncertainty about adherence to the norm and about the use of punishment. Overall, they are cooperative-leaning but not strictly norm-following, capable of small-scale free-riding when the opportunity arises.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThey communicate in a brief, directive, and highly coordination-focused style. Early on, they propose concrete contribution levels and quickly escalate their recommendation to a clear, maximal standard, emphasizing group uniformity. Their tone is enthusiastic and emphatic rather than cautious or analytical, favoring decisive statements over detailed reasoning. They actively engage with others’ suggestions, quickly aligning with proposals that move toward higher cooperation, and they visibly confirm agreement in real time. They also provide short explanations about their own action constraints (such as timing issues), indicating a concern with how others perceive their reliability and intent. Their engagement is social but instrumental: messages are aimed at securing a common plan and maintaining a sense of joint commitment. They do not challenge or criticize others directly and avoid confrontation in chat, even when others’ statements may be inaccurate relative to actual contributions. This points to a preference for positive coordination and face-saving rather than policing or calling out discrepancies publicly.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey never use the punishment option, despite being in situations where others contribute less than the emerging full-cooperation norm and despite explicit discussion by another player about using deductions as a sanction for low contributors. Their non-use of punishment persists when free-riding is observable and when a credible argument for norm enforcement is raised. This suggests either a reluctance to spend personal resources on enforcement, a general aversion to punitive actions, or uncertainty about whether punishing is appropriate or effective in this environment. They also do not join in the rhetorical push for punishment; they neither endorse nor oppose it explicitly. There is no evidence of retaliatory motives; they are not punished by others and never respond with punishment. Their pattern fits a “non-punishing cooperator” type: they prefer that norms be supported via communication and mutual agreement rather than through costly sanctions, and they tolerate some deviation without enforcing deterrence.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey observe that others sometimes earn more than they do and that contributions and payoffs vary across players and rounds, yet they show no explicit emotional or strategic reaction in chat to these differences. They do not comment on others’ higher or lower payoffs, nor on the absence of punishment across the group. When another player misperceives the group’s behavior as fully cooperative, they do not correct this, even though the payoff information reveals deviations. This indicates a low tendency to publicly scrutinize or contest outcome distributions. Their one ex-post comment is about their own process constraint (a timeout), not about fairness or inequity. Taken together, this suggests that they accept realized outcomes with minimal overt response, prioritize maintaining a cooperative narrative over highlighting discrepancies, and refrain from outcome-based blame or enforcement, even when they could potentially justify it. Their learning from outcomes is opaque from the data: they do adjust their own contribution, but they do not articulate that adjustment in terms of observed payoffs, leaving their internal updating process unknown or low-confidence."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThe player is a stable, unconditional high contributor. They always invest the full endowment into the public good, with no observable sensitivity to others’ defection patterns or to the game’s remaining length. They do not appear to condition their contribution on recent under-provision by specific peers or on perceived unfairness in payoffs. This indicates a strong cooperative norm that overrides short-term self-interest and any inclination to match others’ lower contributions. Risk tolerance for being exploited by free-riders is high; they continue to fully cooperate even when one or more players repeatedly contribute nothing. There is no observable attempt to “discipline” defectors via reduced contributions; instead, they separate their cooperation decision from others’ behavior and from any strategic calculation about marginal returns at different stages of the game.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThe player does not use the chat function at all (or such messages are absent from the transcript), so their explicit communication style is unknown. They neither affirm others’ cooperation proposals nor publicly protest defection or reward patterns. This silence suggests either a preference for nonverbal signaling through actions (contributions and rewards) or low engagement with social coordination via chat. They do not correct others’ misattributions or confusion, even when other players reference them or mix up names, implying low concern for managing others’ perceptions via words or a passive stance in group discourse.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThere is no visible end-game defection or tapering of cooperation. The player continues to contribute fully through the final rounds with no apparent adjustment as the horizon approaches, despite knowing the total number of rounds. Their reward behavior also does not converge to a clear “last-round” shutdown; instead, they sometimes continue to spend on rewards near the end and sometimes refrain, consistent with their earlier pattern of variable but recurring reward use. This suggests that they do not adopt a backward-induction logic or a classic end-game “grab” strategy. Their cooperative and rewarding tendencies appear driven more by a stable internal norm or preference than by forward-looking, horizon-sensitive optimization.\n\n<REWARD>\nThe player is generally willing to spend on rewards, often at nontrivial personal cost, but not in every round and not in a mechanically consistent way. They are more likely to reward when all or most others contribute fully and less likely to reward in mixed-contribution environments where some defect. They rarely, if ever, reward noncontributors; observed rewards tend to go to peers who are cooperating. This indicates that they use rewards as positive reinforcement for cooperative behavior, aligning with a prosocial norm-reinforcement strategy. At times they allocate rewards widely across multiple cooperators, and at other times they reward more selectively or not at all, suggesting some fluctuation in motivation, attention, or perceived need for reinforcement rather than a fixed rule like “always reward all cooperators.” They are willing to incur substantial cumulative cost on rewards across the game, implying that they place value on expressing approval or fostering group cooperation even when the direct payoff return is neutral under this reward technology.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThe player is repeatedly the recipient of rewards from others, but their behavioral response is not tightly reciprocal in a dyadic or tit-for-tat sense. They do not systematically channel more rewards back to those who reward them, nor do they clearly form an exclusive “reward alliance” with any single partner. Instead, their pattern suggests generalized reciprocity or group-level gratitude: when they do reward, they usually direct it toward cooperators broadly rather than purely to prior reward-givers. There is no evidence of retaliating against, ignoring, or favoring specific individuals strictly based on prior reward history. Their continued full contribution regardless of who rewards them also indicates that they do not condition basic cooperation on being rewarded.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThe player consistently observes detailed information about others’ contributions, payoffs, and reward expenditures, yet does not visibly adjust core cooperation in response. They tolerate others earning higher payoffs (especially high-earning defectors or low spenders on rewards) without reducing their own contribution level. This shows low reactivity to inequity in terms of contribution-return ratios. Their reward allocations, however, do appear loosely sensitive to others’ choices: they more readily reward those who both contribute and are not obviously shirking, and they do not systematically “top up” disadvantaged but cooperative players versus advantaged ones—status equalization is not clearly their objective. They do not use rewards to “punish” via omission in a strong, consistent way, but free-riders tend to be left without positive reinforcement when the player is spending, which can act as a mild social signal. Overall, they respond to others’ outcomes more by quietly adjusting where they send positive signals than by altering their own contribution or engaging in overt sanctioning.\n\n"

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a generally high contributor with moderate downward flexibility. They usually give more than or close to the group average, often at or near full contribution, but occasionally cut back substantially. Their baseline seems to be a “cooperative but not unconditional” stance: they appear willing to forego private payoff to support the public fund, especially when others also contribute strongly.\n\nContribution levels are not chaotic; they vary within a band rather than swinging between extremes every round. Larger drops occur after stretches where the player has already contributed a lot and/or engaged in costly punishment, suggesting some sensitivity to their own payoff position and possible “fatigue” with shouldering the cooperative burden alone.\n\nThey appear conditionally cooperative: when others continue to contribute at high and stable levels, they are happy to match or exceed that. When others’ average contributions sag but remain decent, the player sometimes reduces their own contribution while still staying within the cooperative range. They do not appear to exploit others’ very high contributions by repeatedly free-riding; low contributions are occasional and not a persistent strategy.\n\nThey seem to have a fairness norm centered on “everyone should at least give solid amounts.” Players who consistently give much more (especially full contributors) are treated as especially virtuous. The focal player tolerates some asymmetry but reacts sharply to one specific moderate contributor who also benefits from the public good without matching the cooperative effort of the highest contributors; this indicates a dislike of systematic advantage-taking rather than of any deviation per se.\n\nRisk tolerance seems moderate: they are willing to invest heavily into the public fund even without guarantees of reciprocity, but occasionally protect their own payoff by contributing less, especially after investing in costly punishment or when it is unclear whether high cooperation will persist.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThis player uses punishment actively but very selectively, focusing almost exclusively on a single target. They are clearly willing to incur personal costs to reduce another’s payoff, and they escalate the intensity over time. The target is not the lowest contributor in the group; instead, it is a consistent moderate contributor who tends to earn relatively high payoffs. The focal player does not punish other moderate or low contributors who play similarly, nor do they punish high contributors, indicating that they are not using punishment as a general tool to enforce uniform high contributions.\n\nTheir pattern is consistent with a personalized, norm‑enforcing or expressive motive toward that specific player: “you, in particular, should not be allowed to keep doing this.” The repeated focus and occasional escalation suggest they are trying to influence that player’s behavior or reduce an outcome they see as unfair, rather than simply venting once. The absence of punishment toward anyone else, even when they contribute similarly, shows high selectivity and some internal rule about who “deserves” sanctions.\n\nThere is no evidence of retaliatory punishment, because the focal player is never punished by others. Accordingly, their punishment motive cannot be described as revenge‑driven. Instead, it appears mixed: partly inequity aversion (dislike of that player’s relatively favorable payoff position given their contributions), and partly a desire to deter that player from continuing a pattern the focal player finds objectionable.\n\nThey are willing to spend substantial cumulative resources on punishment, even when it reduces their own payoff noticeably, which indicates that enforcing their perceived fairness standard can override short‑term self‑interest. At the same time, they eventually discontinue punishing once the target’s contributions and the overall group pattern become stable and acceptable to them, suggesting some capacity to “declare victory” or at least to stop escalating indefinitely.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nUnknown. The focal player is never punished in this transcript, so their reactions to being sanctioned—whether they would comply, retaliate, or forgive—cannot be inferred. Any assumptions about their response to punishment would be low confidence and speculative.\n\n<REWARD>\nThe player is clearly willing to reward and does so in a pattern consistent with “pro‑social reinforcement.” They direct rewards to those who contribute at or near full levels and who appear to sustain group welfare. They do not reward moderate or low contributors, even when those individuals are not being punished, indicating that their standard for positive reinforcement is reserved for the very cooperative.\n\nRewarding is intermittent: they do not reward every time someone contributes highly, nor do they reward all high contributors in a given round. This suggests they treat rewards as a targeted, somewhat scarce signal rather than an automatic rule. They may be using reward both to express appreciation and to encourage sustained high contributions from particular players who have been especially consistent.\n\nThere is no evidence they use rewards strategically to manipulate more selfish players into contributing more; instead, they focus on already‑good cooperators. That is more consistent with helping “heroes” than recruiting “defectors.” Given the positive payoff cost of rewarding, they accept a reduction in their own earnings to support and recognize high cooperators, but they do this sporadically rather than continuously, perhaps balancing altruistic signaling with payoff concerns.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nUnknown. The focal player is never rewarded by others in this transcript, so their behavioral or strategic response to receiving rewards—whether they would reciprocate, increase contributions, or form implicit alliances—cannot be inferred.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThe player pays close attention to others’ contributions and resulting payoffs and appears sensitive to the relationship between effort and reward. When high contributors earn moderate or even slightly lower payoffs than some moderate contributors, the focal player intervenes, particularly against the moderate contributor whose earnings often compare favorably despite giving less than the top cooperators. This implies strong outcome‑based fairness concerns with an emphasis on relative payoffs.\n\nThey never sanction or reward based purely on outcome size: they do not attack those with the very highest payoffs when these are paired with high contributions, nor do they protect lower earners if those are also low contributors. Their responses are tied to the pattern “contribution level vs. resulting payoff,” not payoff alone.\n\nThe player seems comfortable with a differentiated outcome structure where high cooperators do well, moderate cooperators do reasonably, and no one is singled out without a behavioral basis. Once the group settles into a stable, high‑contribution equilibrium and the previously targeted player behaves in line with that standard, the focal player stops using punishment and cuts back on reward use as well. That suggests that they primarily deploy sanctions and rewards as tools to adjust the group toward a desired cooperative and fair pattern, and when that pattern is achieved, they revert to simpler contribution decisions without extra costly interventions.\n\nOverall, this player type is a conditionally cooperative, fairness‑oriented enforcer who uses both reward and targeted punishment to shape others’ behavior and relative payoffs, prioritizing alignment between contributions and outcomes over maximizing their own earnings."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThe player is a “conditional high contributor with intermittent free-riding and sensitivity to norms.” They demonstrate a clear willingness to cooperate: they choose the cooperative option substantially more often than not and repeatedly sustain full contributions even when others do not match them. This suggests they value collective efficiency and are not purely self-interested in the short term.\n\nTheir contributions are conditional, not rigid. They occasionally switch to zero when others’ cooperation looks fragile or uneven. These non-contribution choices cluster after exposure to low contributions or punishment aimed at them, indicating that they condition behavior on perceived fairness and on how they are treated. However, they do not adopt a simple tit-for-tat rule; after free-riding, they readily return to full contribution, even while some peers still contribute little. This points to a flexible, exploratory strategy rather than a strict rule-based one.\n\nThey appear to hold a fairness norm where full or near-full contribution by most players is the reference point. When the group approximates that norm, they reliably cooperate. When contributions are uneven or declining, they tolerate some level of free-riding by others but sometimes temporarily free-ride themselves, likely balancing payoff and frustration. Their willingness to keep contributing in the presence of multiple low contributors suggests a relatively high tolerance for inequality, provided that overall cooperation remains substantial.\n\nRisk tolerance is moderate to high: they contribute fully many times when the strategic environment is uncertain and they have already experienced being punished themselves. They accept the risk of being exploited in order to support or probe for a cooperative standard, instead of defaulting to self-protection. At the same time, their occasional zero contributions indicate they are not a naïve unconditional cooperator; they do protect their own payoff when norms look unstable or when they have just borne unfair costs.\n\nOverall, their contribution pattern is mixed but biased toward cooperation, with adjustments that appear responsive to perceived group norms and personal treatment rather than purely to immediate monetary incentives.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThe player shows clear awareness of the finite horizon and does not exhibit pure end-game unraveling. In late rounds, they continue to make cooperative choices in several instances, including in the final round, even after episodes of being punished and after some periods in which they themselves free-ride. This indicates that they do not strictly follow backward-induction logic that would dictate universal defection near the end.\n\nInstead, they appear to use the late game to either reinforce or test norms one last time. They continue to contribute fully in multiple late rounds despite mixed cooperation from others and despite prior punishment aimed at them when they free-rode. This persistence suggests that they maintain a preference for achieving or maintaining a cooperative outcome up to the end, not just early on.\n\nTheir behavior across the final several rounds alternates between cooperation and free-riding, but they finish the game by cooperating and also spending on punishment in the very last round. This pattern is consistent with a player who remains engaged with norm enforcement and group outcomes until the last opportunity, rather than “cashing out” entirely. It suggests that they derive some utility from upholding a cooperative standard or from sanctioning norm violators, even when there is no future round in which to reap discipline-driven benefits.\n\nThey do not show a strong decay in contributions that monotonically accelerates towards the final round. Instead, their contributions fluctuate but repeatedly rebound. This indicates that their strategy in the end game emphasizes expressing or stabilizing norms more than exploiting the final stage.\n\nOverall, they treat the end game as still meaningful for both contribution and punishment decisions, implying horizon awareness but only partial adoption of standard end-game defection logic.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThe player is an “active but selective norm enforcer.” They are clearly willing to incur personal costs to punish, and they do so in multiple, separated episodes across the game rather than as a one-off reaction. This repeated willingness to spend suggests a stable readiness to use sanctions as a strategic tool, not merely a single burst of emotion.\n\nPunishment behavior appears primarily linked to deviations from a cooperative norm. They tend to punish in periods where some players are contributing less than what looks like the emerging standard of full or near-full contribution. They do not punish continuously whenever any low contribution exists, which indicates selectivity and some thresholding rather than indiscriminate hostility. The selectivity suggests they may target more persistent or salient low contributors, or times when free-riding is especially at odds with the group pattern. The exact targeting is unknown, but their repeated punishment in such contexts is consistent with a desire to deter free-riding and reinforce cooperation.\n\nThey also continue to punish later in the game, including in the final round, which cannot influence future behavior. This willingness to punish when no future benefits are available points to motives beyond instrumental deterrence. It is consistent with expressive or retributive motives: they may value enforcing fairness or “doing justice” even absent strategic payoff. At the same time, earlier punishment episodes, when future rounds remain, can plausibly have a deterrence component. Thus their punishment motives appear mixed: partly strategic, partly norm- or emotion-driven.\n\nTheir punishment is not tightly coupled to being punished themselves. They are punished in several rounds but do not always respond with punishment immediately afterward, and they also punish in rounds where they are not freshly targeted. This weak link between experienced sanctions and subsequent punishment suggests they are not purely retaliatory or spiteful in a personal sense; they seem more focused on contribution patterns than on revenge. However, because punishers are anonymous, they cannot target specific punishers, which limits our ability to infer responses to specific individuals; any interpretation of retaliatory motives remains low confidence.\n\nThey do not appear to combine non-contribution with punishment in a consistent pattern (such as always free-riding while punishing low contributors), which would be characteristic of “selfish punishers.” Instead, they often punish while also contributing fully, a hallmark of “altruistic punishment” types in PGGs. This combination—bearing both contribution and punishment costs—matches a persona that cares about upholding group-beneficial norms even at personal expense.\n\nOverall, they function as a conditional cooperator who is willing to enforce cooperation via costly punishment, with motives that likely blend instrumental norm support with a fairness or reciprocity ethic."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a flexible conditional cooperator with opportunistic streaks and clear sensitivity to the partner’s past behavior. They alternate between full defection and full cooperation rather than using intermediate levels (forced binary choice here, but they also switch cleanly between the two options). Early on, they free-ride even when the partner fully cooperates, suggesting that initial priorities are self-payoff and exploitation rather than fairness. When the partner mirrors them with low contribution, they immediately accept mutual defection and do not try to unilaterally restore cooperation. Later, once mutual cooperation is established, they reliably match the partner’s high contribution for an extended stretch, indicating that they are willing to sustain efficient cooperation when it is reciprocal and not being “taxed” by punishment. They also revert to defection once, despite the partner still cooperating, indicating that they are not rigidly norm-driven; they are willing to take a profitable deviation when not recently punished and when they perceive the relationship as relatively stable. Overall, they display low intrinsic fairness concern but moderate willingness to cooperate when treated as an equal, and they appear comfortable with payoff asymmetries in their favor.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThe player is clearly aware of the finite horizon (they see the round index and behave differently near the end). In the final portion of the game, they maintain high contributions instead of decaying to defection, despite having been punished in the past. This suggests that they do not use the standard backward-induction style collapse of cooperation; rather, they keep cooperating when mutual cooperation is in place, even as the end approaches. However, they increase the use of punishment again at the very end despite ongoing cooperation, suggesting that end-game for them is a time to settle scores or reassert norms rather than to maximize joint payoff. There is no evidence that they try to exploit the partner via last-round defection; they instead combine full cooperation with renewed punishment, indicating that “final word” in the punishment domain matters more than squeezing out last-round material advantage.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThe player is a willing punisher whose use of punishment is not tightly tied to contemporaneous contribution behavior. They punish after being punished themselves, with no change in the partner’s contribution pattern to justify it, consistent with a retaliatory or expressive motive rather than pure norm enforcement. They never punish for low contributions by the partner (which essentially never happen after the very early game), so there is no evidence of classic altruistic punishment against free-riders. Instead, they direct punishment at a consistently high-contributing partner, repeatedly and at nontrivial personal cost, even when mutual cooperation is strong. This pattern suggests spite, retribution, or an attempt to “even out” earlier perceived unfairness in how punishment was used against them. The punishment is selective (only the partner, never self and never omitted when they choose to use it) but not clearly calibrated to current deviations; it appears history-dependent and emotionally driven rather than forward-looking deterrence. Their choice to stop punishing for a while, then resume, suggests dynamic emotional thresholds: they can suspend hostility when the interaction is calm, but grievances resurface and are expressed through sanctioning even in cooperative states.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nWhen punished early on while defecting against a cooperator, the player does not immediately adjust in a straightforward compliant way; they continue to defect at first, then later shift to cooperation once mutual defection appears and the partner stops using punishments. This delayed adjustment implies that punishment alone does not compel immediate norm compliance; instead, the player seems to react to the broader interaction pattern (including the partner’s eventual change in contribution) rather than the sanction per se. They never punish the partner in the same periods as they are punished; their retaliatory punishment comes later, once they themselves are cooperating and the partner has ceased punishing. This indicates that they remember being targeted and eventually respond with their own sanctions, but not in an immediate tit-for-tat fashion. They do not escalate into punishment wars when directly attacked; rather, they absorb punishment at first, later retaliate in a separate phase, and then partially de-escalate again. There is no evidence of forgiveness in the sense of forgoing retaliation; instead, they compartmentalize their response over time, suggesting long memory and a tendency to “settle accounts” when conditions are safe (i.e., without risking immediate further punishment).\n\n<REWARD>\nThe player never uses the reward option despite multiple opportunities and despite long stretches where the partner contributes maximally and does not punish. This indicates a very low propensity for positive reciprocity via material rewards. Even when the partner behaves cooperatively and refrains from sanctions, the player does not invest to reinforce or acknowledge this behavior. Their social control toolkit is one-sided: they are willing to impose costly punishment but unwilling to spend even minimal resources to reward. This pattern is consistent with a type that views the game primarily through a payoffs-and-grievances lens, not through gratitude or alliance-building. It also suggests that if they wish to signal approval or cooperation, they prefer to do so via their own contribution choices rather than through explicit monetary rewards.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nUnknown; the player is never rewarded, so their response to identifiable rewarders cannot be inferred. There is no behavioral evidence regarding whether they would reciprocate, increase cooperation, or form alliances following rewards.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThe player pays attention to the partner’s outcomes and actions, as their shifts in contribution and sanctioning track changes in the partner’s punishment behavior and contribution level. Early in the game, when they earn more than the partner while free-riding and being punished, they continue that strategy for a short time, indicating tolerance for unequal outcomes that favor them and a lack of guilt-driven adjustment. Once mutual contributions become equal and payoffs symmetric, they sustain cooperation, implying some satisfaction with equitable high-payoff states. However, they also impose punishment on a fully cooperative partner, knowingly creating inequality against the other player at cost to themselves; this looks like outcome-based retribution rather than efficiency or fairness seeking. They do not appear to try to maximize joint payoffs—they willingly destroy surplus through punishment even in efficient cooperative states. Overall, they respond to others’ outcomes primarily as a cue for whether they owe retribution or can safely express hostility, rather than as a target for egalitarian correction or welfare maximization."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a generally high contributor who anchors on full cooperation as their default. They repeatedly give the entire endowment when group contributions are moderate to high, and they often maintain this even when some peers free-ride. They does occasionally drop their contribution, but these reductions are sporadic rather than forming a clear downward trend: they sometimes contribute less than the group average and even free-ride outright on a couple of occasions, but then quickly return to full contributions. This pattern suggests a primarily cooperative type with some experimentation or mild frustration, not a deliberate long-term shift to selfishness.\n\nTheir contributions are only weakly conditional on others’ behavior. They do not systematically match the lowest or average peer contributions, and they continue to cooperate in the presence of persistent zero contributors. They appears to follow a fairness norm that “good” behavior is to contribute high amounts, but this norm is flexible enough that they sometimes permit themselves low contributions, especially when others also contribute low or when the environment seems unstable. Risk tolerance for exploitation is moderate: they accept repeated exposure to free-riders instead of systematically protecting themselves with low contributions.\n\nOverall, they behaves like a “prosocial cooperator with occasional lapses”: cooperation is their default identity, but they are not perfectly consistent and may adjust contributions opportunistically or to test the environment.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThere is no clear end-game unraveling in this player’s behavior. Near the final rounds, they mostly keep contributing at or near their earlier cooperative level, including full contributions multiple times very close to the end. Only one late deviation to a lower, but still positive, contribution occurs; this is isolated and not followed by a spiral of defection. They shows awareness of the horizon only in the sense that their pattern includes both cooperative and slightly reduced contributions, but there is no systematic decay as the final round approaches.\n\nThis suggests that they does not strongly adopt backward-induction logic that would dictate sharp contribution cuts near the end. Instead, they appears to treat cooperation as a largely stable norm over time, even when future interaction is limited. Horizon awareness is therefore present (they can see remaining rounds) but has limited practical effect on their strategy.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThe player is a willing and sometimes heavy punisher, but not in every round; punishment episodes are clustered and tied to visible free-riding or substantial under-contribution relative to high contributors. In those episodes, they spends a nontrivial amount of coins on sanctions, indicating that deterring unfairness is, at times, worth real personal cost. The use of punishment is selective: in many rounds with moderate under-contribution they refrain from punishing, but when there is a clear gap between their own high contributions and others’ much lower or zero contributions—especially when low contributors are repeated offenders—they is more likely to sanction.\n\nThe available evidence fits a “norm-enforcing” motive better than a purely retaliatory one. Their punishment is directed in contexts where others contribute clearly below the prevailing cooperative standard while the player is contributing generously. There is no sign that they punishes in response to having been punished, and no evidence of spite toward high contributors. At the same time, they does not punish systematically in every such situation, suggesting that they balances norm enforcement against cost; they appears neither hyper-aggressive nor unwilling to sanction.\n\nBecause outcome information for others is hidden, they cannot directly observe the efficiency of their sanctions. Nonetheless, their willingness to spend repeatedly on punishment implies they values expressing disapproval and attempting to shape behavior, not just maximizing their own immediate payoff.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nThe player is punished once during the game and never again. After this sanction, their subsequent behavior suggests they interprets punishment as guidance rather than provocation. They does not visibly retaliate by punishing likely punishers in later rounds, despite having several opportunities and despite continuing to use punishment in other contexts. Instead, they soon returns to fully cooperative contributions and uses punishment only against clear free-riders, not against peers who are plausibly the earlier punisher.\n\nThis pattern indicates a relatively forgiving and norm-sensitive response style: when sanctioned, they does not escalate conflict and does not appear to engage in anti-social or “revenge” punishment. They adapts in the direction of high cooperation rather than withdrawing from the group or adopting a defensive low-contribution strategy. Their reaction is consistent with an understanding that punishment can be a signal about expected norms, and they accepts that signal without personalizing it.\n\nOverall, they behaves like a prosocial cooperator who uses punishment as a targeted tool to uphold contribution norms, is resilient to being sanctioned, and is more interested in stabilizing cooperation than in settling interpersonal scores."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a generally prosocial but strategic conditional cooperator with moderate volatility. They are clearly willing to contribute fully and repeatedly when cooperation looks viable and when others’ contributions are moderate to high. They also sometimes contribute only part of their endowment and occasionally free‑ride completely, especially when they appear to test boundaries or when they can exploit a cooperative environment late in the game.\n\nTheir contributions cluster around three modes: full contribution, partial contribution, and rare zero contribution. They do not show a simple monotonic decay over time; instead, they alternate between high and medium contributions with occasional low or zero ones. This suggests they are not purely myopic or purely altruistic, but are experimenting and reacting to perceived patterns in others’ behavior.\n\nThey seem to adopt a fairness norm that expects at least moderate contributions from everyone. They often maintain or return to high contributions even after observing free‑riding by some group members, which implies they value sustaining group payoff and may believe punishment can stabilize cooperation rather than needing to personally defect whenever others do. At the same time, they are not rigidly principled: they sometimes under‑contribute when others are contributing well, indicating some willingness to take advantage of the group when it seems low‑risk.\n\nTheir risk tolerance appears moderate. They are willing to “invest” heavily in the public good many times, trusting that the multiplier makes cooperation worthwhile. But they also occasionally hedge by keeping more for themselves, especially after instability or norm violations. Overall, they behave like a pragmatic cooperator who is sensitive to norms but not self‑sacrificing at all costs.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThe player is aware of the horizon and shows some end‑game adjustment, but does not fully collapse cooperation. Near the end, they alternate between high, medium, and zero contributions rather than steadily decreasing. They do free‑ride at least once very near the end in a context where others are still contributing robustly, indicating that they understand the reduced future consequences and are willing to exploit that. However, they also continue to make non‑zero and even high contributions in the final rounds, including when there is effectively no future opportunity for reciprocity.\n\nThis mix suggests that they incorporate end‑game reasoning but are not purely backward‑inducing defectors. Their behavior is consistent with someone balancing two motives: (1) squeezing some extra payoff from late‑game free‑riding when it seems safe, and (2) maintaining a self‑image or norm of being generally cooperative, which keeps them from fully abandoning contributions as the game closes. Their cooperation decays slightly and becomes more opportunistic near the end, but does not collapse.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThe player is a willing and fairly frequent punisher. They use punishment in multiple periods and incur non‑trivial costs to do so. They deploy punishment selectively rather than randomly: punishment usage coincides with situations featuring clear free‑riders or very low contributors relative to the rest of the group. There is no evidence that they punish high contributors or norm‑compliant players, which suggests their punishment is norm‑enforcing rather than spiteful.\n\nGiven the cost/impact ratio, their punishment is not individually profitable in a narrow sense, so their use of it implies a preference for fairness and norm compliance, and/or a belief that punishment can deter future free‑riding and thus protect long‑run payoffs. They do not escalate punishment intensity over time; instead, they occasionally use modest amounts, which fits an enforcement style aimed at sending a signal rather than maximally harming defectors.\n\nThey continue to punish even after group contributions become unstable, which implies they see punishment as an ongoing enforcement tool rather than something reserved for early coordination. There is at least one instance where they punish in a low‑contribution environment, indicating that they may be trying to pull the group back toward higher norms rather than simply giving up when others defect.\n\nOverall, they match a “principled enforcer but not fanatic”: they are willing to pay to punish clear low contributors, likely see punishment as justified by fairness norms, and focus it on defectors instead of using it for random aggression or competitive sabotage. Whether they track specific identities in detail is unknown; the pattern is more consistent with punishing whoever is currently most out of line.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nThe player is punished at least once when they free‑ride. After this, they increase their contributions relative to that zero‑contribution choice, which is consistent with some degree of compliance with punishment signals. However, they do not permanently shift to full cooperation; later they still under‑contribute at times and even free‑ride again in a cooperative environment near the end. This suggests that punishment influences them but does not completely suppress their opportunism.\n\nThere is no clear evidence that they retaliate directly against any specific punisher; from the transcript we cannot see their individual punishment targets, so whether they “hit back” at whoever punished them is unknown. What is observable is that their overall pattern after being punished includes both renewed cooperation and continued use of norm‑enforcing punishment on others, rather than dropping into vendetta behavior or global defection.\n\nTheir response style fits a player who accepts punishment as somewhat legitimate: they adjust upward from the punished low‑contribution behavior but still preserve their own strategic freedom to defect when payoffs or timing look favorable. They appear more inclined to incorporate punishment as information about group norms than to treat it as a purely hostile act requiring revenge."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a steady, moderately high contributor who starts fully cooperative and then settles into a slightly-below-top, near-constant contribution level. They are willing to contribute the full endowment initially, indicating a pro-social or exploratory-cooperative stance rather than immediate free-riding. After observing that many others also contribute substantial amounts, they reduce their contribution somewhat but remain solidly cooperative, keeping their choices close to the emerging group norm rather than at the minimum or maximum.\n\nTheir pattern suggests conditional cooperation anchored around perceived fairness: they are comfortable contributing a bit less than the very highest contributors, but they consistently stay near the group’s central tendency and do not exploit high contributors. They show mild downward adjustment when the overall environment becomes noisier and some players contribute much less, yet they do not dramatically cut back or escalate to defection. This points to a preference for maintaining group efficiency and stability even when others deviate.\n\nTheir contributions are quite stable over time, with only small changes, implying a relatively low-reactivity, low-volatility strategy rather than rapid tit-for-tat. They appear to balance social preference (wanting a productive public good) with self-interest (not always matching the highest contributors), and they likely recognize the game’s strong multiplier as making cooperation individually profitable, supporting their willingness to keep contributing at a high level.\n\nOverall, they fit a “restrained conditional cooperator” type: willing to support the public good robustly, adjusting contributions slightly in response to the contribution climate, but avoiding both extreme generosity and opportunistic under-contribution.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThis player never uses the punishment option despite repeated opportunities and clear under-contribution by some others in later stages. Their consistent choice not to punish holds even when low contributors harm group efficiency and when they themselves get punished once. This pattern strongly suggests a general reluctance to spend on sanctions.\n\nTheir behavior is more consistent with a non-punishing, cost-averse stance than with oversight or inattention: they clearly engage with the contribution decision and maintain a deliberate contribution trajectory, yet they invest nothing in enforcement. They do not appear to use punishment either for retaliation (after receiving a deduction) or for norm enforcement (against obvious low contributors). This implies they either (a) doubt the effectiveness of costly punishment in this environment, (b) dislike the idea of actively harming others, or (c) prioritize maximizing their own earnings over shaping others’ behavior.\n\nThey also do not engage in “antisocial punishment”: when others contribute highly or comparably to them, they still refrain from punishing. Overall, they are a “non-punishing cooperator”: they rely on contribution choices rather than sanctions to respond to group dynamics and tolerate some amount of free-riding without direct reprisal.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThis player is observant of the environment (as evidenced by calibrated, moderate adjustments in their own contributions) but behaviorally passive with respect to others’ payoffs. They see that some players spend heavily on punishment and that certain low contributors receive substantial deductions, yet they do not join in or amplify these sanctioning patterns. Their contribution path does not show sharp reactions to seeing others punished or rewarded via higher payoffs; instead, they make small, gradual adjustments that track the general contribution climate rather than individual outcomes.\n\nWhen they personally incur a deduction, they do not escalate: they neither retaliate through punishment nor react strongly through a large change in contribution. This indicates relatively low sensitivity to personal slights and a focus on the overall game rather than on interpersonal score-settling.\n\nThey appear to interpret others’ punishment and payoff differences as background information rather than as direct signals they must respond to strategically. Their primary adaptation channel is their own contribution level, not the use of punishment. In terms of social style, they behave as a calm, norm-following participant who aims for cooperative efficiency, accepts that others will sometimes behave suboptimally or aggressively, and chooses not to invest effort or resources into reshaping others’ outcomes."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a generally cooperative, conditional contributor who anchors around the emerging group norm but is willing to deviate when treated unfairly. Early on, they contribute below the group’s typical level, then adjust upward and eventually match or slightly exceed the apparent cooperative standard. They show a clear tendency to raise their own contribution when they see that most others are contributing generously, suggesting a preference for mutual high cooperation rather than exploitation. At the same time, they react sharply when they are punished despite cooperating: after being a high contributor and then receiving a deduction, they temporarily drop their contribution to a very low level, despite the group still contributing relatively well. This indicates conditional cooperation combined with negative reciprocity—willingness to withhold contributions when feeling unfairly targeted. They later return to full contribution, which suggests they are not committed free riders but rather “responsive cooperators” who want high contributions to be met with respect and fairness. Their pattern is consistent with someone who values efficiency and fairness, is moderately risk-tolerant (willing to contribute more when the environment looks cooperative), but is sensitive to norm violations directed at them (especially unjustified punishment).\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThe player uses punishment regularly but sparingly, at a low intensity and with consistent direction. They never spend heavily; instead, they use single, small punishment units in several rounds. Their targeting is strongly aligned with contribution deviations: they appear to focus on those who contribute conspicuously less than the group (such as very low or minimal contributors), and they do not systematically punish high contributors or apparent cooperators. This points to a norm-enforcing, deterrence-oriented motive rather than spite or blind retaliation. There is no clear evidence that they directly retaliate against those who punish them, because punishers are anonymous and there is no systematic shift toward punishing likely aggressors; instead, their punishment pattern is stable and contribution-based. Their own short episode of being punished without punishing back, followed by continued low-level norm enforcement of low contributors, suggests they separate “how I am treated” from “what maintains group norms,” at least in their punishment decisions. Overall, they behave like a mild, principled enforcer: willing to pay to discipline under-contributors, but not trying to maximize harm, and not escalating.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThe player pays close attention to others’ contributions and resultant payoffs and adjusts their own behavior in response, particularly their contributions. When they see the group contributing high amounts and earning strong payoffs, they strengthen their own cooperative stance over time, moving toward full contribution. This reveals a belief that others are, or can be, reliably cooperative, and that matching them is worthwhile. However, they are sensitive to how they themselves are treated: when they receive punishment despite having contributed at or above the cooperative standard, they respond by sharply reducing their next contribution, even though group contributions remain relatively generous. This indicates negative reciprocity and a concern for procedural fairness; being punished unjustly appears to reduce their willingness to cooperate, at least temporarily. Notably, they do not respond by ramping up punishment, which suggests they channel their reaction primarily through contribution behavior rather than counter-punishment. When low contributors are heavily punished by others, the player’s own behavior is consistent with approval of that norm-enforcement: they either also punish such low contributors or continue to contribute fully in later periods when low contributors are being disciplined, implying they see strong punishment of clear free riders as legitimate and helpful for sustaining cooperation. Overall, they come across as a conditional cooperator and mild norm enforcer who rewards fair, high-cooperation environments with high contributions, but withdraws cooperation when they feel unfairly targeted."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a moderately cooperative, efficiency-aware conditional contributor with some opportunistic streaks. Contributions cluster around the group average or slightly below it, with occasional full contributions when group cooperation looks strong. The player clearly understands that contributing is socially beneficial, given that they never free-ride aggressively and sometimes give the maximum possible amount. However, they also show willingness to under-contribute relative to high contributors when overall cooperation appears secure, which suggests a concern for personal payoff and a readiness to “coattail” on others’ generosity.\n\nTheir contribution pattern is responsive to the group rather than fixed. When others’ cooperation is high and stable, they are willing to match or exceed the typical contribution. When some group members start contributing very little and total contributions fall, they do not escalate their own giving to compensate; instead, they stay around a moderate level that protects their payoff while still participating in the public good. This indicates conditional cooperation based on observed peer behavior rather than unconditional altruism.\n\nFairness norms appear present but not strict. The player does not insist on exact equality in contributions, tolerating moderate deviations as long as the overall cooperation level remains high. They seem more bothered by very low contributors than by small under-contributions. Risk tolerance is medium: they are willing to risk higher contributions when others appear cooperative, but they do not keep pushing contributions upward when the environment grows more erratic.\n\nOverall, their type is a “pragmatic conditional cooperator”: they value the public good and prefer high-contribution equilibria, but they also guard against being exploited and are comfortable contributing somewhat less than the most generous group members when that seems safe.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThis player is an active, norm-enforcing punisher who primarily targets conspicuously low contributors and appears focused on shaping group behavior rather than retaliating for personal harm. They do not punish every round, and when they do, they spend a meaningful but not extreme amount on punishment. This indicates they are willing to incur real costs to enforce norms, but they are not obsessed with punishment nor are they punishing indiscriminately.\n\nTheir punishment choices are selective: they direct punishment toward players whose contributions are far below the informal group standard, especially when those low contributions stand out amidst generally high cooperation. They do not appear to punish those who are roughly at or above the group mean, even if those players are slightly below the maximum, suggesting they are enforcing a “no blatant free-riding” rule rather than a “everyone must give the maximum” rule.\n\nThe timing of their punishment aligns more with deterrence than with revenge. They are not personally targeted by punishment in a way that would justify strong retaliatory motives, yet they still choose to punish low contributors on some occasions. This behavior is consistent with a desire to correct or deter free-riding for the sake of the group outcome. They also show that punishment decisions can change over time: they sometimes refrain from punishing despite the presence of low contributors, which suggests they may be balancing the marginal benefit of further norm enforcement against the cost to themselves, or inferring that others are already punishing the same targets.\n\nThey do not use punishment to discipline high contributors or to respond spitefully to others’ payoffs; there is no evidence of antisocial punishment. Their pattern fits a “prosocial, efficiency-minded norm enforcer” who uses punishment strategically against clear deviants, not as an expression of hostility or competition.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThis player tracks others’ contributions and the aggregate payoff environment closely and uses that information to adjust both contributions and punishment. When the group’s overall payoff is high and cooperation is strong, they are willing to maintain or even increase their own contribution and sometimes abstain from punishment, effectively free-riding partially on the social order while still supporting it. When they see individuals benefiting from the group while contributing very little, and especially when those individuals still end up with solid payoffs, they become more willing to spend to reduce those players’ earnings.\n\nThey seem more sensitive to contribution behavior than to final payoff levels per se. High earners are not punished if their contributions are also high; low contributors are targeted even if their payoffs are not the very highest. This suggests that what matters to them is whether others have “earned” their payoffs by contributing adequately, not the absolute size of those payoffs.\n\nThe player appears to infer and rely on emergent norms. When many others also spend on punishment and low contributors suffer large total deductions, the player sometimes holds back from adding their own punishment, implying they expect group-level enforcement to suffice. Conversely, when low-contribution behavior looks under-sanctioned relative to its deviation from the norm, they step in and contribute to punishment. This indicates a belief that punishment is a shared responsibility rather than solely theirs.\n\nIn terms of learning, the player adapts gradually: they adjust contributions up or down in response to observed group cooperation and punishment patterns, but they do not show abrupt swings or extreme reactions. As the environment becomes more heterogeneous, with some players contributing very low amounts and others remaining high, they neither collapse into full free-riding nor escalate into constant punishment. This stability suggests a temperament that is measured and pragmatic, valuing cooperation and fairness while continuously weighing personal cost against group-level benefits."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a consistently high contributor with mild responsiveness to the group. They start by giving substantially more than the minimal cooperative norm and then move quickly to full contributions. Across the game they keep their contributions at or near the maximum, with only small downward adjustments. Their giving is not purely mechanical: when group contributions dip, they modestly reduce their own, and when low contributions come from clear outliers, they still remain above the group average. This suggests a conditional cooperator with a strong internal norm to support the public good rather than a strict “mirror” of others’ behavior.\n\nThey do not appear highly risk‑averse about being exploited; they continue to contribute generously even after receiving unexplained punishment and in the presence of repeat low contributors. Efficiency matters to them: the environment has a high marginal per capita return, and their behavior matches someone who recognizes that mutual high contributions are collectively and individually beneficial. They also accept minor personal disadvantage to uphold this cooperative pattern, rather than optimizing narrowly for short‑term payoff. Overall, they fit a “pro‑social conditional cooperator” type with a strong fairness/efficiency norm and moderate tolerance for free‑riding before adjusting downward.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThis player is willing to use costly punishment selectively and in a principled way. They do not punish every round, and they never appear to punish high or average contributors. Their punishment is concentrated on clear low contributors and is applied at a non‑trivial intensity when they act, indicating they care about enforcement rather than symbolic gestures.\n\nTheir pattern fits a norm‑enforcing role: they punish those who contribute far below the informal group standard, particularly when such behavior threatens the cooperative equilibrium. They do not show clear signs of retaliation toward those who might have punished them earlier; punished targets are better explained by low contributions than by any clear link to their own prior deductions. They also refrain from punishing borderline cases, indicating some threshold before they act rather than punishing any deviation. This suggests a “strong conditional cooperator with altruistic punishment”: willing to spend to discipline free‑riders but not inclined to use punishment vindictively or indiscriminately. They appear motivated more by deterrence and fairness maintenance than by short‑term payoff maximization.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThis player observes others’ contributions and net payoffs and updates their behavior in a measured way. When the group largely maintains high contributions and punishment keeps defectors in check, they continue to contribute fully and abstain from further punishment, suggesting satisfaction with the emergent norm. When conspicuous low contributors appear and sanctions against them are either absent or appear insufficient, the player both slightly reduces their own contribution and steps in with targeted punishment, indicating sensitivity to both actions and outcomes.\n\nThey do not escalate or withdraw cooperation in response to personally receiving punishment; their giving remains high and their use of punishment continues to target low contributors rather than suspected punishers. This implies they interpret outcomes primarily through a cooperative‑norm lens rather than through a personal grievance lens. They tolerate some inequality in payoffs when it arises from differences in contribution and sanctioning, but respond when inequality is driven by sustained low contributions benefiting from the group. Overall, they read the outcome structure for signals about the health of cooperation and adjust in ways intended to stabilize a high‑contribution, norm‑compliant environment."

They regularly give well above the group’s average and are comfortable matching or exceeding the modal cooperation level when others are cooperative. They appear to value maintaining a strong public good and are willing to sacrifice private payoff to do so.\n\nTheir contributions are adaptive rather than fixed. When most others contribute high amounts, they push their own contribution higher, sometimes up to the full endowment, indicating a strong conditional-cooperation tendency: they are more generous when they perceive the group as cooperative and stable. When there is a noticeable emergence of very low contributors, they reduce their own contribution substantially, signaling that they expect at least a minimal norm of participation and are not willing to indefinitely subsidize clear free riders.\n\nThey show some sensitivity to fairness: they do not insist on perfect equality, but they react behaviorally when others’ contributions fall far below the group cluster. This reaction includes both downward adjustment of their own giving and increased punitive activity, suggesting they link fairness norms to both contribution and sanctions. Their willingness to swing their contribution both upward and downward suggests moderate risk tolerance: they are prepared to risk being more generous than necessary when the group looks trustworthy, but they will also risk triggering conflict by cutting back when norms are violated.\n\nOverall, the player fits a “conditional altruist with enforcement”: they like high cooperation, readily invest in it, but make their cooperation contingent on others meeting a baseline standard and on having tools to discipline severe free riding.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThis player is a consistent, low-intensity punisher who targets clear under-contributors and apparent free riders. They are willing to spend on punishment in most rounds, but typically in small, single-unit amounts. This pattern indicates that they see punishment as a tool to enforce norms rather than as a way to maximize immediate material payoff, since the punishment technology is costly and they still choose to bear that cost.\n\nTheir targets are systematically those contributing conspicuously less than the bulk of the group, particularly very low or minimal contributors. When someone’s effort to the public good is far below what the player and most others are doing, the player reliably participates in sanctioning. The player does not appear to punish high or typical contributors, suggesting they are not using punishment opportunistically or for spite; instead, they are discriminating and norm-oriented.\n\nThey are willing to punish even when their own contribution is high and the group outcome is strong, which indicates an enforcement motive rather than pure frustration or retaliation over personal loss. At the same time, when low contributing behavior becomes more widespread or extreme, the player reduces their own contribution and sometimes withholds punishment, hinting at a limit to how much they will invest in “policing” if they feel it will not be effective or reciprocated by others.\n\nTheir use of relatively small punishment units suggests a preference for calibrated, signaling sanctions rather than maximal harm. They seem to aim for deterrence and norm communication—reminding deviators of the expected standard—rather than trying to drive them out or impose disproportionate suffering. There is no evidence of retaliatory punishment in response to being personally punished; after being sanctioned themselves once, they do not launch a visibly harsher or broader punishment campaign. This implies they either do not infer who punished them or deliberately avoid vendettas, staying focused on contribution behavior rather than on payoff shocks.\n\nIn summary, this player acts as a mild, principled enforcer: ready to pay to punish clear free riders, careful not to punish cooperators, and using punishment as a corrective signal more than as revenge.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThis player pays close attention to the pattern of others’ contributions and the resulting payoffs, and they adjust both contribution and punishment accordingly. When they observe a cluster of high contributions leading to high payoffs for almost everyone, they are comfortable sustaining or increasing their own cooperation, even while spending coins on sanctioning a few deviants. The fact that they continue to punish while group welfare is high suggests they prioritize maintaining norms over squeezing out maximum immediate profit.\n\nWhen others’ outcomes reflect extreme free riding—visible in low contributions that nonetheless share in the redistributed pool—they respond by combining two moves: they reduce their own contributions, and they either initiate or maintain targeted punishment toward those low contributors. This shows that they interpret others’ good payoffs (achieved via low contributions) as an unfair gain that justifies costly correction. They do not, however, lash out against everyone; they distinguish between typical contributors whose payoffs are high but norm-consistent, and outliers whose payoffs seem unearned.\n\nAfter receiving punishment themselves once, they do not obviously change strategy in a way that reflects fear of being punished for high or low contributions; instead, their main behavioral inflections track the structure of others’ contributions and apparent norm violations. This suggests they care more about contribution patterns and fairness than about their own short-run payoff volatility.\n\nThey appear to infer that most other players are broadly cooperative but that a subset is willing to free ride if unpunished. Their behavioral response is to support the cooperative majority by staying generous and, at the same time, to participate in disciplining the minority through modest, repeated sanctions. If they see that others are also punishing egregious under-contributors—reflected in heavy deductions to those players—they continue to invest in the norm, likely believing that the enforcement environment is shared rather than solitary.\n\nOverall, the player treats others’ outcomes as signals about the health of the cooperation norm. High, fairly earned payoffs lead them to remain cooperative and gently enforcing; visible gains from free riding trigger lower contributions and focused punishment."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a highly inconsistent contributor who treats contribution choices as a way to express moral positions and opposition to group behavior, not as a way to maximize payoff. They sometimes match the group’s full-contribution norm, but they also repeatedly free-ride even when that predictably triggers extreme punishment and huge losses. Their switches between contributing and not contributing align with social and moral stances: they contribute fully when they feel aligned with a cooperative, non-bullying norm, and withhold when they are resisting or protesting the group’s behavior. They do not appear risk-averse; they are willing to incur very large, predictable losses rather than conform to norms they see as unethical. They do not prioritize efficiency or aggregate earnings; instead they prioritize maintaining their own notion of integrity, even when that sharply reduces payoffs for themselves and, at times, for others. Fairness for them is defined less by payoff patterns and more by whether people are treated respectfully.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nTheir tone is moralizing but not overtly abusive; they criticize others’ behavior as “bullying” and “disgusting,” but avoid name-calling beyond reactive barbs when provoked. They explicitly frame their actions as guided by “morals,” and indicate they would rather personally lose money than be complicit in behavior they see as cruel. They are willing to stand against a clear majority and remain engaged in dialogue even while being mocked and punished. They confront the dominant coalition repeatedly, arguing that targeting and mocking a single low contributor is wrong, and later that the sustained harassment is unacceptable. Their communication is reactive and principled rather than strategic: they are not trying to coordinate a sub-group or redirect incentives, they are staking out a position of moral refusal. They continue to respond for several rounds under heavy social pressure, then go quiet later, suggesting emotional fatigue or a decision that further argument is pointless. Overall, they are socially engaged, values-driven, and prepared to be socially isolated to maintain their stance.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nAwareness of the finite horizon does not lead them to a payoff-maximizing end-game strategy. Instead of converging to a stable high-contribution pattern to salvage earnings, they maintain a low-contribution stance across late rounds even as punishment remains intense, indicating that their primary goal is not final payoff. They do not appear to adjust behavior in the final rounds to avoid last-minute punishment, nor do they escalate retaliation (they never punish at all). Their late-game choices remain consistent with an ongoing moral protest rather than with backward induction or standard end-game defection/cooperation logic. There is no evidence that the approaching last round changes their priorities; they stay in character rather than “cashing out” rationally.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey never spend any coins on punishment despite repeatedly suffering extremely heavy deductions and being insulted by several others. This strongly suggests they reject the use of punitive tools in this environment on principle. Their chat contributions reinforce this: they criticize others specifically for using punishment and ridicule against a single low contributor and then against themselves. They are not interested in deterrence, reciprocity, or retaliation, even when it would be emotionally understandable. Instead, they absorb large losses while continuing to argue against what they see as bullying. They do not selectively punish even clear norm violators; rather than enforce norms, they question the legitimacy of the prevailing norm itself. Their stance is thus “anti-punishment” and anti-bullying: they view the punishment system, as used by others, as morally corrupting, and decline to participate in it even at a significant personal cost."

At several points, when everyone else contributes, they still defect, revealing a readiness to free-ride when they think the group is stable enough that their own deviation will not threaten the public good.\n\nThey show no gradual decline in contribution over time; rather, their pattern is episodic: stretches of full cooperation, punctuated by a few self-serving zero-contribution choices even when others cooperate. They do not visibly condition their contribution on specific individuals’ behavior, except for mild attention to one group member who sometimes withholds contributions; however, they do not actually retaliate against that member via their own contributions and instead keep contributing when that member defects. This suggests they value maintaining the high-contribution equilibrium more than “punishing” defectors by also defecting.\n\nThey appear moderately risk-tolerant regarding earnings: they are willing to risk being viewed as a free-rider for extra payoff, but not so frequently that they destabilize the group or stand out as systematically non-cooperative. Fairness norms are weakly internalized: they endorse the rhetoric that everyone should contribute, and they often act accordingly, yet they break that norm when it is privately beneficial and unlikely to be directly traceable or punished.

Their tone is neutral-to-positive: they affirm cooperative narratives and occasionally offer a directive or observation, but they do not joke, self-disclose, or build rapport beyond what helps the game.\n\nThey explicitly endorse full contribution and publicly call for everyone to contribute, including a direct instruction that everyone should put all their endowment into the pot. This communicative stance promotes cooperation, but it is partially performative, as it is not consistently matched by their own contributions. They show no visible remorse or self-justification when they free-ride; they simply remain silent about those inconsistencies.\n\nThey pay attention to group structure and timing, asking about the number of rounds and giving a speculative (and incorrect) guess. This shows concern with planning and horizon, likely because it matters for whether to continue cooperating or to start exploiting. They also directly point out when another specific player is not contributing, making their non-cooperation salient to the group, which can serve as soft social pressure without direct hostility.\n\nThey respond to others’ coordination attempts (e.g., reaffirming generic pro-cooperation comments) but do not initiate detailed strategy discussion. Overall, they adopt a low-effort, coordination-supportive communication style: enough engagement to be part of the cooperative norm, but no sustained leadership, emotional investment, or repair work.\n\n<REWARD>\nThe player uses rewards sparingly and selectively. For most rounds, they choose not to spend anything on rewarding others, even when group cooperation is high and many others are giving out rewards. This suggests that they see rewarding as personally costly and not essential for maintaining cooperation, or they rely on others to shoulder the cost of reinforcing norms.\n\nWhen they do spend on rewards, they incur a moderate total cost in a single episode rather than distributing it evenly over time. This clustered spending aligns with a “one-off reinforcement or reciprocity” style rather than ongoing norm enforcement. Because reward identities are anonymous, it is unknown exactly which peers they support, but the timing of their reward usage coincides with high cooperation levels and cases where some players previously deviated but then rejoined cooperative behavior. This pattern is consistent (with low-to-moderate confidence) with rewarding those who contribute or who have recently returned to cooperation.\n\nThey never use rewards as a direct counter to defectors (e.g., by rewarding everyone else except the defector) in any clear, repeated way; they also never escalate into “competitive rewarding” or status-seeking via large reward outlays. Their reward behavior is low frequency, moderate intensity, and appears aimed at occasional reinforcement of prosocial behavior rather than systematic incentive design.\n\nThey do not appear to treat rewards as expressive gratitude (they often receive rewards but almost never reciprocate immediately), suggesting a more instrumental than emotional relation to the mechanism. In sum, they are a mostly non-rewarding player who occasionally uses rewards to buttress cooperation when it feels salient or threatened.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThe player monitors others’ contributions and payoffs and occasionally comments on deviations but does not fundamentally change their own long-run cooperative stance as a direct reaction to individuals’ earnings or reward usage.\n\nThey notice and publicly call out a specific group member’s non-contribution behavior, highlighting that this member is benefiting more while not putting in. Yet, despite recognizing this free-riding, they largely continue to contribute fully in subsequent rounds when that member defects, implying that the player tolerates some inequity when the group outcome remains strong. This indicates a willingness to prioritize group efficiency over strict equality, at least in the short to medium term.\n\nThey also pay attention to how long the game is lasting and how much effort others are expending (including notable high reward spending by some peers), but they do not explicitly respond to those high-cost generosity signals. Their own contribution and reward decisions do not visibly escalate in response to others’ large reward expenditures; they accept being a net beneficiary of others’ generosity without compensating behavior. This suggests limited reciprocity toward costly prosocial acts directed at the group, and a comfort with asymmetric benefit if it does not provoke social sanction.\n\nReceiving rewards does not appear to significantly alter their strategy: when they are rewarded after cooperating, they continue cooperating; when they are not rewarded after cooperating, they also continue cooperating in many cases. When they free-ride and are not punished or singled out, their willingness to occasionally defect persists. Thus their behavior is only weakly contingent on immediate payoff differentials; they seem more guided by a loose plan (cooperate most of the time, defect opportunistically) than by fine-grained reactions to each round’s outcome.\n\nOverall, they are observant and mildly responsive in speech to others’ outcomes but relatively stable in their own mixed strategy, allowing them to benefit from both the cooperative norm and occasional self-serving deviations."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a calculated, opportunistic free-rider who occasionally cooperates but does not commit to any stable norm. They alternate between full contribution and full defection in a way that suggests active experimentation with payoff structures rather than moral or fairness-driven behavior. They begin by cooperating when the group appears coordinated and optimistic, but quickly show that they are willing to defect even when others are mostly or fully cooperating, capturing large private gains while still benefiting from others’ contributions. Their pattern indicates low intrinsic concern for fairness; they are comfortable taking more than their “share” when the environment allows it. They appear to understand the payoff consequences well enough to exploit high group contributions rather than treating the game naively. Their risk tolerance is moderate: they defect in socially risky moments (when cooperation is fragile), but never push that into explicit confrontation or explanation in chat. Overall, they behave as a payoff-maximizer who is willing to cooperate when convenient but defaults to self-interest once they see that others’ cooperation can be exploited.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThey are minimally communicative and socially reactive rather than proactive. They speak only a couple of times, and their contributions to chat are brief and somewhat ambiguous in tone. One remark expresses surprise at another player’s heavy use of rewards, which reads as a mixture of mild judgment or bemusement and curiosity rather than moral outrage or support. They do not make direct attempts to organize group behavior, nor do they explain or justify their own contribution choices. When others question their behavior indirectly, they do not respond. This suggests a low-engagement, low-justification style: they are aware of the social environment but do not invest effort in persuasion or reputation management. They are also not openly hostile or trolling; instead, they occupy a quiet, somewhat aloof role, letting others argue about norms and strategy while they adjust their own choices in the background.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThey show clear awareness of the finite horizon: the number of rounds is visible and referenced by others, and they are exposed to explicit “last round” talk. Their behavior late in the game, however, does not show a shift toward “cooperate for the finale”; instead, they continue to free-ride even when some others still contribute. There is no observable attempt to use the final rounds either to punish defectors (via withholding cooperation) in a principled way or to reward cooperators through their own contributions. Their end-game pattern is consistent with forward-looking self-interest rather than reciprocity or reputation building: once they recognize that coordination is unstable and others are debating whether to stop contributing, they maintain or increase their own defection. They do not comment on the approaching end directly, suggesting that horizon awareness affects their strategy but not their explicit communication.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey never spend any coins on rewards in any observed round, despite having multiple opportunities and seeing others experiment with rewarding. This strongly indicates that they either see no instrumental value in rewarding (given the technology and group behavior) or that they are unwilling to sacrifice private payoff for normative or expressive reasons. Their behavior is consistent with a simple rule: keep all reward resources for themselves, regardless of whether others contribute or reward. There is no sign that they use rewards as strategic reinforcement, as a signal of approval, or as a way to build alliances. They also do not even use small, low-cost “tokens” of reward, which suggests a robust reluctance to incur any cost for others’ benefit, at least within this incentive structure. Whether they conceptually understand reward dynamics is unknown; what is clear is that, behaviorally, they act as a strict non-rewarder.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThey receive a small, unsolicited reward early in the game, but they do not acknowledge it explicitly in chat, do not reciprocate to that specific player, and do not begin using the reward mechanism themselves afterward. This is strong evidence that they are not guided by reciprocity norms in this environment. Being rewarded does not trigger gratitude signaling, alliance formation, or even a minimal return reward. Their silence toward the rewarder also suggests low social investment: they neither thank nor criticize the rewarder, and they do not attempt to coordinate future cooperation with them. Their one notable chat remark about rewards expresses surprise at a different player’s large reward expenditure, not gratitude toward their own rewarder. Overall, they treat rewards as windfall gains rather than as part of a reciprocal relationship.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey observe others’ contributions and the use of rewards, and their limited comments focus on surprising or extreme behavior rather than moralizing about fairness. When a player spends a large amount on rewarding, they respond with brief amazement, which likely indicates that they see this as strategically or economically unusual. They do not verbally criticize defectors or praise cooperators, even when others vocally do so. Likewise, they do not join in when others complain about “greed” or “not understanding math.” Instead, they adapt their own behavior—moving toward more defection as the group becomes more fractured—without publicly aligning with either side of the emerging norm conflict. This pattern suggests that they monitor the social and outcome environment mainly to adjust their own payoff strategy, not to enforce norms or seek group harmony. They remain largely detached from others’ fortunes, neither openly gloating nor empathizing, and they do not use outcome information to build any visible coalition."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a mixed, somewhat erratic conditional cooperator with occasional free-riding. They are clearly willing to fully cooperate: they repeatedly choose the maximal contribution and continue to do so even after witnessing at least one clear defector gain higher payoffs. At the same time, they also fully defect in some rounds, including when many others defect and when free-riding is especially profitable. Their pattern suggests they are sensitive to group norms and possibly experimenting rather than strictly following a single rule.\n\nThey appear comfortable with risk in the sense of not always aligning with the majority: they fully contribute in situations where many peers call for defection, but also defect in situations with both cooperative and uncooperative behavior around them. There is no evidence that they follow a strict fairness norm such as “match the group average” or “never exploit cooperators”; instead they alternate between being a full cooperator and a free-rider.\n\nOverall, they seem responsive to the broad cooperation climate, but not in a strictly monotone way: they sometimes cooperate when others say not to, and sometimes defect when substantial cooperation is present. Their decisions fit a type that weighs both profit and the social environment but does not lock into a stable rule.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nTheir communication is sparse, reactive, and focused on clarification rather than leadership. They greet others, but they do not initiate strategy proposals about contribution or reward. When another player appears to accuse “monkey” of not contributing, they quickly defend their reputation, clarifying that they did contribute everything. This shows concern about how others perceive their contribution, and a desire not to be misclassified as a defector.\n\nBeyond this, they ask for clarification when they are confused about being addressed, indicating they pay attention to chat and care about understanding social references. They do not engage in moralizing, blaming, or directing others’ strategies, and they never join the more heated or sarcastic exchanges. Their tone is neutral to slightly defensive when their behavior is questioned, but not aggressive. They seem socially attentive yet reserved, preferring to correct misunderstandings rather than steer group norms.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThey clearly have awareness of the game horizon (the number of rounds) from the shared information and chat context, but there is no direct statement from them about the remaining rounds. Behaviorally, they do not follow a simple end-game defection logic. Even when others explicitly push for universal defection at the very end, they still fully contribute in the last round. This suggests that, at least in this setting, they do not adopt a purely backward-induction or “last-round, always defect” strategy.\n\nInstead, they seem willing to maintain or attempt cooperation even in an environment where many explicitly discuss shutting cooperation down at the end. At the same time, they defect in earlier late-stage play, so it is not that they are consistently principled; their last-round full contribution indicates either a residual cooperative inclination, confusion, or a deliberate choice to keep contributing despite the end-game incentives. Their end-game pattern is thus mixed but notably not purely self-serving.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey never spend any coins on rewarding others in any round, despite having multiple opportunities and clear examples of others using the reward mechanism. This holds even when they personally receive a small amount of reward early on. Their revealed preference is that reward is not worth the cost under these parameters, or at least not worth using given how others behave.\n\nThey also never publicly endorse or discuss reward in chat. There is no sign they use reward strategically to encourage cooperation, reciprocate kindness, or punish defectors indirectly by rewarding only cooperators. In terms of type, they act as a non-rewarder: they rely solely on contribution choices rather than secondary mechanisms to influence others.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThey receive a small reward early in the game from another player. After this, there is no observable change in their reward behavior or contributions that clearly reflects gratitude-based reciprocity. They do not start rewarding the rewarder (or anyone) afterward, and they do not comment on the reward in chat. There is no explicit attempt to build an alliance or exchange of favors with the identifiable rewarder.\n\nTheir subsequent contribution pattern (alternating between full contribution and defection) does not obviously track whether they have been rewarded or who rewarded them. This suggests that, at least in this context, they do not strongly condition on having been rewarded, either in terms of reciprocity or increased commitment to cooperation. Their response to reward is best characterized as neutral: they accept the payoff but do not change their strategic toolkit or communication because of it.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey observe all outcome information, including who contributes, who defects, and who spends on reward, but they rarely comment on it. The only clear reaction to outcome-related social information is when they are implicitly accused of not contributing; then they assert that they did contribute fully. This indicates they care about their cooperative image relative to others’ outcomes and do not want to be grouped with defectors.\n\nThey do not publicly criticize or praise players who defect or over-reward, nor do they join in group condemnation of perceived free-riders. They also do not publicly engage with others’ questions about the value of reward. Their behavior suggests a player who monitors the environment, adjusts contributions in a way that loosely tracks the group’s cooperation level, but does so quietly and without overt commentary on others’ payoffs or strategic choices. They appear more concerned with their own payoff and reputation than with norm enforcement or moral judgment of others."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a calculating, intermittently cooperative free-rider. They switch repeatedly between full contribution and zero, rather than settling into a stable pattern. They start by advocating universal high contribution but do not personally adhere to an unconditional “always contribute” norm. Instead, they appear to adopt an opportunistic strategy: they sometimes contribute fully when the rest of the group is cooperating, but they also frequently free-ride on others’ full contributions, especially once a cooperative pattern is established.\n\nTheir contribution behavior is not tightly conditional on any single partner’s past behavior; they alternate between contributing and not contributing even when others’ behavior is stable and cooperative. They show no clear attempts to directly enforce fairness via their own contributions (for example, by matching a specific partner’s level or punishing defectors through reduced contributions); instead, they prioritize maximizing their own payoff while still sometimes supporting the public good. Overall, they exhibit relatively low sacrifice tolerance and moderate risk-taking: they are willing to free-ride even though the group is watching and has access to reward mechanisms, suggesting that social disapproval or loss of reward is not a strong deterrent for them.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nTheir communication is brief, directive, and somewhat accusatory, rather than affiliative or relationship-building. They initiate coordination attempts early, advocating for universal maximum contributions and directly calling out specific players by name when they suspect them of not following the cooperative plan or “pulling something.” This shows a preference for explicit norm setting and monitoring, but without corresponding self-consistency.\n\nThey do not engage much in back-and-forth dialogue and do not respond to others’ confusions or questions with explanations or reassurance. Their style is more about issuing instructions or warnings than about building consensus. They also do not comment on reward patterns explicitly, even when they are personally rewarded. Their engagement is intermittent: they speak up at key moments (to push for cooperation or call someone out) but otherwise remain quiet.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThey exhibit a noticeable end-game shift toward increased free-riding. As the remaining number of rounds declines, they contribute zero more frequently, even when others remain cooperative. This suggests that they are sensitive to the finite horizon and reduce their willingness to cooperate as the game approaches its conclusion. They do not try to sustain the earlier stated “everyone always contribute” norm into the last block of rounds; instead they exploit the group’s continued cooperation to secure high private payoffs. There is no evidence that they try to orchestrate an explicit end-game defection strategy via chat; the shift is behavioral, not communicative.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey never spend any coins on rewarding others. This is consistent and unconditional across the interaction, despite multiple opportunities and despite being embedded in a group where others use the reward mechanism extensively. They therefore behave as a pure non-rewarder: they exploit the externality of others’ rewards (both as a beneficiary and as a cooperator who gains from stabilized cooperation) without contributing to the cost of maintaining that system.\n\nThe absence of any reward spending suggests they either (a) place a very high value on their own payoff relative to prosocial signaling, or (b) view reward in this implementation as strategically inefficient and thus not worth using, even as a tool to encourage cooperation. There is no evidence that they reward as a gesture of gratitude, reciprocity, or coalition building.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThey receive rewards multiple times from various partners, including in situations where they are fully cooperative and in situations where they are not especially distinctive in behavior. Despite this, they do not reciprocate with rewards to those who reward them, nor do they show any visible behavioral shift (e.g., sustained higher contributions) that clearly tracks being rewarded.\n\nThey also do not verbally acknowledge reward-givers. Their only direct messages to specific players are admonitions or calls to cooperate, not thanks or alliance bids. This suggests low reciprocity in the reward dimension and an apparent willingness to accept rewards as “free benefits” without feeling obliged to respond. Any sense of gratitude, if present, does not manifest in observable strategic responses.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey see that other players spend substantially on rewards, often reducing their own payoffs to support cooperators, yet they do not mirror that behavior. They behave as a beneficiary of others’ pro-sociality rather than a contributor to it. They do not directly comment on others’ spending patterns or on the fairness of payoffs, focusing instead on whether others are contributing the “max.”\n\nWhen they call out individual players, it is in response to suspected or actual deviations from high contribution, not to their reward decisions. They do not praise high contributors or heavy rewarders, nor do they express sympathy when others’ payoffs are reduced by their spending. Their main observable concern is whether others’ actions threaten or support the group contribution level that they would like to exploit or occasionally support. Overall, they attend to contribution behavior more than to payoff inequalities arising from the reward mechanism, and they do not show norm-enforcement via rewards, only via verbal nudging and their own opportunistic contribution choices."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is primarily a deliberate free‑rider who occasionally switches to over‑contribution, seemingly for amusement or to respond to social pressure rather than to maximize earnings. Early on, they consistently keep their entire endowment while the group coordinates on full contributions, even after the norm is clearly established and explained, which indicates conscious exploitation of the public good rather than confusion. They openly acknowledge not donating and do not show guilt; instead they lean into the role and sometimes try to recruit others to stop contributing. At several points they abruptly move to partial or full contributions, including some rounds where they contribute more than the group’s modal level. These spikes do not follow a clear payoff logic; they appear tied to boredom, mock-cooperation, or momentary engagement with the group rather than a consistent conditional cooperation rule. They show no stable fairness norm: they are comfortable benefiting from others’ generosity without matching it, and when they do contribute substantially it is not sustained. Their risk tolerance with respect to payoff volatility is high: they are willing to sacrifice large amounts of their own payoff (even going very negative in some rounds due to rewards) for idiosyncratic reasons, implying low concern for monetary optimization and high willingness to “play with” the mechanism.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nTheir tone is irreverent, sarcastic, and often openly contemptuous of the task. They treat the game as trivial “pennies” and repeatedly state they just want it over, which signals low intrinsic engagement with the economic objective and a focus on time or amusement instead. They engage actively in chat rather than withdrawing: they banter, joke about being a “monkey,” tease others, and occasionally make meta‑comments about survey platforms or codes. They are responsive to others’ messages, answering questions and reacting to accusations, but use this mostly to maintain a persona of playful defiance rather than to build cooperation. They explicitly push against the group’s cooperative norm at times, encouraging others not to donate and to rush through, even after the payoff structure is clear. When attacked or mocked (being called a freeloader, mole, etc.), they double down on the behavior rather than appeasing the group, suggesting thick skin and a contrarian streak. They show some curiosity and awareness about the mechanics (asking how long the game goes, asking about redistribution), but they also explicitly state that they do not bother to read instructions, signaling low conscientiousness in this context. Overall, they are socially engaged but norm‑resistant, using humor and provocation rather than persuasion toward collective efficiency.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey eventually use the reward mechanism extremely heavily and in an economically irrational way, sacrificing large amounts of coins to send small rewards. Early on, they claim (in chat) to have given a lot to a specific player, though the recorded data show no reward spending at that moment; this could reflect confusion about timing, misremembering, or intentional trolling. Later, they actually spend very large sums rewarding others, sometimes enough to drive their own payoff deeply negative. The pattern of recipients is unknown from the transcript, but the scale and timing suggest the rewards are not narrowly targeted strategic reinforcements; instead they seem driven by whimsy, performative generosity, or experimentation with the interface. Their willingness to “give all my coins” and then follow through with huge expenditures shows that once they decide to reward, they do so extravagantly. This is not conditional on being treated well themselves: they reward in rounds where they have consistently free‑ridden and have not been notably rewarded by others. There is no clear evidence they are trying to incentivize higher contributions by others; their rewards do not correlate with a subsequent stable move to mutual high contributions. Overall, they treat reward as a toy or as a way to dramatize their disengagement from profit, not as a calculated cooperative tool.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThey rarely receive reward and do not make a visible effort to cultivate it. When they do get small amounts from others, there is no explicit expression of gratitude, no visible alliance‑building, and no clear change in their behavior toward those rewarders. They neither reciprocate selectively nor refer to rewarders positively in chat. Their subsequent contributions and reward use appear unrelated to having been rewarded; they continue oscillating between free‑riding and over‑giving based on their own mood and stance toward the task. This implies very low reciprocity driven by reward signals and a weak tendency to form bilateral cooperative ties. If anything, their reward responses suggest indifference: they notice the coins as part of the payoff but do not integrate them into a social strategy. Their main social reactions are to group criticism and pace of play, not to being individually rewarded."

Early on, they explicitly state an intention to increase their contribution but initially keep their own endowment, benefiting from a highly generous group. After that, they often match or nearly match the emerging “full contribution” norm, but they periodically revert to zero or partial contributions without clear public justification. They do not appear strongly principled about always contributing; instead, they oscillate between cooperative and self-interested behavior. Their giving is not tightly conditioned on specific individuals’ actions, as they keep contributing even when one identified low contributor is being criticized, and they continue to cooperate while others complain about the game length. At times they apologize for “messing up,” which suggests they recognize their deviations from group norms as suboptimal or socially undesirable, but this does not prevent later free-riding. Overall, they value payoff and are willing to exploit a high-contribution environment, but they also repeatedly participate in sustaining that environment rather than purely maximizing short-term personal gain.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThey engage in light, friendly, and somewhat humorous chat, often aligning with the group’s playful tone. They praise the group when cooperation is high and use enthusiastic language to reinforce the positive collective outcome. They speculate about the experiment design (e.g., the possibility of a “mole”) and later endorse the idea that a problematic player is “part of the study,” indicating some meta-level thinking about the game rather than pure myopic focus on coins. When they believe they have deviated from the cooperative pattern in a way that might harm the group, they explicitly acknowledge fault and apologize, showing awareness of social expectations and a desire not to be seen as undermining the group. They do not confront or criticize other specific players; instead, they stay supportive and light-hearted. They respond to ongoing banter (including slang-testing and animal-role jokes) in a way that signals social alignment but do not attempt to lead coordination or establish explicit contribution rules. Their communication style is affiliative and non-confrontational, more about maintaining group morale and belonging than about strict enforcement of norms.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey never spend any of their own coins to reward others, despite having multiple opportunities and being in a high-contribution environment where many others clearly cooperate. This holds even though they themselves receive rewards in multiple later rounds. This pattern suggests they view the reward mechanism as not worth the cost, consistent with comments by others that rewards are inefficient. Since they never reward after being rewarded, their behavior does not reflect direct reciprocal rewarding or strategic use of rewards to shape others’ behavior. Their stance appears either payoff-focused (seeing the cost as too high), or they defer to the emergent group consensus that rewards are generally to be skipped. There is no evidence that they use rewards as a social signal of appreciation or alliance-building.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThey receive rewards several times but never comment directly on being rewarded, never thank anyone, and never reciprocate through the reward mechanism. There is no verbal acknowledgment of rewarders or attempts to form a reward-based alliance. Their only explicit self-referential comment about behavior is an apology-like statement when they believe they “messed up,” which is tied to their contribution choice rather than to receiving rewards. This indicates that their main axis of social accountability is contribution behavior, not reward exchanges. In practical terms, they treat rewards as a passive benefit rather than as part of a reciprocal or relational system, and their observable response to being rewarded is effectively neutral and non-reciprocal."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a mostly high contributor with occasional opportunistic free-riding. After an initial defection, they very quickly align with the group’s cooperative norm and then almost always contribute fully. They defect only when they see that full cooperation is firmly established and others are reliably contributing; in those moments, they take the sure gain from free-riding while still benefiting from the group’s provision. Their pattern suggests they understand the payoff structure well enough to see that mutual cooperation is very profitable, but individual deviation can be even more profitable when others remain cooperative.\n\nThey do not appear to condition their contributions on specific individuals’ behavior; when one teammate begins to shirk, they continue to contribute fully instead of retaliating by reducing their own contribution. This indicates a preference for maintaining group efficiency over enforcing strict reciprocity through their own contribution decisions. Across the game, their contribution behavior is relatively stable: once they “lock in” to the cooperative frame, they only rarely test defection and otherwise act as a consistent cooperator.\n\nThey appear comfortable accepting some inequality: they allow one player to free-ride without mirroring that behavior, and they themselves occasionally exploit the group’s cooperation. There is no clear sign that fairness considerations dominate their decisions; instead, they balance personal gain and group gain, with a slight tilt toward exploiting “free money” opportunities when others are reliably cooperative. Risk tolerance is moderate: they do not repeatedly defect when there is any serious chance the group might unravel; instead, they defect only when cooperation seems safe and entrenched.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nTheir communication is sparse, functional, and slightly impatient. They do not attempt to lead or persuade others about contribution levels, nor do they join in moralizing or shaming. When they do speak, it is to inquire about game length and to express frustration with how long the interaction is taking. This suggests they are attentive to time and cognitive cost and may be somewhat impatient with lengthy or open-ended tasks.\n\nThey show little interest in social bonding or small talk; they ignore others’ light-hearted banter about what they will spend earnings on and do not respond to jokes or role-play. Their engagement style is low-key and instrumental: they speak only when they need structural information that affects their planning. They are not confrontational and do not criticize anyone, even when they themselves have been labeled “greedy” earlier in the game; they choose not to defend themselves or argue.\n\nOverall, their social style is reserved and pragmatic: they quietly adapt to the group’s cooperative norm but remain detached from the relational and playful aspects of the chat.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey are extremely conservative and strategic with rewards. For most of the game, they do not spend anything to reward others, even when many peers are clearly using rewards to acknowledge cooperation. They free-ride on others’ use of reward mechanisms, accepting bonuses when given but not reciprocating in kind. This indicates they view reward spending as a strict monetary tradeoff and are unwilling to reduce their own payoff only to signal appreciation or encourage behavior that is already occurring.\n\nThere is one notable exception: once the game is well underway and cooperative patterns and identities are clear, they make a single, large, symmetric reward outlay to all other players. This looks less like targeted reinforcement and more like a one-off, egalitarian gesture to “catch up” on recognition, possibly in response to feeling that the group has sustained high cooperation for a long period. Even then, they do not differentiate between consistent cooperators and intermittent defectors; they treat everyone identically. This suggests that if they do reward, they prefer simple, all-or-nothing schemes rather than fine-grained, contingent incentives.\n\nThey never use reward as a threat or a selective tool to police behavior; they do not withhold or grant extra units to shape specific individuals. Overall, they are best described as a reward minimalist with a rare, broad generosity event, likely triggered more by a sense of accumulated obligation or endgame slack than by ongoing incentive design.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey closely observe others’ outcomes but respond primarily through their own contributions and one-time reward burst, not through direct commentary. They show no explicit emotional reaction to others sacrificing a lot of coins to reward the group, and they do not verbally praise or criticize heavy rewarders or non-rewarders. However, their eventual symmetric reward move suggests that, at some level, they register the sustained cooperation and perhaps feel a delayed need to reciprocate in aggregate.\n\nWhen others defect on contributions, they do not adjust their own contributions downward or punish via withholding future rewards; they keep cooperating. This indicates a relatively high tolerance for short-term unfairness and a focus on preserving high group payoffs rather than equalizing earnings. They do not react negatively when they themselves are called “greedy,” and they do not seem sensitive to reputation attacks in chat; there is no sign that social disapproval drives their choices.\n\nSpikes in others’ reward spending do not trigger matching behavior or retaliation; they continue their own low-reward strategy. They treat others’ costly generosity as something to accept rather than something that obligates direct response. In summary, they are outcome-aware but behaviorally self-contained: they notice what others do and earn, but modulate their own actions mostly according to their own payoff calculus and occasional, broad-brush reciprocity rather than responsive tit-for-tat."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a verbally pro-cooperation but strategically self-interested conditional cooperator–defector. Early on, they fully contribute and explicitly endorse the logic that everyone investing maximizes group payoffs, indicating they understand the payoff structure and accept full cooperation as the group norm. They publicly criticize a low contributor, signaling an expectation that everyone should contribute fully and that non-contribution is “greedy.” However, once the group has stabilized into a highly cooperative pattern, they begin to intermittently free-ride while others continue to contribute fully. These defections are not preceded by any expressed disappointment or retaliation rationale; instead, they appear opportunistic, exploiting the established norm they helped create. Their pattern alternates between full cooperation and full defection rather than gradual shading down, suggesting a simple binary strategy (all-in vs zero) rather than fine-tuned calibration. They show no visible guilt or justification when free-riding, and they even joke about their behavior when called out, indicating low internalization of fairness norms relative to material gain. They are attentive to the idea of an “end” to the game and mention “one more round,” suggesting some awareness of endpoint effects and a willingness to defect when they believe the game is near over, though they misjudge the horizon. Overall, they are willing to cooperate as long as it doesn’t preclude them from taking lucrative free-riding opportunities once a cooperative environment is in place.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nTheir communication style is upbeat, sociable, and norm-shaping. They actively initiate chat, encourage others, and frame cooperation as a shared project, using inclusive language and group-oriented slogans. They also display mild moralizing behavior, publicly labeling a low contributor as greedy, which serves both as social pressure and as a way to signal their own cooperative identity at that point. They respond to others’ questions and speculation about game length and join casual banter, indicating engagement rather than withdrawal. When their own free-riding is noticed, they do not become defensive; instead, they lean into the “chicken” persona with playful self-description, reframing criticism as humor. They also shift the conversation at one point to what participants will do with their earnings, which distances attention from immediate contribution choices and reaffirms the “we’re all gaining” narrative. Overall, they use communication to build and maintain a friendly, lightly humorous atmosphere, to promote cooperative norms early, and later to soften or deflect scrutiny of their own opportunistic behavior.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey never spend any of their own payoff on rewarding others, despite repeatedly benefiting from rewards given by others. This holds even when the group is highly cooperative and multiple players are actively using rewards to reinforce contributions. There is no instance where they reciprocate reward-giving or use rewards strategically to stabilize cooperation. Their behavior is consistent with a strictly self-maximizing view of the reward mechanism: they accept rewards but never incur a cost to provide them. This indicates low willingness to invest in positive reciprocity or reputation-building via rewards, even under anonymity where free-riding on the reward system is relatively safe. They rely entirely on others to fund the reward environment and appear content to let others bear those costs while they enjoy the extra income. This strongly suggests that, for this player, rewards from their perspective are a windfall to be received, not a tool to be deployed.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey pay attention to others’ contribution behavior and occasionally comment on it, but they do not explicitly reference others’ specific payoffs or reward expenditures. Their reaction to a consistently low contributor is to label that behavior as greedy in chat, indicating a negative normative judgment of free-riding—at least when performed by someone else. When later singled out by another player for not contributing, their response is not to correct course or justify rationally, but to respond playfully and embrace their avatar identity, effectively downplaying the seriousness of the accusation. They do not publicly acknowledge the substantial reward costs borne by certain group members, nor do they express gratitude or concern for players who spend heavily on rewarding others. Despite being a net recipient of rewards over the game, they offer no explicit verbal thanks or reciprocal reward, suggesting that others’ generosity does not substantially shift their strategy. Overall, they notice and comment on conspicuous deviations from cooperation when it is someone else defecting, but they treat both others’ heavy spending on rewards and the group’s tolerance of their own free-riding as exploitable features rather than signals that warrant changing their own behavior."

They consistently avoid both full free-riding and full altruism, instead adopting a contribution that is clearly cooperative but not maximal. Their behavior suggests a balance between self-interest and group interest: they appear willing to support the public good, yet they reserve a substantial portion of their endowment for personal payoff.\n\nTheir contributions remain steady rather than volatile, indicating a simple, pre-chosen rule or anchor rather than reactive adjustment. Despite observing that many others contribute more, they do not move toward matching the highest contributors. This points to a weak or absent fairness-matching norm with respect to high cooperators. At the same time, they are not pulled downward by the presence of low contributors; they maintain their own level even when some others contribute very little. This suggests a mild conditionality: they notice variation in others’ behavior but do not tightly condition their own level on it.\n\nThey appear somewhat risk-averse in social terms: they avoid the personal cost and risk associated with very high contributions when it is unclear how others will behave or how many rounds remain. Their strategy seems simple and robust rather than finely tuned: select a moderate contribution that is socially acceptable yet preserves personal earnings, and stick with it.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nUnknown. There is no observable chat content for this player in the transcript, so their tone, persuasion attempts, responsiveness, and engagement style cannot be inferred. Their willingness to engage in verbal coordination, confront free-riders, or encourage cooperation is therefore unknown.\n\n<REWARD>\nThis player opts not to use the reward mechanism at all, even when others contribute substantially more than they do. They refrain from rewarding high contributors despite having the ability and a clear identification of who is cooperating strongly. This indicates a strong reluctance to incur personal cost purely to reinforce prosocial behavior.\n\nTheir stance suggests that they view reward as strategically unnecessary or personally unappealing in this context. It may reflect a primarily payoff-maximizing orientation within the round: they already secure a good outcome from others’ high contributions and do not invest in maintaining or encouraging that behavior through costly reward. There is no sign that they use reward as a tool for alliance building, signaling approval, or norm-enforcement.\n\nBecause they never reward, their criteria or triggers for rewarding remain unknown; however, observed behavior is consistent with a default rule of “do not spend on rewards” even when candidates for positive reinforcement are available.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nUnknown. This player receives no rewards and therefore shows no observable reaction to being rewarded or to identifiable rewarders. Their propensity for reciprocity, gratitude signaling, or preferential treatment toward those who reward them cannot be inferred.

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a strong, almost rigid high contributor who repeatedly gives the full endowment to the public good in most rounds. Their default norm is “always cooperate fully” rather than “match the group” or “best respond to incentives,” even though the marginal per-capita return is low. They do not appear to optimize for personal payoff; they continue to contribute the maximum even after repeated net losses and repeated punishment from others.\n\nTheir contributions are highly stable for most of the game, with only two clear deviations: a single mid/late-game round and the final round in which they switch to zero contribution. These exceptions are sharp departures from their usual pattern, not gradual decay. This suggests that their baseline rule is categorical (“I give everything”) and that non-contribution is an exceptional, reactive move, not a fine-tuned response to changing averages.\n\nThey do not visibly condition their contributions on others’ average behavior. Average contributions around them fluctuate, and low contributors are present throughout, but this does not lead them to downshift toward the group’s mean. Instead, their cooperative standard is self-imposed and relatively independent of others’ choices. This points to a strong internal fairness or moral norm (“I should contribute fully”) rather than reciprocal tit-for-tat reasoning.\n\nRisk tolerance is high: they consistently expose themselves to exploitation and to punishment risk by being visibly more cooperative than many peers, and they do not hedge by partial contributions. They behave more like an unconditional cooperator with occasional protest/non-cooperation episodes than a cautious or strategic cooperator.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nAwareness of the finite horizon is present but does not drive gradual cooperation decay. For most of the game, including the late-middle phase, they maintain full contributions. There is no smooth end-game unraveling pattern; instead, the response near the horizon is punctuated and reactive.\n\nTwo elements characterize their end-game behavior:\n\n1. **Late reactive defection:** After a long history of full cooperation and substantial use of punishment, they briefly switch to non-contribution once before the final round. This is not aligned with a pure backward-induction logic (which would reduce contributions progressively), but it fits with an emotional/retaliatory or “testing” response to perceived unfairness and hostility (notably, they are repeatedly punished while being a strong contributor).\n\n2. **Final-round withdrawal:** In the last round, they again choose zero contribution. This aligns with a simple heuristic such as “since this is the last chance, and others have not treated me fairly, I no longer owe cooperation.” The fact that they return to full contribution after a prior zero, but drop to zero again only at the very end, suggests they do not fully abandon cooperative identity mid-game; rather, they compartmentalize: “cooperate by default, except in special protest moments and at the true end.”\n\nThere is no evidence they seek to exploit others in the end-game; zero contributions appear tied more to frustration, perceived injustice, or payoff repair than to calculated free-riding on a predictable terminal defection by the group. Their end-game pattern is best described as norm-driven cooperation with late, abrupt exceptions tied to accumulated grievances and the horizon, not as sophisticated horizon-based optimization.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey are willing to use costly punishment and escalate it over time, even when it reduces their own payoffs substantially. Early on, they use punishment sparingly and at low intensity; later, they significantly increase total punishment expenditure. This progression is consistent with growing frustration rather than a pre-planned enforcement schedule.\n\nGiven their consistently high own contributions, the most plausible punishment trigger is norm enforcement against perceived free riders or inconsistent contributors. Their pattern suggests they likely target players who contribute very little or who reduce contributions sharply. Because they themselves are punished multiple times despite high contributions, their later punishment spikes may also incorporate an element of retaliation or generalized anger at the group (“antisocial punishment of antisocial punishers”), though who they target is unknown.\n\nThey are not purely efficiency-oriented: in this environment, punishment is relatively potent but still costly. Their heavy use of it, especially later, indicates they prioritize expressing disapproval and enforcing a cooperative norm over maximizing their own monetary outcome. Deterrence is a plausible motive — trying to discipline chronic low contributors — but the scale and timing of later sanctions (when many rounds have already passed and gains from future cooperation are limited) suggests that emotional or justice-oriented motives are at least as important as instrumental ones.\n\nThey are selective in the sense that they do not punish in every opportunity, and they abstain from punishment in many rounds while still being exploited and punished themselves. This indicates some threshold or internal rule (“tolerate noise, but punish when behavior crosses a line”); the precise trigger is unknown, but it is unlikely to be random, given the sparse early punishment and heavier late use. Overall, they function as a principled, high-cost norm enforcer who becomes increasingly punitive when the group’s behavior violates their cooperative expectations and when they personally experience unfair punishment."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a strict, unwavering full cooperator. They always contribute their entire endowment, with no experimentation or decay, regardless of others’ behavior, the punishment environment, or the approaching end of the game. Their cooperation is unconditional rather than tit‑for‑tat: they continue to fully contribute even when low contributors persist and even when they themselves incur large costs from punishing or rewarding. This suggests they treat full contribution as a normative rule (“the right thing to do”), not a fragile strategy contingent on others. They appear risk‑tolerant about potentially being exploited by low contributors, prioritizing group efficiency or fairness norms over own short‑term payoff. There is no evidence that they adjust contributions based on earnings, punishment they give, or patterns of others’ cooperation; their contribution behavior is highly stable and rigid.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThere is no end‑game decay in cooperation: they maintain full contributions through the final round. However, their use of sanctioning shifts somewhat: they employ both punishment and reward in earlier and mid stages, and remain willing to use costly punishment up to the last round. This indicates horizon awareness does not lead them to “cash out” or relax norms; if anything, they uphold contribution standards to the very end. Their normative stance on contribution appears time‑invariant. Whether they consciously anticipate that future interactions are limited is unknown, but their behavior is consistent with a player who values norm enforcement independently of future strategic gain.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey are willing to incur substantial personal costs to punish, but they do so selectively, triggered mainly by marked deviations from what looks like their internal cooperation standard. Targets are typically very low contributors compared to the group, and they focus especially on extreme or repeated low contributors. They occasionally expand punishment to moderate under‑contributors when their deviation is large relative to a highly cooperative environment. They never punish high contributors or evident cooperators.\n\nThey sometimes coordinate their punishment with what others seem to be doing (e.g., joining collective sanctions on chronic low contributors), which suggests a belief that punishment is appropriate for norm violators and perhaps more effective when multiple players participate. They sometimes allocate multiple punishment units across several low contributors in a single decision, indicating they are motivated by enforcing a general cooperation norm rather than a single, personalized grudge.\n\nTheir punishment pattern appears primarily deterrence‑ or norm‑driven (altruistic punishment) rather than retaliatory: they are not being personally targeted by others, yet they pay large amounts to reduce defectors’ payoffs. They do not use punishment against players who punish others, or against high contributors who might threaten their relative payoff, which suggests low competitiveness and low spite. When a player contributes nothing while others remain highly cooperative, they react with clear punitive action, even in the final round, consistent with a strong intolerance of blatant free‑riding.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nThey are never punished in this game, so their behavioral response to being punished is unknown. There is no evidence of retaliatory tendencies toward punishers, nor of compliance after being sanctioned, because they do not experience sanctions. Given their unwavering cooperation across all rounds, they already comply with a strict norm of contribution, so any hypothetical punishment would be norm‑incongruent and their reaction is uncertain.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey use rewards fairly often and in a pattern that is clearly contingent on others’ cooperation levels. They reserve rewards for consistently high contributors or those who match or exceed the group norm, and they never reward clear under‑contributors. They frequently direct rewards to the same cooperative individuals across multiple opportunities, indicating an attempt to reinforce and encourage a stable coalition of high contributors. They sometimes use reward alone, and sometimes mix it with punishment in the same decision, suggesting they view reward and punishment as complementary tools: reward to support cooperators, punishment to correct defectors.\n\nThey are willing to sacrifice substantial own earnings to provide these rewards, even when the reward technology is merely break‑even (no social multiplier). This implies they are not using reward purely as an instrumental payoff‑maximizing tool but as a normative or relational signal—supporting “good citizens” of the group. Their reward allocation seems strategic in a social sense (reinforcing desirable behavior and perhaps fostering allegiance), but not narrowly self‑interested in terms of immediate income.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThey receive occasional rewards from others, but their own behavior (full contributions plus targeted reward and punishment) does not appear to change in direct response. They do not explicitly reciprocate rewards in a one‑to‑one fashion; rather, they continue to reward high contributors in general, some of whom also reward them and some of whom do not. This suggests they operate on a rule like “reward good cooperators” rather than “reward my rewarders.” They do not form a visible exclusive alliance with any single rewarder; instead, their reward behavior remains principled and pattern‑based.\n\nTheir continued generosity toward certain high contributors, even without direct reciprocation from those specific players in some periods, hints at a stable cooperative orientation rather than purely dyadic reciprocity. That said, because they are themselves often in the set of top cooperators, they may expect that maintaining a cooperative core will in aggregate benefit them, but this expectation is inferred with low confidence.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey pay close attention to others’ contributions and to the sanctioning environment, and they condition their punishments and rewards on those outcomes. When they see low contributors being sanctioned by others, they often join in or maintain pressure on those same players, consistent with endorsing a shared norm of high contribution. When they see very high contributors, they tend to reward them, even if those players already have strong payoffs, indicating they care more about reinforcing behavior than equalizing incomes.\n\nThey do not appear concerned with strict payoff equality. They do not punish successful high earners who contribute fully, nor do they reward low earners whose low income stems from having been punished for free‑riding. Their reactions are aligned with contribution behavior, not with final payoff levels per se. They seem comfortable allowing punished defectors to end up very poor if that reflects their prior under‑contribution.\n\nThey are willing to incur large costs in rounds where their own payoff becomes very low relative to others due to heavy use of punishment and reward. This shows they tolerate short‑term personal loss when using sanctions to influence group behavior. There is no sign that they later “compensate” themselves by defecting or by exploiting unpunished others; they continue to contribute fully and to sanction according to their norm. Overall, they behave as a principled, strong‑norm altruistic cooperator: they track others’ actions closely, respond sharply to norm violations, reinforce high cooperation, and accept personal cost to maintain a high‑contribution environment."

They always contribute the full endowment, with no experimentation, no reaction to fluctuations in group behavior, and no visible adjustment to being punished. Their cooperation is stable and rigid rather than strategic: they do not reduce contributions even when many others free‑ride or when overall group contributions are low. This suggests they either prioritize the social-optimal outcome or adhere to a strong internal norm that “one should always contribute,” even when the immediate incentive points the other way. They appear tolerant of exploitation in contribution decisions themselves: they do not use their own contribution as leverage to discipline low contributors, instead separating cooperation from enforcement. Risk tolerance in contribution is high: they consistently expose themselves to being the “sucker” who contributes while others do not, and they do not hedge by ever keeping their endowment. Their fairness norm is asymmetric: they demand fairness via punishment, but they never withdraw their own cooperative effort to protect themselves from unfairness. There is no evidence of conditional cooperation based on observed averages; their behavior fits a “moralist cooperator” or “principled cooperator” profile whose contributions are rule-driven rather than payoff-optimizing.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nAwareness of the horizon does not change their cooperative stance: they continue full contributions through the final rounds with no end-game defection. They do not display the typical decay in cooperation; instead, their final-round behavior mirrors their initial behavior. Punishment usage in late rounds fluctuates but does not escalate simply because the game is ending; there is no clear pattern of “last-round revenge” or opportunistic exploitation. Their strategy appears time-invariant: they do not relax norms near the end and do not exploit the group even when future retaliation is impossible. This suggests they treat each round as a separate moral or rule-based decision rather than as part of a backward-induction logic. Any beliefs about others’ horizon reasoning are unknown, but they act as if cooperation should be maintained to the end regardless of others’ likely defection. Overall, they show end-game norm persistence rather than strategic tapering.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThis player is a willing and recurrent punisher, often spending a substantial share of their payoff to impose costs on others. They sometimes punish heavily and at other times abstain, indicating situational selectivity rather than constant aggression. The most plausible trigger is low or zero contribution relative to the apparent group norm: they repeatedly face environments with clear free-riders, and their punishment spending tends to coincide with such environments. There is no evidence they ever punish high contributors, so antisocial punishment is not clearly supported (though not entirely ruled out; target-level data is unknown). Their punishment appears norm-enforcing and deterrence-oriented: they sacrifice their own earnings consistently to discipline others, even when it costs them a large portion of that round’s payoff and even when they themselves have been punished. They do not respond to receiving punishment by retaliating through lower contributions, and whether they directly counter-punish is unknown because identities of punishers are hidden. Their pattern is consistent with a “strong reciprocator” who cooperates fully and uses costly, sometimes intense punishment to push the group toward higher contribution. They do not refine their use of punishment over time in an obviously payoff-maximizing way; instead, its use remains principled and sometimes expensive, indicating a strong preference for enforcing cooperation norms over maximizing personal profit."

Their behavior does not adjust to variation in others’ average contributions, nor to shifts in specific peers’ behavior. They appear to hold a strong fairness or efficiency norm favoring maximal group contribution and are willing to uphold that norm regardless of apparent free-riding by specific players. There is no observable risk aversion in their contribution decisions; they accept the risk of being exploited by lower contributors without reducing their own input. Their contribution pattern suggests a principled or rule-based cooperator rather than a cautious, conditional cooperator.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThere is no observable end-game decay in cooperation: the player maintains maximal contribution through to the final round, despite knowing the horizon and seeing continued free-riding by some others. Instead of withdrawing cooperation near the end, they escalate punitive actions against low contributors. This indicates awareness of the game’s end (they see remaining rounds and radically intensify punishment in the last rounds) but a choice to use the end-game mainly to enforce or express norms rather than to defect for short-term gain. Their strategy in the final stage appears expressive or norm-enforcing, not purely payoff-maximizing.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThe player is highly willing to punish and targets those they perceive as persistent low contributors. They direct punishment selectively toward the most obvious free-rider and toward a moderate under-contributor whose behavior deviates from the near-full-contribution majority. They do not punish high contributors. Over time, their punishment escalates in intensity and frequency toward the same targets, indicating that repeated norm violations are a strong trigger. They continue to punish even when low contributors do not adjust upward, suggesting that their motive likely includes moralistic or expressive punishment rather than purely instrumental deterrence. They repeatedly bear substantial personal cost to impose very large deductions on low contributors, even when cooperation is already high among others and even when it is late in the game. This pattern suggests a strong inequity-averse or justice-enforcing tendency and a willingness to sacrifice own payoff to sanction behavior they deem unfair.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nUnknown. The transcript provides no instance of this player being punished, so their reactions to being sanctioned—whether retaliatory, compliant, or forgiving—cannot be inferred.\n\n<REWARD>\nThe player never uses the reward option despite repeatedly observing high contributions by most group members. They decline to reward those who consistently match their full contribution, and they do not reciprocate when others reward them on rare occasions. Given that they do use punishment extensively, this asymmetry suggests a strong preference for negative over positive enforcement. It may reflect a view that high contributions are expected baseline behavior and do not merit costly reinforcement, whereas deviation below that norm merits active sanction. It may also indicate sensitivity to the relatively poor cost-effectiveness of the reward technology compared to punishment, though this is inferred with low confidence. Overall, they are a zero-reward, punishment-focused enforcer.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThe player receives small positive transfers from others but does not alter their contribution level or begin rewarding in response. There is no observable reciprocation toward those who reward them, and no shift away from punishing low contributors. This suggests that gratitude-based reciprocity, alliance building, or strategic “thanking” do not play a meaningful role in their behavior within this game. They appear largely unmoved by positive social signals in their strategic choices.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThe player appears attentive to others’ contribution patterns and to the distribution of punishment. Their choice of targets aligns with persistent under-contributors, and they do not spread punishment broadly, indicating that they track who is relatively unfair rather than responding randomly or purely emotionally to outcomes. They do not copy other players’ strong use of punishment against cooperators; instead, they keep sanctioning focused on free-riders and under-contributors, which suggests independent judgment and a clear internal standard. They do not react to others’ high payoffs by imposing envy-driven punishment on high earners; instead, they tolerate high payoffs when they arise from high contributions. The player also does not seem to modulate their own contribution or sanctioning in response to others’ heavy use of punishment overall; they maintain full cooperation and intensify their own targeted sanctions against low contributors even as the environment grows more punitive. This points to a relatively stable, norm-driven persona: a strict, high-cooperation, punishment-heavy enforcer who prioritizes contribution fairness over personal earnings and does not rely on rewards or reciprocal favors to shape behavior."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a stable, unconditional full cooperator. They always contribute their entire endowment, without adjusting to variations in others’ contributions or to shifting punishment patterns around them. Their behavior suggests a strong fairness or efficiency norm: the public project is treated as the default rightful destination of all available resources, regardless of personal payoff consequences. They do not appear risk‑averse in the narrow monetary sense; they accept systematically lower individual payoffs than they could obtain by contributing less, even when free riding is persistent and heavily sanctioned. There is no evidence that they condition their contribution on others’ past behavior, nor that they strategically reduce contributions in response to exploitation or to end‑game proximity. Their cooperative stance appears principled rather than instrumentally optimized.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nAwareness of the finite horizon does not reduce their cooperation; they maintain maximal contributions through to the final round. Rather than displaying standard end‑game decay, they escalate costly punishment of low contributors at the very end, indicating that the horizon either does not weaken their norm enforcement motives or even strengthens a desire to “settle accounts.” They do not appear to be optimizing final‑round monetary payoff; instead, they prioritize enforcing contribution norms and expressing disapproval of free riding when there is no future opportunity for behavioral change. This points to a type that is relatively insensitive to future‑oriented strategic incentives and more driven by deontological or expressive motives.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey are a frequent and heavy punisher, willing to spend large amounts of their own payoff to impose large deductions on specific targets. Punishment is strongly contribution‑based and asymmetric: they consistently sanction the pure free rider and, to a lesser but still substantial extent, a persistent low contributor who gives below the prevailing cooperative standard. They do not punish high contributors or average‑to‑high cooperators, even when those players also punish others, which suggests their punishment is not retaliatory but norm‑enforcing. They show selectivity: only distinct under‑contributors are targeted, with intensity roughly tracking deviation from what appears to be their internal “full or near‑full contribution” standard. Over time, despite under‑contributors not clearly changing their pattern in a sustained way, they continue—and at the end increase—the intensity of sanctions, which indicates that deterrence is not their sole motive. Punishment also serves an expressive or retributive function: they act to equalize or morally rebalance outcomes even when it is inefficient and when learning opportunities for others are nearly over. They never use “mild” punishment as a calibrated signal; instead, they readily escalate to high levels, especially against a habitual free rider, signaling low tolerance for norm violations and a willingness to incur high cost for enforcement.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nNo one ever punishes this player, so their direct response to being punished is unknown. Because punishers are identifiable and they consistently refrain from punishing other high contributors—even those who themselves punish others—it is plausible (but uncertain) that they would not engage in retaliatory punishment simply for being sanctioned; their pattern is focused on contribution levels rather than on who punishes whom. However, this remains speculative; actual behavior under personal sanction is not observed.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey never reward anyone, despite the presence of consistently high contributors who match their cooperative effort. This is not because they lack opportunities or candidates; instead, the pattern indicates a strong asymmetry between punishment and reward. They appear to assign primary responsibility for maintaining cooperation to negative sanctions rather than positive reinforcement. The relatively low “leverage” of rewards compared to punishment may contribute to this choice, but they also ignore opportunities to provide even symbolic or low‑cost rewards. This suggests that they are a “pure punishing cooperator”: they cooperate fully and enforce cooperation through costly punishment, but do not use or apparently value material gratitude or positive reciprocity tools within the game.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThey are never rewarded, so their behavioral response to receiving identifiable rewards is unknown. There is no evidence on whether they would reciprocate rewards, form alliances, or shift punishment/reward strategies in response to being positively recognized.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey pay close attention to others’ contributions and adjust punishment targets accordingly, but they do not soften sanctions based on how badly targets have already been punished by others. Even when a low contributor is already incurring large deductions and ending rounds with very low or negative net payoffs, this player continues or escalates sanctions rather than moderating them. This indicates relatively low concern for the marginal suffering or disadvantage of under‑contributors once they are categorized as norm violators. Conversely, they show implicit solidarity with high contributors: they never punish them despite the fact that these players sometimes incur costs to punish others. They do not mirror others’ punishment patterns; instead, they maintain their own enforcement rule centered on contribution levels. Overall, they track outcomes mainly as a means to identify and repeatedly target free riders and under‑contributors, not to equalize everyone’s final payoffs or to coordinate with other punishers."

They consistently give their full endowment to the public good in every situation, regardless of others’ behavior, punishment patterns, or proximity to the final round. They appear to follow a strong internal norm that “full contribution is the right thing,” rather than conditioning on others’ average. They do not shade contributions downward even when some group members persistently free-ride or reduce their giving. This suggests a preference for efficient group outcomes and a willingness to bear personal risk that others may not reciprocate. There is no evidence of strategic under-contribution or profit-maximizing adjustment; their cooperative stance is fixed and robust across the game.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThe player shows no end-game decay in cooperation. Their contribution remains maximal through the last round, even as some others reduce their contributions and the remaining horizon shrinks to zero.

In the final round, they escalate punitive enforcement against low contributors rather than relaxing effort, which is consistent with a desire to end the game affirming norms rather than exploiting the final move. They appear fully aware of the horizon (interface displays remaining rounds), but their behavior suggests horizon awareness does not alter their cooperative or enforcement strategy.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThe player is willing to incur substantial personal costs to punish low contributors, especially clear free-riders and persistent under-contributors. Their punishment is selective: they target those who contribute markedly less than the rest of the group, not high contributors. They do not punish indiscriminately; they ignore cooperators and focus on those whose behavior repeatedly violates the apparent contribution norm. Punishment intensity escalates over time against repeat low contributors, particularly in the final rounds, indicating a norm-enforcement or “teaching a lesson” motive rather than a one-off emotional reaction. They are willing to spend enough to drive punished players’ payoffs extremely low, even negative, which is inconsistent with pure payoff maximization and more consistent with strong negative reciprocity or altruistic punishment. There is no evidence that they punish for personal retaliation (they are never punished), so the motive appears to be deterrence, expression of disapproval, or retributive justice against free-riding rather than self-defense.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nThe player is not punished by others during the observed game, so their direct response to being punished is unknown. Because they are consistently a top contributor and a punisher rather than a target, we see no evidence of how they would react to identifiable punishment. Their likely willingness to maintain high contributions in the face of others’ negative actions is suggested by their overall rigidity, but this is speculative and therefore low confidence.\n\n<REWARD>\nThe player never uses the reward option, despite having many opportunities to do so and being surrounded by several consistently high contributors. This suggests either that they view costly reward as inefficient (since the technology is payoff-destroying) or that their social preference is primarily punitive rather than prosocial-reciprocal. Their behavior fits a “carrot-averse, stick-accepting” pattern: they are willing to pay to reduce free-riders’ outcomes but are not willing to pay, at a loss, to increase cooperators’ payoffs. This may reflect a norm that good behavior is expected and does not merit extra compensation, while bad behavior deserves sanction. It may also reflect attention focus: they appear to key on deviations below the norm, not above it.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThe player is never rewarded by others, so there is no direct evidence on how they respond to being rewarded or to identifiable rewarders. Their cooperative behavior is already maximal and stable, so any additional reinforcement, if it occurred, might not change their actions. Their reaction style (gratitude, alliance formation, increased leniency) is unknown.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThe player appears to track others’ contribution levels and how heavily they are already being sanctioned. They do not automatically “pile on” every low contributor each round; instead, they sometimes refrain from punishing when others are already heavily sanctioning, and at other times they join in or escalate punishment when under-contribution persists. They never direct sanctions or rewards toward high contributors, suggesting a clear internal mapping between observed contributions and deserved outcomes. Their later strong sanctions suggest that they infer persistent under-contributors are intentionally exploiting the group, and they become more willing to impose very harsh monetary consequences on them over time. They do not respond visibly to how much others punish or reward beyond aligning their own pattern with the contribution behavior of targets; there is no evidence of meta-punishment (punishing punishers) or conflict with other enforcers. Overall, they use others’ outcomes primarily as information about who is free-riding and how effective sanctions have been, and then adjust punishment intensity upward against recalcitrant low contributors while leaving cooperators untouched."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a stable, unconditional high contributor. They always contribute the full endowment, regardless of others’ past or current behavior, even when surrounded by persistent free-riding or low contribution from specific individuals and even at the very end of the game. This suggests a strong internal norm for full cooperation that is not contingent on immediate reciprocity. They appear comfortable accepting personal payoff losses from this stance, prioritizing the social optimum and norm consistency over short-term individual gain. Risk tolerance for being exploited is high; they do not reduce contributions in response to visible non-cooperation, instead relying on punishment rather than contribution adjustment to manage norm violations. Fairness, in their contribution choices, is defined as “everyone should contribute maximally” rather than proportionally to others’ actual behavior.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThere is no observable end-game decay in their cooperation: they continue to contribute fully in the final round, despite knowing the game is about to end and despite persistent low contributions by certain players. At the same time, they escalate punitive intensity against chronic low contributors toward the end, even when monetary deterrence value is minimal due to the short remaining horizon. This pattern indicates horizon awareness but a priority on enforcing norms and expressing disapproval over maximizing final monetary payoff. Their end-game response is characterized by stable cooperation plus intensified norm enforcement, not by strategic defection.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey are a frequent, heavy, and targeted punisher. They consistently direct punishment toward those contributing substantially below their own full-contribution norm, with particular focus on chronic or extreme free-riders. They also punish repeated moderate under-contribution, treating it as a meaningful violation even when the rest of the group mostly cooperates. The size of sanctions is often large, sometimes very costly to themselves, which suggests strong willingness to incur personal cost to discipline perceived defectors. Their punishment appears primarily norm-enforcing and deterrent, not retaliatory: they do not target high contributors, and there is no evidence they punish in response to being personally punished (they are never punished). They also never use reward, despite having the option, indicating that their cooperative norm is enforced mainly through negative sanctions rather than positive reinforcement. Their punishment selectivity is high—only those below a high contribution benchmark are targeted—but within that target set they are willing to escalate sharply, including at the very end of the game when future behavioral change is unlikely. This pattern is consistent with strong negative reciprocity and a preference for “moralistic” enforcement, where wrongdoers should suffer even if it does not improve future outcomes.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nUnknown. In this interaction, no one ever punishes them, so there is no behavioral evidence on how they respond to being sanctioned, whether they would retaliate, comply by increasing contributions, or forgive.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey never reward any other player, even when others contribute fully and even when some players spend substantial amounts punishing defectors in a way that aligns with their own norm. This absence persists throughout, despite many opportunities to provide positive reinforcement. Given this, their cooperative enforcement style is one-sidedly punitive rather than balanced between reward and punishment. Their unwillingness to reward may partly reflect the low efficiency of the reward mechanism relative to punishment, but they do not appear to use reward even strategically to build alliances or encourage already-cooperative behavior. For this player, good behavior seems expected and not something that merits extra payoff; only deviations provoke costly action.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThey are rewarded occasionally by others but do not reciprocate with rewards or alter contribution behavior in response. Since they are already at maximum contribution throughout, there is no upward behavioral shift possible, but they also do not reciprocate with reward to those who rewarded them. This indicates that being rewarded does not change their enforcement strategy; they remain purely punitive and do not transition into a mutual-reward or alliance-building mode. Their reaction to being rewarded is behaviorally neutral: they maintain full cooperation and continue to focus exclusively on punishing under-contributors.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey pay close attention to others’ contribution levels and outcomes and seem especially responsive to persistent low contributions irrespective of the punished players’ final payoffs. They are willing to impose punishment that drives some players’ payoffs extremely low or negative, indicating low concern for the punished players’ welfare once they are classified as defectors. There is no evidence they soften sanctions when others have already been heavily punished by third parties in the same round; they add their own punishment on top, suggesting they value norm expression and personal enforcement over efficiency or proportionality to total sanctions received. Conversely, they ignore opportunities to reward high-contributing players or heavy punishers, showing little interest in compensating for others’ sanction costs or evening out final payoffs among cooperators. Overall, they respond to others’ outcomes primarily through the lens of norm compliance: low contributors are aggressively sanctioned regardless of how hard others also hit them; high contributors and punishers of defectors are left to enjoy or bear their outcomes without further intervention."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a consistently above-average cooperator who mixes moderate and high contributions with occasional small downward adjustments. They rarely free-ride and never choose the minimum; their typical choice lies somewhat above the group mean. They appear guided by a fairness norm that expects roughly mid-to-high contributions from everyone and treats very low contributors as norm violators. Their contribution level is relatively stable over time, with minor fluctuations that do not show sharp decay, even after being targeted by punishment. They do not strongly condition their contributions on short-term personal payoff changes; instead, they maintain a cooperative baseline and tweak around it. Risk tolerance appears moderate: they are willing to fully cooperate at times even after being punished, suggesting they accept short-term vulnerability to sustain the public good, but they also occasionally lower their contribution, indicating some sensitivity to being exploited.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThey show no substantial end-game collapse in contributions. Even in the final rounds, they maintain moderate contributions rather than dropping to zero or to clear free-riding levels. They continue to use punishment actively in the final round, including toward a sudden low contributor, indicating that they remain norm-enforcing rather than switching to purely self-maximizing play. Horizon awareness is present in that their pattern of targeting appears refined and consistent by the late game, but they do not relax their standards or “cash out” in contribution or in sanctioning. This suggests a type that treats norm enforcement and cooperation as intrinsic or habit-like, not something to abandon once future interaction is limited.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey are a heavy and systematic punisher who focuses almost exclusively on low contributors and clear deviations from their internal standard. They use punishment frequently and at nontrivial personal cost, often targeting the same low-contribution individuals across multiple rounds. They also punish occasional moderate deviations when these are notably below the emerging group norm or below what they themselves give. High contributors are never punished by them, and they do not appear to use punishment competitively or retaliatorily; their targets are consistently those who contribute clearly less than the majority. This pattern aligns with strong altruistic norm enforcement: they bear significant costs to reduce the payoffs of under-contributors and to signal a minimum acceptable cooperation level. They do not appear to use punishment strategically to influence rewards or to form coalitions; it is primarily corrective and deterrent, aimed at enforcing a fairness norm on contributions.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nWhen they are punished, they show no evidence of retaliation, even when the punishment costs them and the punisher is identifiable. Their subsequent behavior does not include counter-punishing those who punished them, nor do they reduce their contributions in a clear act of defiance. Instead, they either maintain or even raise their contribution levels afterward. This indicates a forgiving or at least non-retaliatory disposition: they do not use sanctioning to fight back or engage in vendettas. There is also no clear sign that they strategically appease punishers by altering whom they sanction; their punishment focus remains on low contributors. Overall, they treat being punished as separate from their own norm-enforcing agenda, and they continue to apply their standards regardless of who targeted them.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey effectively never reward, despite many opportunities and despite the presence of numerous consistently high contributors. This is not due to lack of information but appears to be a principled or preference-based choice. Given that the reward mechanism is relatively inefficient compared to punishment, one plausible interpretation is that they prioritize cost-effective norm enforcement and view punishment as the primary tool, while considering rewards as unnecessary or wasteful. They do not appear to use rewards strategically to build alliances or reinforce high cooperation; instead, they rely solely on punishment to shape behavior. This marks them as a “pure sanctioning” type: they are willing to pay to reduce defectors’ payoffs, but not to subsidize cooperators.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThey are occasionally rewarded by others but never visibly change their subsequent behavior to favor those rewarders, either through reciprocal rewards or through selective leniency in punishment. There is no sign that they respond to being rewarded with alliance-building or gratitude-based reciprocity. Their contribution levels remain within their usual band and their punishment targets continue to be determined by contribution levels rather than by prior help received. This suggests that they are relatively insensitive to positive incentives in social terms: they neither seek nor reciprocate reward, maintaining a rule-based approach centered on contribution norms rather than on interpersonal exchange.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey pay close attention to others’ contribution levels and, implicitly, to resulting payoffs, but they do not appear swayed by who is currently rich or poor; their reactions track cooperation rather than earnings. Players who repeatedly contribute low are repeatedly sanctioned by them, even when those players are already being heavily punished by others, suggesting a desire to reinforce the social signal rather than to optimize marginal deterrence alone. They do not punish high earners if those earnings arise from high contributions, implying no envy-based behavior. Conversely, they do not reward high contributors even when those contributors earn strong payoffs, indicating that outcome admiration does not translate into positive transfers. They are also not evidently reacting to others’ punishment or reward expenditures by adjusting their own; they remain focused on their own norm standard rather than coordinating on a shared punishment strategy. Overall, they behave like an independently motivated, contribution-focused enforcer: others’ outcomes matter to them mainly insofar as they reveal who is under-contributing relative to the group norm."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a stable, unconditional high contributor. They always give the full endowment, with no variation, regardless of others’ behavior, fluctuations in group contributions, or aggressive punishment dynamics in the group. They do not appear to condition their contributions on others’ past choices, on being rewarded, or on the presence of chronic low contributors. This indicates a strong internal cooperation norm that does not update with experience, rather than a calculated best response to the environment. They tolerate being among the highest contributors without attempting to free-ride or “balance” fairness ex post. Risk tolerance is high in the sense of consistently foregoing safe private payoffs to fund the public good, even when others free-ride or when payoff volatility (from punishment) is high. Their fairness norm is contribution-focused: they keep their own behavior cooperative but do not actively enforce equal contributions on others.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThere is no end-game decay in cooperation: the player maintains full contributions through to the final round, including when at least one peer sharply reduces contribution at the very end. They do not appear to switch to selfish play even when the horizon is very short and reputational or future-return motives are minimized. Their strategy is time-invariant; either they do not put weight on backward induction logic, or they prioritize a fixed cooperative principle over payoff-maximizing end-game adjustment. They also do not ramp up or change use of reward or punishment as the end approaches; sanction behavior stays minimal and sporadic, suggesting limited strategic horizon-based planning overall.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThe player never uses punishment, despite multiple opportunities and clear evidence of persistent low contributors and disruptive actors. They refrain from punishing both clear under-contributors and potential norm violators, even when punishment by others is frequent and severe. This indicates a strong reluctance to engage in costly harm, even when it could be economically effective and socially supported. Their motive structure appears non-retaliatory and non-deterrent: they do not use punishment to discipline, to even scores, or to respond to personal disadvantage. This is consistent with a prosocial but non-enforcing “cooperative pacifist” type: willing to contribute heavily to the common good but unwilling to incur costs to inflict losses on others, regardless of group norms or efficiency arguments.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nThe player is never punished in this game; thus there is no direct evidence of how they respond to identifiable punishers. Their standing as a consistent full contributor makes them an unlikely target for norm-enforcing punishment, and indeed no one directs punishment at them. As a result, their tendencies regarding forgiveness, retaliation, or conforming in response to being punished are unknown. Given their general avoidance of punishment toward others, a cautious inference (low confidence) is that they may be disinclined to retaliate even if punished, but this is not behaviorally tested here.\n\n<REWARD>\nThe player uses reward sparingly but deliberately. They reward only a few times across the game and always choose clear high contributors or especially cooperative peers. They never reward low or erratic contributors, even when those players are heavily targeted by others. Reward choices suggest an attempt to positively reinforce strong cooperation, possibly to acknowledge consistent contributors or to encourage an emerging cooperative cluster. However, they do not escalate into systematic “bonus” payments or broad mutual-reward cycles; they remain highly selective and low-intensity in reward use. This pattern is consistent with a frugal prosocial type: willing to spend a little to reinforce good behavior but not to run an expensive reward regime. There is no sign they use reward tactically to buy allies or to offset others’ punishment; the targets are already prosocial by contribution behavior.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThe player receives rewards from others on several occasions and continues to contribute fully before and after being rewarded. They do not appear to change their sanction behavior—neither to reciprocally reward their benefactors nor to form a visible “reward club.” They also do not start punishing on behalf of those who reward them. Their contribution pattern is already maximally cooperative, so there is no upward shift to observe; the main effect is that their behavior remains unchanged. This suggests that their cooperation is driven more by internal norms or stable preferences than by direct reciprocity to specific rewarders. Any reciprocity or alliance-building motive, if present, is subtle or overshadowed by their fixed strategy; explicit reciprocal reward to particular individuals is not clearly expressed.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThe player shows awareness of others’ outcomes (since they see all payoffs and sanction flows) but does not visibly react in their own strategy. They observe repeated, sometimes harsh punishment patterns, including concentrated punishment of certain low contributors and extensive sanction spending by some high contributors. Despite this, they neither join in punishment nor adjust contributions in response to changing payoff landscapes, inequities, or the emergence of punitive “enforcers.” Likewise, when some peers suffer large net losses or negative payoffs from being heavily punished, the player does not step in to counterbalance with rewards. Their behavior indicates a separation between their own prosocial norm (always contribute fully, occasionally reward cooperative peers) and the broader payoff dynamics. They seem indifferent, in strategic terms, to others’ exact payoffs, focusing instead on sustaining their own cooperative pattern and occasionally signaling approval of high contributors, without engaging in payoff-level correction or coalition behavior. Overall, they are a principled, non-interventionist cooperator who watches but does not strategically exploit or repair the sanction structure around them."

They always allocate their entire endowment to the public fund, with no adjustments in response to changes in group behavior, personal losses, or observed free-riding. Their cooperation is extremely stable and not contingent on others’ contributions, even when they are relatively high compared to several peers and even after being targeted by punishment. This suggests a strong internal norm to “do the maximum cooperative thing” rather than a payoff-maximizing strategy.\n\nThey appear to prioritize group efficiency over personal earnings: contributing fully is individually costly in this parameter setting, but they never deviate. There is no evidence that they attempt to optimize against the marginal per-capita return; instead, they seem to act as if contributing fully is the “right” baseline, independent of whether it strictly increases their own payoff.\n\nThey tolerate substantial heterogeneity and persistent under-contribution by some others without reducing their own contribution. This indicates a fairness norm focused on their own behavior (“I should contribute fully”) rather than reciprocity-based fairness (“I match what others do”). Their risk tolerance with respect to exploitation by free-riders is high: they repeatedly expose themselves to the risk of earning less relative to low contributors but persist in full cooperation.\n\nBecause they never change their contribution level, their learning and adaptation on the contribution dimension are either absent or extremely limited; if beliefs about others’ cooperativeness update, those belief changes do not translate into behavioral adjustment in contributions. Overall, they behave as a principled, high-commitment cooperator whose cooperative identity dominates short-run monetary incentives.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThis player is generally non-punitive but not categorically opposed to punishment. Across most opportunities, they abstain from punishing despite the presence of clear free-riders and low contributors. This pattern suggests that punishment is not their default tool for enforcing norms; they likely accept some level of exploitation without intervening.\n\nThey do, however, punish on one occasion. That punishment occurs in a context where their own contribution remains maximal and several others contribute substantially less. Because the target of their punishment is unobservable here, their exact trigger is uncertain. The most plausible interpretation is that they occasionally engage in selective, norm-enforcing punishment toward conspicuous under-contributors rather than retaliating against those who punished them earlier or punishing moderate deviations. The fact that they previously suffered substantial deductions yet did not respond with immediate or repeated punishment makes a pure retaliation motive less likely, though not fully excludable.\n\nTheir one act of punishment is limited in scale relative to what would be possible, suggesting they do not pursue aggressive, repeated sanctioning to reshape group behavior; instead, they behave more like a reluctant norm enforcer who is willing to spend a small amount to sanction behavior they perceive as especially unfair or harmful to cooperation.\n\nThey never escalate into a sustained punishment campaign, even though free-riding persists and they themselves are never seen as a low contributor. This implies that deterrence is at best a weak or secondary motive for them; they are not systematically trying to engineer higher group contributions via targeted sanctions. Overall, they present as a principled cooperator with a strong bias against using punishment, who only occasionally and modestly deploys it, likely in response to perceived severe norm violations rather than as an ongoing strategic instrument."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a predominantly high contributor who mixes genuine cooperation with calculated free-riding. They usually give the full endowment when the group appears cohesive and generous, but intermittently drop their contribution well below the group norm to exploit others’ cooperation.\n\nTheir contribution pattern is moderately volatile rather than stable. Periods of full cooperation are punctuated by occasional medium contributions and a few very low or zero contributions. These reductions do not follow a simple “tit-for-tat” with individual defectors; instead, they reflect opportunistic tests of how much they can keep while still benefiting from a generally cooperative group.\n\nThey appear to understand that the public good is highly efficient and that full contribution is socially optimal, as evidenced by their repeated willingness to match a high-contribution environment. At the same time, they are clearly attentive to payoff differences and are willing to trade off social efficiency for personal gain when it looks safe to do so. This indicates a blend of cooperative preference and self-interested optimization rather than pure altruism or pure free-riding.\n\nFairness norms seem conditional and asymmetric. The player is willing to contribute fully for long stretches even when an isolated peer defects, suggesting a tolerance for some level of unfairness or a focus on maintaining group output over immediate reciprocity. However, when the group remains very cooperative, they sometimes drop their own contribution sharply while others keep contributing at or near the maximum. In those moments they violate strict equality norms in their own favor, implying that fairness is not a dominant motive when it conflicts strongly with personal payoff.\n\nThey show some responsiveness to visible defections but not in a purely retaliatory way. Isolated low contributions by others do not reliably trigger immediate punishment via their own defection; instead, the player continues to contribute highly through several such events and only occasionally reduces their own contribution later. This delayed and inconsistent adjustment suggests exploratory or profit-maximizing tinkering rather than emotionally driven reciprocity.\n\nRisk tolerance appears moderate. The player is willing to risk being the lone free-rider in an otherwise cooperative group in order to earn high payoffs, which involves reputational or moral risk in many PGG contexts (even though no sanctions are available here). Yet they do not persistently defect; they revert frequently to full contributions, indicating caution about undermining the group’s cooperative equilibrium and the resulting efficiency loss. Overall, their persona fits a “strategic conditional cooperator with opportunistic leanings”: someone who prefers and sustains high cooperation but intermittently exploits it when they see a chance to personally gain without immediately collapsing the group’s contributions."

Their default pattern is to give the full endowment whenever group cooperation appears strong or quickly recovers after small deviations. They contribute consistently rather than gradually adjusting, suggesting a rule-based approach rather than fine-grained payoff optimization.\n\nDeviations from full contribution are infrequent and come in two forms: rare complete withdrawals and a single moderate reduction. These occur while others still contribute substantially, indicating deliberate tests of how much they can exploit group cooperation without collapsing it, rather than reactive punishment or resignation. After each exploitative move, they revert to full contribution once it is clear others remain cooperative.\n\nThey appear comfortable earning slightly less in the short run to sustain a highly cooperative environment most of the time, but they also opportunistically capture extra payoff when they expect the group to hold together without their help. Their behavior is conditional on perceived group norms: as long as the majority continues to give close to the maximum, they maintain full contributions, even when one or two players chronically lag or fluctuate. Attempts by others to reduce contributions do not trigger a downward spiral from this player; they instead recommit to full cooperation, apparently prioritizing group-level efficiency over retaliatory adjustment.\n\nOverall, they combine a strong cooperative norm with calculated, low-frequency defection, resembling a “principled conditional cooperator with opportunistic tests.” They seem to accept some inequality in their disfavor (contributing fully when others give slightly less) as long as the cooperative equilibrium remains intact, and use occasional free-riding primarily as an information-gathering or profit-maximizing tactic rather than as a new standard. Their risk tolerance is moderate: they are willing to risk small drops in group contributions to test defection, but they quickly stabilize back to maximal giving rather than escalating volatility."

This pattern suggests they primarily prioritize personal payoff over efficiency or equality, only temporarily deviating from that to test or experience more cooperative outcomes.\n\nTheir behavior is highly conditional on others’ actions in a narrow, self-focused way: they appear to take others’ unwavering full contributions as an exploitable resource rather than as a norm to reciprocate. However, the fact that they do sometimes make large contributions indicates they are not a pure, rigid free-rider. Instead, they seem capable of experimenting with higher contributions, perhaps to see the payoff consequences or to gauge how the mechanism works, but they do not sustain such behavior.\n\nThere is no indication that they are aiming at fairness in the sense of matching others’ contributions or equalizing payoffs. They consistently benefit from others’ generosity without reciprocating in a stable way. This suggests a weak or absent internal fairness norm within the game context, at least behaviorally. If any fairness concern exists, it does not override their inclination to exploit the cooperative environment.\n\nTheir risk tolerance appears moderate to low: once they see that others contribute maximally and that they can safely free-ride, they largely stick to the safe, high-private-payoff strategy, with only a couple of higher-contribution deviations that look more exploratory than risk-seeking for social reasons. They do not appear to fear retaliation or breakdown of cooperation, possibly because no punishment is available and others’ behavior remains perfectly stable.\n\nOverall, their contribution pattern is stable in its free-riding core but punctuated by a small number of sizable, short-lived cooperative moves, which look like tests or curiosity-driven changes rather than commitment to a cooperative norm.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThe player shows awareness of the game horizon but does not use it to gradually reduce cooperation; instead, they maintain a predominantly free-riding strategy throughout and briefly escalate cooperation before returning to free-riding at the very end. There is no classic pattern of declining contributions as the end approaches, because sustained cooperation is never really established from their side.\n\nIn the late phase, they temporarily switch to high contributions and then abruptly revert to giving nothing on the final decision. This suggests that, when the end is clearly in sight, they still prioritize their own last-round payoff over any desire to maintain a cooperative pattern. The final move is consistent with end-game defection logic: with no future interaction, they feel no incentive to continue contributing.\n\nTheir brief late-game cooperative surge does not translate into a “cooperation ramp” or a stable end-game strategy. Instead, it looks like a short experiment that they quickly abandon when it directly conflicts with maximizing their final payoff. There is no behavioral sign that they are motivated to leave a “good impression” or end on a prosocial note; the terminal choice is self-serving and aligns with their broader opportunistic type."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a strategically flexible, profit-focused conditional cooperator with moderate volatility in contributions. They rarely anchor on a fixed level; instead they adjust contributions across the full range from zero to the maximum. Their default tendency is not purely selfish or purely altruistic: they sometimes contribute substantial amounts, sometimes nothing, and frequently choose small to moderate contributions.\n\nThey condition their behavior on observed group cooperation but in a highly asymmetric way. When others contribute very little, they are willing to reduce their own contributions sharply down to near-zero, indicating low tolerance for being the “sucker.” When others contribute a lot, they sometimes reciprocate with high or moderate cooperation, but they also repeatedly exploit such situations by free-riding or near–free-riding while still enjoying the public good. This indicates that their fairness norms are weakly enforced from their own side: they are sensitive to being treated unfairly, but are comfortable benefiting from others’ generosity.\n\nTheir pattern suggests they are attentive to payoff consequences and the high multiplier, but they prioritize maximizing their own earnings over sustaining a norm of full cooperation. They experiment with low, medium, and high contributions, and appear willing to switch quickly between them as beliefs about others’ behavior change. Volatility is thus purposeful rather than random: they use contribution changes as an adaptive response rather than settling into a stable cooperative identity.\n\nThey exhibit moderate risk tolerance. They take some risks by occasionally contributing high amounts when others appear cooperative, but they are quicker to drop contributions than to increase them when outcomes seem less favorable. They show no clear evidence of long-run commitment to cooperation; instead, they use the public good instrumentally, increasing contributions when they expect strong returns and cutting back when they perceive diminishing marginal benefit or rising exploitation risk. Overall, they are best characterized as an opportunistic conditional cooperator who oscillates between cooperative and free-riding behavior depending on immediate incentives and recent group contributions."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a high, but not unconditional, contributor who oscillates between full cooperation and pure free-riding rather than using intermediate or mixed levels (which are not available in this game). Their default appears to be full contribution: across the interaction they more often choose to contribute than not, including in several situations where others do not fully match their cooperation. They do not immediately switch to permanent defection when encountering low contributions; instead, they continue to cooperate in multiple later opportunities even after experiencing profitable free-riding and periods of weak group cooperation. This suggests a cooperative orientation that is resilient, but not rigid.\n\nStability is moderate: the player’s pattern alternates between stretches of full contribution and occasional zero-contribution “tests” or opportunistic turns. These zero contributions tend to occur after they have recently seen that others are willing to contribute, indicating conditionality: they are more willing to free-ride once the group has demonstrated cooperative tendencies, and less willing to defect when others have just been uncooperative. However, they do not implement a simple “mirror” or tit-for-tat rule; they sometimes continue to contribute even when others’ contributions are low, implying that they tolerate some level of unfairness or noise before abandoning cooperation.\n\nTheir behavior reflects an awareness of payoff structure and a willingness to exploit beneficial situations. When the environment is cooperative, they sometimes take advantage by contributing nothing while still benefiting from others’ inputs. Yet they return to contributing afterward, which suggests that they are not purely payoff-maximizing in a narrow, short-term sense. Instead, they appear to trade off between personal gain and sustaining a cooperative environment, tolerating some personal disadvantage at times and taking advantage at others.\n\nOn fairness norms, the player appears flexible and somewhat self-serving. They do not insist on strict equality of effort: they continue to contribute fully even when they are doing more than some partners, and they allow themselves to free-ride when others do more. This points to a “lenient but opportunistic” fairness standard—cooperation is good and often worth maintaining, but exploiting clear opportunities for higher payoff is acceptable, especially once others have shown cooperativeness.\n\nRisk tolerance appears moderate to high. Since the marginal per-capita return is above the individual return from keeping the endowment, full contribution is individually risky only in the sense that others may not reciprocate. The player repeatedly chooses cooperation even after seeing that the group is not always fully cooperative, implying comfort with the risk that others might defect and reduce their payoff. At the same time, intermittent defection shows that they manage downside risk by occasionally securing guaranteed higher private payoffs when the group is cooperative enough to sustain it. Overall, they behave as a conditional cooperator with opportunistic free-riding tendencies, willing to accept some risk and some inequity to pursue both cooperation and profit."

They use only the extreme options (all or nothing) and switch multiple times rather than locking into a stable pattern.

They also exploit highly cooperative phases by free-riding, taking the entire endowment while others continue to contribute, indicating a readiness to prioritize personal payoff over strict fairness.\n\nTheir contributions are clearly conditional on recent group behavior: they tend to increase or maintain high contributions when they see widespread or unanimous cooperation, and they are more likely to drop to zero when cooperation looks spotty, uneven, or declining. However, they do not strictly punish defectors by defecting in every mixed situation; they sometimes continue to contribute despite seeing non-cooperation from at least one peer, suggesting some tolerance for partial free-riding or a hope that ongoing cooperation will stabilize or resume.\n\nFairness norms appear flexible. The player sometimes accepts an outcome where they pay more than at least one other group member and keeps contributing, which points to either a weak inequality aversion or a belief that maintaining group returns is more important than immediate payoff parity. At other times, they opportunistically free-ride when others are fully cooperative, implying they are comfortable benefiting from others’ contributions when the opportunity is salient.\n\nThey demonstrate some risk tolerance around cooperation: they are willing to invest everything into the public fund even when it is not guaranteed that everyone else will do the same, but they also hedge by reverting to defection after disappointing returns or low group contributions. Across the game, this produces a persona that is neither a pure cooperator nor a pure defector, but a payoff-sensitive, adaptive contributor who oscillates between full cooperation and full defection in response to perceived group norms and recent payoffs."

They repeatedly choose the cooperative action even after experiencing low personal payoffs from being more generous than at least one other group member, indicating a relatively high tolerance for short-run disadvantage and some commitment to group-beneficial outcomes.\n\nTheir contribution pattern shows both stability and targeted volatility:\n\n- Over the game, they use both extremes of the action space (all or nothing), never intermediate amounts (which are not available here), and they use both options multiple times. This suggests they think in discrete strategic categories: “cooperate fully” vs “defect fully,” rather than trying to finely tune contributions.\n- For extended stretches, they maintain full contributions despite mixed or imperfect cooperation from others, suggesting a baseline inclination toward cooperation and a willingness to test whether cooperative norms can be sustained.\n- They occasionally switch to full free-riding in contexts where others are contributing well or resume contributing after a collective breakdown, indicating they are attentive to payoff structure and group dynamics rather than being purely rule-following or purely selfish.\n\nTheir behavior is clearly conditional: they respond to the composition of others’ contributions and to recent patterns rather than following a fixed rule. When others are consistently cooperative, they are generally cooperative too, but they also occasionally exploit those cooperative phases by free-riding.

However, they do not behave as a strict fairness enforcer or unconditional altruist: they are willing to capitalize on cooperative others by defecting when it is clearly profitable, and they do not refuse such gains. Their fairness norm is thus flexible and context-sensitive rather than rigid.\n\nRisk-wise, they accept the risk of cooperating in uncertain environments and tolerate being exposed to exploitation for multiple periods. At the same time, their selective free-riding shows that, when evidence accumulates that cooperation is fragile or exploitable, they are willing to reduce that risk and protect their own payoff. Overall, they act as a moderately risk-tolerant, payoff-aware conditional cooperator who balances social and self-interested motives, rather than as an extreme altruist or a purely outcome-maximizing defector."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is mostly a high contributor who aligns with the group’s cooperation norm but intermittently deviates to free-ride or to send a signal. Across the game, they choose the maximum contribution in the majority of rounds and seem comfortable with the efficient, fully cooperative outcome when others also contribute. Their pattern is not strictly stable: they occasionally contribute nothing in otherwise cooperative environments, suggesting willingness to exploit the public good at times or to express frustration via non-contribution.\n\nTheir deviations from full contribution appear conditional, not random. When another player systematically under-contributes, they sometimes respond by also withholding their own contribution and by escalating punishment. This indicates a fairness-oriented conditional strategy: they prefer mutual full contribution but are willing to sacrifice efficiency to punish or protest against perceived free-riding.\n\nThey appear to understand the payoff structure at least at a basic, behavioral level: they repeatedly return to full contribution after episodes of conflict, and they maintain full contribution throughout many cooperative stretches, implying they perceive that mutual cooperation is profitable. Risk tolerance seems moderate: they invest heavily in punishment at times, absorbing substantial short-term payoffs losses, but they otherwise play a fairly straightforward cooperative strategy rather than trying intricate exploitation patterns.\n\nOverall, they fit a “conditional cooperator with punitive streak” type: they default to maximal contribution when others appear cooperative but are willing to suspend cooperation when angered by persistent defection or when trying to discipline an outlier.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThe player engages in light, somewhat sarcastic conversation and is socially responsive rather than withdrawn. Early on, they verbally endorse the group proposal to all contribute fully and accept the cooperative norm set by others. Their tone ranges from casual and humorous to mildly hostile when criticizing an apparent free-rider, showing that they use chat both for social bonding and for social sanctioning.\n\nThey do not lead coordination or provide detailed instructions; instead, they follow others’ coordination attempts and occasionally comment on others’ behavior or the avatars. Their explanation about having “pressed the wrong button” after being praised for punishment reads more like a face-saving or humorous remark than a serious claim of confusion, given that their actual contribution pattern is already largely cooperative. This suggests they occasionally manage impressions or downplay their own intentional deviations.\n\nThey respond when spoken to and acknowledge group dynamics, but they do not actively negotiate complex strategies, monetary calculations, or long-term plans. Their communication style is engaged but not dominant, emotionally expressive but not fully confrontational, and aligned with maintaining a cooperative group identity with some playful antagonism toward defectors.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThere is no clear evidence of a strong end-game unraveling in their contributions. They continue to choose the maximum contribution in most of the later rounds and do not show a monotonic decline as the game approaches its final stages. Instances of zero contribution later in the game coincide with broader breakdowns in group cooperation, not specifically with the known horizon.\n\nThey appear aware of the structure (rounds are numbered and discussed by others), but their behavior does not show a systematic “it’s almost over, so I defect” strategy. Instead, their late-game choices oscillate with group behavior: they defect in one late round during a wider collapse in contributions and return to full contribution once cooperation resumes. Their final round behavior remains cooperative even though the incentive to defect is highest, suggesting either a stable internal norm for contributing or continued desire to align with the cooperative majority more than a horizon-focused payoff maximization.\n\nGiven the limited direct evidence, their horizon awareness is unknown, but their behavior is more consistent with norm-following than with calculated end-game exploitation.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThe player is a frequent and heavy user of punishment, willing to incur large personal costs to sanction perceived free-riders. They do not punish indiscriminately across all rounds: their punishment expenditures cluster around periods when one or more players visibly contribute nothing while the rest of the group cooperates. This timing suggests that punishment is primarily triggered by norm violations (under-contribution relative to the group), not by random aggression.\n\nThey are willing to target at least one focal low contributor intensely, investing enough coins into punishment to significantly reduce their own payoffs. This indicates that, at times, they prioritize enforcing fairness or expressing disapproval over immediate monetary gain. When group cooperation breaks down more broadly and multiple players start contributing nothing, their punishment intensity drops to zero, even though opportunities for punishment remain. That pattern is consistent with a deterrence goal: when there is no longer a clear cooperative norm or deviant minority, punishing becomes less meaningful to them.\n\nRetaliatory motives cannot be ruled out—this player is themselves punished in some of the same episodes in which they use heavy punishment, and the mutual deductions may reflect tit-for-tat dynamics. However, the structure of their punishment (focusing on contributors who are consistently at zero when others are cooperative) is more aligned with norm-enforcement than with blind revenge. They thus fit a “strong norm enforcer” type who uses punishment aggressively when they see a single or small set of deviants in an otherwise cooperative group and largely refrains once norms collapse.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nThe player receives nontrivial punishment in several rounds, including ones where they themselves deviate from full contribution. Their observable reaction is mixed: on the one hand, they do not engage in overt verbal retaliation against specific punishers and do not name or accuse them in chat. On the other hand, they continue to punish heavily even while being punished, indicating that they do not back down in response to sanctions and do not immediately shift to a more conciliatory, cooperative posture toward those who punish them.\n\nThey briefly offer a humorous or face-saving explanation about “pressing the wrong button” after another player praises their punitive actions. This remark comes after a period where they both deviated from the contribution norm and used strong punishment, and after they had been punished themselves. This suggests that when confronted socially with their behavior, they prefer to diffuse tension with humor or plausible deniability rather than directly admit exploitative or spiteful intent.\n\nThey do not appear to systematically retaliate directly against punishers as punishers; instead, their punishment pattern stays tied to contribution behavior, not to who punished them. Compliance with norms after being punished is partial: they return to full contribution in many subsequent rounds, but this also coincides with a reestablishment of group cooperation, so it is unclear whether they are responding to punishment, group expectations, or their own preferences. Overall, they show a combination of stubbornness (continuing to use punishment despite being punished) and social smoothing (joking explanations) rather than clear submissive compliance or vindictive counter-punishment."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a strongly cooperative, norm-focused contributor who usually gives the full endowment to the public fund. Their default is to maintain very high contributions even as others occasionally lower theirs. They only reduce their own contribution a few times, and those reductions are modest relative to full free-riding, suggesting discomfort with deviating too far from a fairness norm rather than a shift to pure self-interest.\n\nTheir cooperation is conditionally tied to perceived group norms rather than to short-term payoff maximization: they continue to contribute fully even when average contributions dip and when they personally suffer substantial punishment. They do not appear to condition contributions strongly on having received rewards or punishments; contribution levels are remarkably stable despite large shocks. This points to a principled, rule-based cooperation style rather than responsive tit-for-tat.\n\nThey show mild willingness to shade contributions downward when group averages and some individual contributions fall, but they never exploit very low-contributing peers to take large private gains. Risk tolerance appears moderate: they accept repeated exposure to potential punishment rather than reshaping their contribution behavior to avoid being targeted, implying either confidence that their high contributions are justified or relative indifference to strategic image management via contribution choices alone.\n\nFairness norms are strict and demanding: they seem to view full or near-full contribution as the proper standard for others, and they keep adhering to that themselves even when others deviate. They appear more willing to use the punishment mechanism to enforce norms than to use their own contributions as leverage.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nAwareness of the finite horizon does not produce a classic end-game unraveling in this player. They maintain full contributions through the final rounds, including the last one, showing no systematic cooperation decay. Instead of cutting contributions as the end approaches, they escalate enforcement via punishment. Near the end, they dramatically increase the intensity of sanctions on certain targets while still contributing fully.\n\nThis pattern suggests that they treat the final rounds as an opportunity to “settle accounts” or reinforce norms rather than to exploit others. They do not appear to adopt a backward-induction logic that would lead to selfish behavior as the game ends. If anything, they become more aggressive in disciplining those they see as repeated norm violators, using the end game to deliver large, possibly symbolic punishments. Overall, horizon awareness changes their punishment strategy more than their contribution level.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThe player is highly willing to incur substantial personal costs to punish others, especially repeat or extreme under-contributors relative to a high-contribution norm. They frequently target specific individuals who persistently contribute less than what the player seems to regard as acceptable. Targets are not random: they focus on those who deviate downward from an implicit full-contribution standard and who do so repeatedly over time.\n\nThey distinguish between moderate and severe norm violations. When another player contributes somewhat below the apparent norm, they often apply mild, repeated punishment, suggesting an attempt at calibrated deterrence. When a peer contributes very little or zero, especially if this happens multiple times, the player escalates to very large punishment expenditures. This escalation shows a strong “strong reciprocator” or altruistic-punisher tendency: they are willing to sacrifice significant payoff to impose very large costs on defectors.\n\nTheir punishment is primarily norm-enforcing rather than payoff-optimizing. They continue to punish even when the marginal effectiveness of punishment is uncertain and when punishment is extremely expensive for them. They also maintain high contributions while punishing, which indicates that the motive is not simply to reduce defectors’ relative advantage but to enforce a cooperative standard.\n\nSelectivity is clear: they usually ignore small, one-off deviations and instead concentrate on a few players whose contributions repeatedly fall short or who oscillate between compliance and mild defection. This suggests they track histories and are sensitive to patterns over time. There are a few instances where they punish a player who has not clearly defected recently, indicating either low tolerance for any earlier deviation, a delayed response to past rounds, or possible confusion about recent contribution histories; confidence in this interpretation is low.\n\nThey do not appear to punish for personal retaliation against those who punish them: when they themselves are targeted, there is no clear, immediate counter-punishment against the likely punisher. Their punishment behavior therefore looks more like impersonal norm enforcement than vendetta.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nWhen the player is punished, they do not obviously retaliate through counter-punishment, nor do they significantly reduce their own contributions in response. Their behavior after being punished stays highly cooperative and norm-enforcing, and they continue to direct sanctions at third-party under-contributors rather than at whoever targeted them.\n\nBecause punishers are identifiable, the absence of clear counter-punishment suggests that they either: (a) interpret punishment of themselves as a possible mistake or as noise; (b) prioritize group-level norm enforcement over personal revenge; or (c) do not track or respond to individual-level hostility in a tit-for-tat manner. They also do not show evidence of “compliance” in the sense of changing their strategy to align with a punisher’s apparent preferences; instead they persist with their own high-contribution, high-punishment strategy.\n\nOverall, they appear relatively forgiving or at least non-retaliatory toward punishers, and they show a strong commitment to their own normative rule-set despite receiving negative feedback. Precise beliefs about why they were punished are unknown.\n\n<REWARD>\nThe player shows very low usage of the reward mechanism. They reward a high contributor once early in the game but then almost never spend on rewards again, despite frequent observation of others who also cooperate at high levels. They do not systematically reward consistent high contributors or those who increase their contributions after punishment episodes. Rewarding behavior is therefore rare, unsustained, and not clearly part of a stable strategy.\n\nGiven that rewarding is institutionally inefficient (costly to the rewarder and relatively weak in effect), their strong preference for punishment over reward suggests they see negative sanctions as the primary tool for shaping behavior, rather than positive reinforcement. They prioritize punishing defectors over supporting cooperators, even when the group is already relatively cooperative. This implies a “stick over carrot” enforcement style, with rewards, when used, serving at most as occasional, perhaps exploratory, signals rather than a core component of their strategy.\n\nTheir single clear reward instance targets a high-contributing peer, suggesting they conceptually link reward to exceptional cooperation, but the fact that they do not repeat this pattern later indicates they either deem it too costly or too ineffective, or they focus so heavily on defectors that they choose not to allocate resources to rewarding.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nWhen the player is rewarded, they maintain or resume high contributions, but since high contributions are already their default, it is unclear whether the reward causally affects their behavior. There is no discernible attempt to reciprocate directly to the rewarder via counter-reward, nor do they appear to form a special “alliance” or favor network in response.\n\nThey also do not lower punishment of under-contributors after being rewarded; their norm-enforcement style persists unchanged, and they continue to sanction defectors aggressively. This suggests that, while they may appreciate being recognized (unknown), they do not update their broader enforcement or contribution strategies in a visible way because of rewards. Reciprocity toward rewarders is either absent or too subtle to detect in this data.\n\nOverall, the player behaves as a principled, high-contribution enforcer type: they anchor on a strict cooperation norm, maintain it across the entire game, and rely heavily on costly punishment—rather than reward, retaliation, or end-game defection—to manage the social environment."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a conditional, profit-focused free-rider with intermittent cooperative “bursts.” They treat contribution as a tool rather than a norm. Across the game, they spend a meaningful but minority share of their rounds contributing fully, alternating between full contribution and full defection rather than mixing intermediate amounts (here, a binary choice).\n\nTheir baseline preference is to keep their endowment and live off others’ contributions. When others’ cooperation remains reasonably high without their help, they comfortably defect and accept the group benefit. They do not systematically match others’ behavior: they sometimes contribute fully in environments where free-riding would be clearly more profitable, and sometimes defect in moderately cooperative environments. This suggests they are not following a simple “contribute if enough others do” rule; instead, they appear to explore and periodically test how much cooperation they can induce or sustain, then revert to self-interest.\n\nThey do not display a rigid fairness norm. They are willing to contribute fully even when several peers free-ride, and also willing to free-ride when many peers contribute. This indicates they do not insist on contribution reciprocity before they contribute, nor do they insist on “no one should gain more than me” as a stable rule. Their behavior is better described as opportunistic and adaptive: they are sensitive to the payoff structure and willing to accept payoff inequality if it advantages them.\n\nRisk tolerance appears moderate. They sometimes choose the payoff-dominated cooperative action in environments where cooperation is fragile, which is risky if others defect, yet they never push this to an extreme sustained costly-cooperator pattern. They are not an unconditional cooperator or unconditional defector; instead, they oscillate, suggesting active learning and occasional risk-taking within an overall payoff-oriented frame.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThe player shows awareness of the horizon and gradually shifts toward more consistent free-riding as the game progresses, but does not switch to pure defection. In the final stretch, contributions become rarer and are interspersed with defection even when cooperation by others is still present. The last round itself is played as a free-rider, consistent with standard end-game unraveling logic.\n\nHowever, they do not exhibit a sharp, one-time end-game collapse. Rather, they move in and out of cooperative choices in late rounds, including at least one late cooperative burst despite the short remaining horizon. This suggests they understand that the game is finite and lean more toward self-interest near the end, but they also keep open the possibility of maintaining or exploiting a cooperative environment even late if it seems profitable or strategically interesting.\n\nThere is no clear evidence they are trying to build a reputation for future interactions beyond this game; with punishers being identifiable but no future interaction guaranteed after the final round, they do not make extra cooperative “gestures” at the end. Overall, they show partial end-game decay of cooperation, but not a strict backward-induction style collapse.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThis player is willing to punish and at times punishes quite heavily relative to their own payoff, but only in a subset of cooperative rounds. They never punish when they themselves defect; all observed punishment occurs when they are cooperating. This is consistent with a norm-enforcing or frustration-driven pattern: they are more likely to punish when they perceive themselves as “doing their part” and others not following suit.\n\nTheir punishment is not continuous or automatic. They sometimes cooperate in the presence of clear free-riders and do not punish at all, and at other times, in similarly mixed environments, they invest substantial resources into punishment. This inconsistency suggests that punishment is not governed by a strict threshold rule (e.g., “punish all defectors”); instead, it may be driven by situational emotion, salience of low contributors, or occasional attempts to reset group norms.\n\nPunishment episodes are sizable relative to their own income in those rounds, indicating they are at least temporarily willing to trade off personal payoff to sanction others. Because we do not observe the distribution of their punishment across specific peers, their selectivity toward particular individuals is unknown. However, the fact that they never punish while defecting themselves argues against “pure spite” or random aggression; they appear to reserve costly sanctions for situations in which they see themselves as justified enforcers rather than simultaneous free-riders.\n\nGiven that punishment is identifiable, they must anticipate possible retaliation, yet they still engage in it on multiple occasions. This implies either a taste for norm-enforcement or a belief that the deterrence/teaching effect outweighs the risk of being punished back. Whether their punishment actually changes others’ contributions is unknown.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nThe player is punished multiple times across the game, including in some rounds where they cooperate and some where they defect. Their response to being punished does not show clear compliance or clear retaliation.\n\nThey do not reliably increase contributions after being punished; in some cases, they subsequently defect, and in others they later cooperate again under different conditions. Thus, punishment does not lock them into cooperation. At the same time, they do not exhibit obvious counter-punishment patterns: they never punish in rounds where they are defecting, and they do not increase their use of punishment immediately after receiving deductions in a way that would clearly signal revenge. Because the identity of their punishers is not provided in the transcript, whether they specifically target those individuals is unknown and confidence in any retaliation inference is low.\n\nMore broadly, the player appears relatively thick-skinned regarding punishment. They continue to free-ride in later rounds despite having been sanctioned earlier, indicating they are not easily cowed into permanent cooperative compliance. Nor do they abandon cooperation entirely after being punished while cooperating; they still choose full contribution in later rounds. This suggests a pragmatic stance: punishment is treated as one data point in a noisy environment rather than a binding signal to change strategy.\n\nOverall, their response to punishers mixes partial disregard (they keep defecting when profitable) with occasional cooperative choices that are not tightly coupled to prior sanctions. They neither strongly appease nor systematically retaliate; instead, they maintain their opportunistic, mixed strategy largely independent of who has punished them before."

Their cooperation does not appear contingent on others’ behavior: they continue to contribute fully when some players give nothing, and also when everyone cooperates. They show no visible attempt to fine-tune contributions in response to individual defectors, instead treating contribution as a fixed norm. This suggests a strong intrinsic or norm-based preference for full cooperation rather than payoff-maximizing calculus. Risk tolerance appears high regarding potential exploitation: they persist with full contributions despite repeated evidence that at least one player is free riding and sometimes being rewarded overall. Fairness norms are present but are not expressed through adjusting their own contribution level; instead, fairness concerns show up in their initial punishment choice (see below) rather than in withholding contributions.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThe player never sends any chat messages. They neither initiate coordination nor respond verbally to others’ attempts at persuasion, humor, or social bonding. They are completely silent despite an active, social, and sometimes playful group chat environment. This is consistent with a highly task-focused or low-engagement communication style. They may be strategically “quiet cooperative”: participating through actions only, letting contribution and sanctioning speak for itself. There is no evidence of explicit norm signaling, emotional expression, or alliance-building through chat. Their non-participation in jokes and meta-discussion suggests either disinterest, deliberate neutrality, or a preference to avoid social influence or conflict in communication channels. Overall, they are behaviorally engaged but socially silent.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThe player’s cooperative strategy shows no end-game decay. They maintain full contributions through the final rounds, even when it is common-knowledge that the game is about to end. They do not appear to shift into selfish extraction near the end, and they also do not suddenly intensify use of punishment or reward as the horizon approaches. Their pattern of not using sanctions after the first period continues unchanged into the last period. This indicates that their cooperation is not driven primarily by long-term reciprocity or future-oriented incentives; instead, they behave as if full contribution is the appropriate action regardless of remaining rounds. Awareness of the horizon is given in the interface, but there is no behavioral sign that they strategically respond to it.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey punish only once and very heavily, targeting a player who contributed fully but was already being massively punished by others. They spend a substantial amount of their own payoff to further increase that player’s deductions. After this, they never punish again, even though several players later contribute nothing in multiple rounds. This single, early, high-intensity punishment is not obviously efficiency-oriented: the target is not a low contributor in that round, and the marginal deterrent value of further punishment is arguably low given the already extreme level imposed by others. The behavior fits a “bandwagon” or “pile-on” pattern: joining a collective punishment episode rather than independently evaluating contribution behavior that round. There is no evidence of targeted, proportional sanctioning tied strictly to current free riding; instead, the one observed punishment is extreme, socially aligned with others’ hostility to the same player, and then discontinued entirely. After this event, they seem to refrain from all further punitive action, even when future behavior (e.g., zero contributions by several players) would provide clear justifications under standard conditional-cooperation norms. Their punishment style is thus: highly willing to spend a lot in an initial social-punishment cascade, but not systematically enforcing norms thereafter. Motivation is ambiguous; it could be driven by early affect/identity cues from chat (others labeling someone negatively) rather than strictly by current contribution levels. Confidence on the exact motive is low.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nThey are never punished in the transcript. Consequently, their response to being punished is unknown. There is no evidence on whether they would retaliate, comply by changing contributions, or ignore sanctions if they occurred.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey never allocate rewards to anyone, despite many players contributing fully and some others using reward as positive reinforcement. They forgo low-cost opportunities to strengthen cooperation or reciprocate kindness through the reward channel, even when they themselves receive rewards. This consistent non-use of rewards suggests they either do not value the reward mechanism, prefer to conserve coins once the initial punishment burst is over, or treat contributions as self-sufficient signals that do not require extra reinforcement. There is no selective rewarding of high contributors, no alliance-like reward patterns, and no final-round “thank you” rewarding. The absence of any reward behavior contrasts with their early willingness to spend heavily on punishment, pointing toward a sanctioning style that is skewed (when active) toward negative rather than positive incentives.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThey receive small rewards in at least some rounds from several others, but they never reciprocate via rewards. They also do not shift their sanction behavior in favor of those who rewarded them, nor do they start rewarding cooperators more generally. Their contribution behavior remains unchanged (always full), and their punishment/reward behavior remains minimal after the first round. This indicates that they do not use the reward channel for reciprocity or alliance building, at least within the observed game. Their response to being rewarded is essentially behavioral inertia: they keep cooperating but do not “pay back” through the same mechanism. Whether they feel gratitude privately is unknown; observable reciprocity in rewards is absent.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey see detailed information about others’ payoffs, punishment, and reward flows. Their one major behavioral response to others’ outcomes is joining an early, extreme collective punishment episode against a single player who ends with a large negative payoff due to group sanctions. They contribute to that outcome by adding significant punishment of their own. After that, they do not visibly react to later variations in others’ outcomes: they do not step in to punish later free riders or to support cooperators with rewards, even when others clearly spend on such actions. They also do not alter their own contributions in response to any pattern of outcomes; they keep contributing fully regardless of who is being rewarded or punished and how payoffs are distributed. This suggests that they attend to others’ outcomes enough to join a salient early punishment cascade but then settle into a “cooperate and ignore” stance where payoff heterogeneity and sanction patterns no longer drive their behavior. Their sensitivity to social information seems front-loaded and not dynamically updated across later rounds, or at least does not manifest in further strategic changes.\n\n"

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a stable, unconditional high contributor. They always contribute the full endowment, never deviating even when some others contribute nothing or when free-riding is repeatedly visible. Their behavior aligns with a strong efficiency and cooperation norm: they appear to prioritize maximizing the group return over exploiting others. They show no evidence of conditional cooperation (they do not scale contributions down in response to defectors, nor up relative to others); instead they follow a simple “always all-in” rule. They seem comfortable bearing the risk of being exploited by low contributors and do not attempt to hedge against defection. Fairness concerns, if present, do not translate into adjusting contributions; they rely on other mechanisms (chiefly social norms and possibly punishment by others) to handle unfairness rather than altering their own cooperative stance.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nTheir communication is sparse, light, and affiliative rather than strategic. They greet others implicitly by joining in with the group’s “all in” norm and later explicitly endorse that norm with a brief statement supporting full contributions every time. They also participate in the playful “we are robots” banter with a humorous remark, signaling sociability and a desire to fit into the group mood rather than to lead or criticize. They do not directly confront low contributors or direct others to punish or reward; instead they echo the cooperative consensus that has already formed. They do not initiate substantive coordination about punishment or rewards, and they avoid moralistic or aggressive language. Overall, they engage enough to be seen as part of the cooperative in-group, but they do not attempt to shape group strategy in a forceful or detailed way.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThey show no end-game decay in cooperation. Their contribution level remains at the maximum right through the final round, even as the horizon becomes short and others continue to free-ride intermittently. They do not switch to opportunistic behavior despite having no future rounds in which to rebuild reputation or benefit from reciprocity. There is no evidence that they try to exploit last-round anonymity or to recoup earlier losses. This suggests either a rule-based or principled commitment to cooperation that is insensitive to the finite horizon, or at least a choice not to condition on it in practice. Their use of punishment and rewards does not intensify or strategically change at the end; after an early punishment they remain inactive in the sanctioning stage through the remainder of the game, including in the final round.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey punish exactly once, targeting a player who contributes fully in that period and has not clearly deviated in that round. The amount is minimal in the context of the game and is extremely small relative to the much larger punishment this target receives from others. The trigger for this punishment is ambiguous: it does not clearly correspond to immediate free-riding or to a contemporaneous breach of a cooperation norm. This makes the motive uncertain: it could be a mistaken click, a playful or bandwagon response to emerging hostility toward that player, or a weak expression of disapproval for prior noncooperative behavior. After this single act, they refrain from using punishment altogether, even when standard free-riding targets reappear and other players continue to punish them. They never engage in retaliatory punishment; they themselves are never punished, so their tolerance for personal provocation is unknown. Overall, they are best described as a very low-intensity, non-escalating punisher whose willingness to spend on punishment is limited and not clearly strategic.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nThey are never punished by any other player in the observed game, so their direct response to being punished is unknown. There is no evidence of preemptive appeasement or of retaliatory tendencies because they do not face any deductions. Their steady high contributions and non-use of late punishment suggest they are not trying to signal toughness or a readiness to retaliate, but this is inference with low confidence because no direct provocation occurs.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey never spend any resources on rewards. Even when others cooperate fully and some players reward them or other cooperators, they provide no positive reinforcement through the costly reward mechanism. This could reflect a preference to conserve payoff, skepticism about the efficacy of rewards, cognitive load/neglect of the reward option, or a belief that cooperation should be its own norm without needing side payments. Given that their contributions remain maximally cooperative, their lack of rewarding is not driven by selfish exploitation of others’ efforts, but rather by an apparent choice to rely on contribution behavior (and possibly group punishment) as the main cooperative device rather than spending additional coins on positive incentives.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThey receive a small reward from another player once. After that, they do not reciprocate with rewards to that player or to anyone else in subsequent rounds, nor do they change their contribution pattern (which was already fully cooperative). Their polite and humorous chat style suggests they are not hostile to the rewarder, but behaviorally they show no observable payoff-based reciprocity in the reward stage. They also do not publicly acknowledge or comment on having been rewarded, so any private feeling of gratitude is unobserved. In terms of observable strategy, they treat being rewarded as non-diagnostic: it does not alter their sanctioning decisions or their cooperative rule.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey appear relatively indifferent, behaviorally, to the detailed payoff and punishment/reward distributions of others. They see several cycles where specific low contributors are heavily punished by many players, and where some cooperators reward each other, yet they almost never join in sanctioning and never adjust their own contribution level. They do not speak up in chat to endorse or condemn the severity of punishment or the generosity of rewards, focusing instead on general cooperation slogans and light banter. They show no sign of targeting high earners, low earners, or heavy punishers/rewarders with any systematic pattern. The one early punishment they impose does not clearly track contemporaneous deviations, and they do not follow up on that target later even when that player’s outcomes remain salient. Overall, they attend enough to know that “all in” is good for the group and to participate in group identity talk, but they do not appear to engage in fine-grained tracking or management of others’ outcomes."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player fits a “strategic free-rider with intermittent reciprocity” type. They understand that the group return on contributions is high, and they are clearly *willing* to contribute fully, but only in selected moments and not as a stable norm.\n\nTheir contributions are highly volatile rather than consistent. They alternate between:\n- full contributions,\n- complete free-riding,\n- and occasional intermediate amounts.\n\nThey reliably contribute more when there is a current or recent norm of high contributions from others, and they frequently drop to zero when others are also contributing substantially. This pattern suggests conditional cooperation in *timing* (joining or sustaining cooperative phases) mixed with opportunistic exploitation once a cooperative environment is in place.\n\nThey do not display a simple “tit-for-tat” response to any single individual; instead, their behavior appears keyed to the *overall* contribution climate. They sometimes rejoin high cooperation even after having just exploited others, indicating they value group efficiency or fairness at least intermittently, but they are willing to accept being the main beneficiary of the public good when they see that others continue to contribute.\n\nThere is no evidence they are strongly fairness-driven in a strict, consistent sense; they tolerate repeatedly earning more than cooperative peers. At the same time, they are not a pure low-contributor type: they repeatedly take on personally costly, high contributions even when free-riding is available. This points to mixed motives: some concern for group welfare or norm-following, combined with strong payoff-seeking.\n\nRisk tolerance appears moderate: they are willing to be the high contributor even when some group members are clearly free-riding, which risks ending up exploited, but they also periodically hedge by keeping all their own endowment. The pattern looks more like strategic cycling than random noise.\n\nOverall, they are best modeled as a sophisticated conditional cooperator who opportunistically times free-riding rather than adhering to a principled cooperative rule.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nTheir communication is sparse, direct, and cooperative at the outset. They immediately endorse a full-contribution plan proposed by another player and do so without hedging or negotiation. This shows readiness to coordinate around an efficient, pro-social norm when prompted by others, but they do not take a leadership role in proposing norms themselves.\n\nAfter that brief agreement, they remain silent for the rest of the game. They do not defend, justify, or explain their later free-riding, nor do they confront others about low contributions. This suggests a low-engagement or low-disclosure style: they prefer to adapt silently rather than manage social impressions or argue about fairness.\n\nThey are clearly reading the chat (since they respond once early), but there is no evidence they try to persuade, shame, or rally people in later phases. Socially, they come across as understated and pragmatic rather than expressive. Their willingness to initially endorse “everyone contributes everything” alongside later quiet free-riding indicates they do not strongly internalize the social commitments expressed in chat, or they are comfortable deviating without explanation once conditions change.\n\nIn terms of tone, their single message is neutral and cooperative. There is no observable hostility, sarcasm, or moralizing; beyond the initial assent to a cooperative norm, their communication gives little signal about their personality or emotional state. Motivation and reasoning must be inferred primarily from their contribution behavior rather than their words.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThey show awareness of the finite horizon in a behavioral sense: near the end, they do not shift into a pure “endgame free-ride everything” strategy. Instead, they continue to use mixed contributions, including both low and high amounts, right up to the final decision.\n\nIn the closing phase, they at times free-ride while many others contribute heavily, and at other times they themselves contribute fully when others also do so. This indicates that their behavior is not driven solely by backwards induction logic or simple endgame unraveling. They do not display a clear monotonic decay of cooperation toward the end; if anything, they sustain or even revive high contributions in the last decision.\n\nThis pattern suggests:\n- They may not be strategically optimizing specifically for the very last round.\n- They may still care about maintaining or re-establishing a cooperative environment even when no future interaction is left.\n- Alternatively, they may simply be following the same conditional/mixed rule throughout, without giving special weight to the horizon.\n\nBecause they do not comment on the number of rounds or on upcoming termination, their explicit beliefs about the end-game are unknown. Behaviorally, though, they are not a classic “end-game defector”: they continue to cooperate substantially in the final decisions despite knowing the game is about to end.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey appear to closely observe others’ contributions and resulting payoffs, but they never verbalize any reaction to individual outcomes. They neither praise high contributors nor complain about free-riders. There is no direct social sanctioning or reward through words, and no mechanism exists in this game for monetary punishment or reward, so all their responses must be inferred from their own subsequent contribution choices.\n\nBehaviorally, they are comfortable allowing others to earn less while they profit from free-riding. When many others contribute high amounts and accept lower private payoffs, they do not move immediately to “correct” this inequality; instead, they often maintain or adopt zero contributions and enjoy the payoff advantage. This tolerance for asymmetric outcomes suggests that envy or guilt, if present, are not strong enough to override their opportunistic play.\n\nHowever, they also sometimes take on the role of high contributor when others are also investing heavily, even though they have previously seen that such generosity can lead to them earning less than free-riders. This indicates that they are not purely outcome-maximizing in a myopic sense; they are willing to join the cooperative set even after having observed its vulnerability to exploitation. They may believe that re-creating or sustaining a high-contribution environment is still worthwhile for overall group returns, or they may place some intrinsic value on “doing their part” under the right conditions.\n\nThere is no sign that they adjust contributions in a targeted way in response to any particular player’s payoff; their responses track the *aggregate* pattern of contributions and payoffs rather than focusing on specific individuals. Emotional reactions such as resentment, sympathy, or moral approval are not expressed in chat, so their inner attitudes toward others’ outcomes remain unknown. The safest inference is that they primarily treat others’ outcomes as information about how cooperative the environment is and whether it is currently profitable or safe for them to either contribute or free-ride."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a flexible, opportunistic contributor who frequently alternates between full contribution and full free-riding. They do not lock into a stable pattern: they sometimes join high-contribution environments and sometimes defect even when others contribute heavily. Their decisions are not purely selfish; they occasionally contribute when many others defect and also defect when others cooperate, suggesting that matching or fairness is not their primary rule. Instead, they appear to treat contribution as one tool among several for influencing group dynamics, not as a moral commitment.\n\nThey show no simple conditional rule like “I contribute if most others do” or “I contribute if I was punished.” They contribute in both cooperative and defect-heavy contexts, and they also free-ride in both. This indicates low adherence to a straightforward fairness norm such as strict conditional cooperation. Risk tolerance for social sanctions is moderate: they continue to alternate between contributing and defecting even when they are repeatedly punished, implying they accept or discount the risk of further sanctions rather than strictly complying.\n\nOverall, their contribution behavior fits an “experimenting enforcer” type: they treat their own contribution as secondary to their influence via punishment and reward, and they are willing to bear being seen as a defector at times.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nAwareness of the finite horizon does not lead to a simple end-game collapse or pure exploitation. In the final segment of the game they still mix contributions and defections and continue to use both costly punishment and reward, including in the very last round. They do not switch to purely selfish play or stop investing in social control when no future rounds remain, indicating that immediate material payoff is not their sole driver.\n\nThere is no visible trend toward systematically increasing or decreasing cooperation as the end approaches; instead, their pattern of alternating between contribution and free-riding persists. The continued willingness to spend on sanctions in the final rounds suggests they value expressing norms or “finishing the game right” over maximizing final-round income. This points to a stable preference for norm enforcement and signaling, rather than a strategy tightly optimized to the horizon.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThis player is a very heavy and frequent user of punishment. They impose sanctions in most rounds where the mechanism is available and often spend substantial amounts to do so. Their punishment is not narrowly focused on classic free-riders; they sometimes punish high contributors and sometimes punish defectors, and they target both frequent cooperators and frequent low contributors. This indicates that their criteria for punishment go beyond simple “punish non-contributors.”\n\nTheir targeting suggests several intertwined motives:\n\n- **Norm enforcement with a personal twist:** They regularly punish clear non-contributors who benefit from others’ cooperation, which is consistent with enforcing a contribution norm. At the same time, they also punish some cooperators and some players who appear neutral, which implies their norm is idiosyncratic, possibly based on a richer mental record of who has been “good” or “bad” earlier, including past punishment or reward decisions.\n\n- **Retaliation and score-settling:** They are themselves punished by multiple others, yet they persist in sanctioning those same players or their perceived allies. Because punishers are identifiable, the repetition of punishment against certain names, including some who have already been punished heavily by others, points to retaliatory or vindictive elements rather than purely forward-looking deterrence.\n\n- **Willingness to bear large costs:** They repeatedly spend on punishment even when it significantly reduces their own payoff in that round, and they do not stop doing so after experiencing large deductions from others. This shows a strong willingness to incur personal cost to impose harm, consistent with strong negative reciprocity and/or spite toward perceived norm violators.\n\nSelectivity is present but loose: they do not punish everyone, and they frequently pick out specific subsets of players each round. The pattern suggests they track reputations and use punishment both as a tool to express disapproval and as a way to “balance accounts,” rather than following a simple mechanical rule based only on current-round contributions.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nWhen punished, this player does not show clear compliance by aligning their behavior with punishers’ apparent preferences. Instead, they continue to alternate between contribution and free-riding and to use heavy punishment themselves. There is no consistent move toward safer, more conformist behavior after being targeted. This indicates low responsiveness to punishment as a deterrent and low deference to others’ attempts at control.\n\nThey also do not clearly stop punishing those who punish them; some of their punishment choices are consistent with retaliating against players who had previously imposed costs on them, but the mapping is not one-to-one and cannot be asserted with high confidence. Overall, however, their persistent and sometimes escalating sanctioning despite being hit themselves suggests they are not easily cowed and may even regard being punished as part of a conflict they are willing to continue.\n\nForgiveness versus grudges remains ambiguous. Because they both punish and reward many of the same players across time, it is unclear whether they actively forgive past punishers or simply follow a complex internal ledger that sometimes results in positive and sometimes in negative actions toward the same counterpart. Confidence in attributing a stable forgiving or unforgiving stance is low; the safest description is that they are not punishment-averse and do not visibly “back down” in response to being sanctioned.\n\n<REWARD>\nThis player is also a frequent and substantial user of reward, although less single-mindedly than punishment. They spend notable amounts to reward others across many rounds. Their rewards are directed both to high contributors and to some low contributors, and sometimes to players who are themselves frequent punishers or rewarders. This shows that their rewards are not purely based on current-round contribution levels.\n\nThe pattern suggests multiple motives:\n\n- **Positive reinforcement of perceived allies or behaviors:** They often reward players who appear cooperative or who may have treated them well (e.g., by rewarding them or refraining from punishing them). This points to conditional kindness: they use rewards to encourage or maintain alliances and to reinforce behaviors they like.\n\n- **Balancing and signaling:** They sometimes reward players who are simultaneously being heavily punished by others, and they occasionally reward players they themselves have punished in other rounds. This indicates that they use reward to fine-tune their stance toward individuals, signaling nuance (“I disapprove of some things, but I still credit you for others”) rather than treating punishment and reward as mutually exclusive.\n\n- **Low efficiency concern:** Given that here reward has much weaker leverage than punishment, a payoff-maximizer would use punishment for deterrence and rarely reward. This player nevertheless invests substantially in rewards, suggesting that they are motivated by expressive or relational concerns (gratitude, alliance-building, or fairness adjustments) more than by strict cost-benefit efficiency.\n\nOverall, their reward behavior is generous but strategic: they seem to maintain a mental map of who is “on their side” or promoting the kind of group they prefer and use rewards to support those players, even when the mechanism is relatively weak.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nWhen rewarded, this player does not exhibit a simple, consistent reciprocity rule, but there are hints of gratitude or alliance-building. They often reward players who themselves are active in the reward system, and they include frequent rewarders among their positive targets in later decisions. However, the evidence is not strong enough to claim a strict “I reward those who reward me” strategy; many of their reward and punishment choices do not map cleanly onto who has helped or hurt them most recently.\n\nThey do not clearly shift their contribution behavior upward in response to being rewarded, nor do they consistently protect rewarders from future punishment. This suggests that, while they may feel and express some gratitude, their internal ledger blends many factors (contribution history, punishment history, others’ treatment by the group) rather than simple direct reciprocity. Their response to being rewarded is therefore best described as partially reciprocal and relational, but noisy: they are open to alliances, yet they do not subordinate their broader norm-enforcement agenda to any one relationship.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThis player appears highly attentive to others’ contributions, payoffs, and sanctioning patterns. They adjust their punishment and reward targets in ways that reflect an active reading of who is currently being hurt, who is benefiting, and who is spending on sanctions. They sometimes support players who are otherwise being heavily punished by others, and they sometimes pile additional punishment onto players already under group pressure. This indicates that they track not only raw contributions but also social standing and recent treatment.\n\nThey often reward players whose outcomes suggest cooperation or costly generosity and punish those whose outcomes suggest repeated free-riding or aggressive sanctioning. However, because they sometimes sanction cooperators and reward low contributors, they are evidently using a more complex evaluation than “cooperation good, defection bad.” They may weigh perceived fairness across multiple rounds, viewing certain highly successful players as deserving of correction if their success is seen as coming at the group’s expense or through overuse of punishment.\n\nOverall, their reaction to others’ outcomes is that of an active, opinionated social accountant: they use the detailed feedback on contributions, sanctions, and payoffs to maintain a mental reputation system and to continually adjust who they punish or reward. They accept substantial personal cost to act on these judgments, prioritizing the expression and enforcement of their idiosyncratic norms over maximizing their own monetary outcome."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a high, near-unconditional cooperator. They almost always contribute the full endowment despite many free riders being present and despite frequent personal punishment. Defection is extremely rare and appears only in two isolated rounds, not as part of a trend. Their cooperation is only weakly conditional on others’ behavior: they continue to contribute when low contributors and zero contributors persist in the group, and when they themselves are targeted. They seem to follow a strong norm that “one should cooperate with the group” even when it is not payoff-maximizing. They tolerate substantial exploitation and do not attempt to protect themselves by systematically reducing contributions when others free ride. This pattern suggests a fairness or efficiency norm that prioritizes the public good over short-run personal gain, combined with high risk tolerance regarding being the “sucker” who contributes when others do not. They do not appear to be experimenting with contributions; their behavior is stable and rule-like rather than exploratory.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThe player remains cooperative through the final round. There is no clear contribution decay as the horizon approaches; instead, they continue to provide full contributions even when many others visibly defect late in the game and when they receive strong end-game punishment for defecting once. Their rare defections do not cluster strictly at the end; the last round returns to full cooperation. On the sanctioning side, they continue to use punishment and reward mechanisms late into the game, including targeted punishment in the final round, indicating they remain engaged in norm enforcement rather than “cashing out” or ceasing to invest in costly social control. This suggests they either discount the end-game structure or deliberately ignore backward-induction logic in favor of maintaining norms until the very end.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThe player is a frequent and targeted punisher. They consistently punish a persistent low contributor (PINGUIN) across many rounds, even when that player is heavily punished by others, indicating a strong anti-free-rider stance rather than a one-off reaction. They also punish another low-contributing player (CROCODILE) on selected occasions, particularly when that player combines low contributions with complex punishment/reward behavior toward others. Their punishment of high free riders is more systematic than their punishment of medium contributors; they do not punish cooperators, and they almost never punish ambiguous or borderline cases. This selectivity points to norm-enforcement and deterrence motives: they target those who repeatedly contribute nothing while benefiting from the group. They are willing to absorb sizable personal costs to continue this punishment stream, showing low sensitivity to the personal cost effectiveness of punishment and high commitment to enforcing a cooperative standard. In one notable exception, they punish a previously cooperative player (SLOTH) in the final round after that player has been zero-contributing intermittently and also engaging in heavy sanctioning. This end-game punishment appears consistent with punishing defectors rather than random retaliation: they do not appear to use punishment against those who punished them, and there is no clear pattern of counter-punishment toward their own punishers. Overall, they use punishment as a consistent, morally driven tool against chronic free riders, not as an emotional response to being targeted.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nThey are repeatedly punished by several others, including for both cooperative and defective rounds, and sometimes quite harshly. Their behavioral response is strikingly non-retaliatory: they never clearly punish someone simply because that party punished them earlier, and they do not switch to targeting those who sanction them. Instead, they keep punishing the same norm-violating free riders and keep cooperating in contributions. There is no strong evidence that punishment toward them causes sustained contribution reductions; they defect once after having been a persistent cooperator, are heavily punished, and then return to high contributions. When they are punished in rounds where they cooperate, they neither respond with counter-punishment nor with social withdrawal (e.g., serial defection). This indicates high forgiveness or at least a strong separation in their mind between “who punished me” and “who is violating the contribution norm.” They appear to interpret punishment directed at themselves as part of the general noisy sanctioning environment rather than as a signal to change targets or form vendettas. Compliance-wise, they do not clearly adjust their target selection in favor of their punishers or away from them; they stay focused on chronic low contributors.\n\n<REWARD>\nThe player is a regular and selective rewarder, but much less intense in rewarding than in punishing. They spend on rewards for clear high contributors and for especially prosocial players, often reinforcing those who repeatedly contribute fully and sometimes also engage in prosocial sanctioning. Reward targets include consistently cooperative players and those who have rewarded or supported cooperation in others, indicating a mix of gratitude and reinforcement motives. They almost never reward low contributors, and when a previous free rider begins contributing or stops misbehaving, the player sometimes withholds further punishment but does not immediately move into rewarding them; their rewards are more clearly tied to ongoing, visible cooperation than to one-off improvements. They accept the poor cost-effectiveness of the reward technology and still use it, suggesting a preference for norm reinforcement and positive signaling over simple earnings maximization. Over time, they refine reward targets somewhat, tending to reward a small subset of the most dependable cooperators rather than distributing rewards widely.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThey receive rewards in various rounds from multiple others, yet their reward behavior does not obviously track who has previously rewarded them. They do not build explicit bilateral “alliances” of mutual rewarding; instead, they reward based on perceived overall contribution and cooperativeness. There is no clear tit-for-tat reciprocation of reward to any specific individual that can be tied to a prior incoming reward from that same individual. This suggests that gratitude, while possibly present, is filtered through their underlying norm-based criteria: they appear to value sustained cooperative conduct more than personal kindness toward themselves. Being rewarded does not shift their punishment targets away from free riders nor does it induce them to preferentially protect or defend their rewarders; their sanctioning decisions remain focused on contribution behavior. Overall, their response to being rewarded is to maintain their cooperative and norm-enforcing strategy rather than to shift into alliance-based reciprocity.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey pay close attention to who is contributing and who is not, and they appear to track how others use the punishment and reward mechanisms. Their persistent focus on the same chronic free rider shows that they extrapolate from repeated low contributions to a stable “type” and act accordingly. They seem unperturbed by others’ high payoffs when those payoffs come from cooperation; they even reinforce such players with rewards. Conversely, when free riders maintain relatively high payoffs despite frequent punishment, the player continues to sanction them rather than disengaging, suggesting they are monitoring outcomes and concluding that more enforcement is warranted. They do not appear jealous of high-earning cooperators; instead, they treat them as partners in maintaining a cooperative environment. When observing complex sanctioning by others (for example, other players heavily punishing multiple targets), they do not automatically join those sanctioning campaigns; their response remains anchored in observed contribution patterns rather than in how much someone is spending on punishment or reward. In late game, when others escalate punishment intensity and some players incur severe losses through sanctioning, this player does not mirror that escalation; they keep costs moderate and targets stable. This restraint supports a personality profile of a principled norm enforcer who is attentive to patterns in others’ behavior but resists being drawn into cycles of escalating hostility."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a high-earning conditional cooperator who alternates between free-riding and full contribution in a patterned way. They consistently choose either all or nothing, never intermediate amounts (by design), and over the game they contribute full endowment in most rounds but intersperse sequences of zero contributions. Their cooperation is clearly conditional on others’ behavior: they are much more likely to contribute when the group’s overall contribution level is high and relatively uniform, and they free-ride when several identifiable players give little or nothing, or when defectors are not being effectively disciplined by others. They appear willing to sacrifice immediate private payoff to sustain a relatively cooperative norm when contributions from others look strong and somewhat stable, but they are not a pure altruist: when they see substantial non-contribution with little consequence, they revert to self-interested free-riding. The switching between contribution and free-riding is not random; it tracks shifts in the pattern of group cooperation and (especially) the behavior of a few persistent low contributors. They show no obvious escalating contribution in response to punishment or reward; their own payoffs remain comparatively high throughout, suggesting they are attentive to efficiency but also comfortable exploiting cooperative environments when they judge the norm to be weakly enforced.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nAwareness of the horizon does not lead to a straightforward “end-game collapse” for this player. In the final quarter of the game, they continue to contribute full endowment in most rounds, punctuated by a small number of zero-contribution choices that are consistent with their earlier conditional pattern rather than a simple end-round defection. They even spend on costly punishment very near the end, which is inconsistent with a purely myopic last-round payoff focus. At the same time, their late-game punishments are relatively intense and targeted at repeat low contributors, indicating that they may see the end-game as a final opportunity to sanction norm violators rather than a time to quietly defect. Overall, horizon effects are present but subtle: they do not stop cooperating, and instead use sanctions more aggressively when the game is almost over. Their belief seems to be that enforcing fairness or “settling scores” is still worth the cost, even when future interaction is minimal.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThe player is a selective but sometimes harsh norm enforcer. They do not habitually punish: most rounds they refrain entirely, but when they do punish, they target clear, repeated low contributors rather than random peers. Their pattern shows that non-contributors or chronic under-contributors are the primary triggers; they almost never punish high contributors or those aligned with the cooperative norm. When they do act, they often use only minimal units early (a single unit directed at one player) and escalate to punishing multiple low contributors in the same round later in the game. They never use punishment to retaliate against someone who merely punished them personally; instead, their sanctions align with contribution behavior, not with who targeted them. This strongly suggests a norm-enforcing motive (second-order punishment) rather than spite or interpersonal retaliation. They do not use punishment tactically to improve their own immediate payoff—indeed, some of their multi-target sanctions are clearly costly in net terms—indicating a willingness to incur real personal cost to discipline free-riding and to express disapproval of unfair exploitation.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nThe player is repeatedly punished in earlier and middle phases, often by others who appear to be sanctioning their own defections. After being punished in this way, the player does sometimes shift from free-riding to contributing in subsequent rounds, but this shift is not consistently immediate, nor is it always directly tied to a specific punisher; it coincides with changes in overall group cooperation and punishment patterns more broadly. They do not directly retaliate against the specific individuals who punish them; there is no clear case of them targeting a known punisher simply because that agent sanctioned them. Instead, their later punishment is directed at players who are themselves low contributors. This indicates that they interpret punishment as a signal about cooperative norms rather than as an interpersonal attack. They show a form of compliance at the group-norm level (moving toward more frequent contributions when free-riding is visibly punished), combined with a forgiving, non-retaliatory stance toward specific punishers. They do not form vendettas but update behavior based on the overall environment of sanctions and contributions.\n\n<REWARD>\nThe player never spends on rewards at any point, despite frequently earning high payoffs that would allow them to afford positive transfers. This holds even in periods where group cooperation is very strong and others are engaging in reciprocal or prosocial rewarding. Their lack of rewarding is stable and unambiguous. This suggests that they either regard the reward technology as inefficient (cost equals benefit, whereas punishment has a high leverage) or that their social preference is asymmetrically focused on deterring defection rather than reinforcing cooperation. Put differently, they are willing to pay to harm defectors but not to help cooperators, even when those cooperators are the ones enabling their own high payoffs. This absence of rewarding also indicates that they are not especially interested in building bilateral alliances or signaling gratitude via positive transfers; instead, they rely on contribution choices and occasional punishment as their main social instruments.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThe player receives rewards on several occasions, including at times when they themselves have free-rode and at times when they have contributed fully, but they never reciprocate with rewards. They also show no clear pattern of preferentially benefiting those who rewarded them, either through subsequent contributions or through leniency in punishment; their behavior toward rewarders versus non-rewarders appears similar and driven primarily by each target’s contribution level, not past generosity toward the player. This strongly suggests that they treat incoming rewards mainly as opportunistic windfalls rather than as relationship-building signals. They do not respond with visible gratitude, alliance building, or symmetric transfers. In terms of type, this marks them as low in reciprocal altruism via rewards: their cooperation and punishment decisions are shaped by others’ adherence to contribution norms, not by who has personally treated them kindly.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThe player pays close attention to the structure of others’ payoffs, especially how much different players contribute and how much they are punished or rewarded. Their shifts between cooperation and free-riding track not only group average contributions but also whether chronic defectors are being heavily sanctioned. When they see certain low-contributing players repeatedly avoid strong punishment while enjoying high redistributed payoffs, they are more likely to free-ride themselves or eventually step in as a punisher. Conversely, when most others contribute and sanction defectors, the player is more willing to contribute consistently. Their own punishment choices later in the game show that they incorporate observed histories: they often target players who have shown repeated low contributions over many rounds, indicating memory and pattern recognition rather than short-horizon reactions. They do not appear to respond much to others’ use of rewards; extensive rewarding by some players does not cause them to start rewarding or to differentially treat these prosocial types. Overall, they interpret others’ outcomes primarily as information about fairness and enforcement of norms, and adjust their own contributions and sanctions to align with what they see as justifiable treatment of cooperators vs. free-riders.\n\nType summary (implicit across sections): This player is a norm-focused conditional cooperator and occasional opportunist: they prefer high, stable cooperation backed by strong punishment of defectors, are willing to contribute fully under such norms, are ready to free-ride when they see unchecked defection, and are willing to bear significant personal cost to sanction repeated free-riders, while remaining indifferent to positive-reciprocity via rewards."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a highly stable, near-unconditional full cooperator. They almost always contribute the maximum allowed amount to the public fund and maintain that pattern throughout the game, with a single clear deviation when they contribute nothing. That deviation does not lead to any lasting shift in behavior: they immediately return to full contributions and keep doing so consistently.\n\nTheir cooperation does not appear tightly conditional on others’ exact behavior. They continue to put in the maximum even when a few others occasionally free‑ride or when others are experimenting with punishment and reward schemes. They align quickly with an emerging “everyone maxes” group norm and never attempt to exploit the group after that norm is established.\n\nThey explicitly endorse the cooperative norm in chat, agreeing with the group strategy of maximizing contributions and emphasizing speed and simplicity. When considering alternatives (like mutual rewarding), they focus on process costs (extra clicking, slowing the game) rather than on trying to extract extra private benefit by deviating. This suggests a preference for straightforward, low‑cognitive‑effort cooperation over more intricate, strategically complex schemes.\n\nRisk tolerance with respect to being the “sucker” is relatively high: they keep contributing fully even after seeing that free riders can be punished but also that some players occasionally get away with lower contributions or opportunistic reward use. They appear more interested in maintaining a smooth, coordinated equilibrium than in hedging against possible exploitation.\n\nOverall, they fit a “principled, efficiency‑minded cooperator” type: they adopt the cooperative scheme early and then stick to it with very low volatility, only rarely deviating and not using those deviations to pivot into self‑serving strategies.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nTheir tone is friendly, brief, and cooperative. They participate in greetings at the start and later contribute a small number of comments that affirm the group’s cooperative strategy and prioritize smooth play. They neither lead the group nor remain silently detached; instead, they selectively speak when they can reinforce consensus or clarify their own stance.\n\nThey do not attempt to persuade others through moralizing or threats. When a more complex reward scheme is discussed, they calmly state a practical objection: it would be cumbersome and slow the game. This frames their decision as effort‑ and time‑based rather than distrust‑based, signaling they are cooperative but prefer simple coordination rules.\n\nThey express positive affect toward the group at the end, explicitly complimenting the group. This aligns with a socially warm, group‑oriented style without being chat‑dominant. They engage when relevant but avoid side conversations, jokes, or meta‑analysis of the experiment beyond minimal agreement with others’ points.\n\nOverall, they are a low‑volume, pro‑norm communicator: they speak to affirm cooperative norms, emphasize convenience and speed, and close with appreciation, without trying to control others’ behavior.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey never punish anyone, despite multiple opportunities and clear social support in the group for sanctioning free riders and disruptive behavior. This holds even when others punish obvious defectors and when defectors’ behavior is costly to the group.\n\nThis pattern suggests a strong aversion to using negative sanctions. The absence of any “test” punishment, even once, indicates they are not experimenting with deterrence or retaliation. They appear to rely on others to enforce norms or simply to let the cooperative equilibrium sustain itself.\n\nBecause they never punish, it is difficult to disentangle whether this stems from a principled dislike of harming others, a belief that punishment is inefficient or unnecessary in this already cooperative group, or simple inertia/effort avoidance. There is no explicit statement from them about punishment, so the motivation is unknown, but behaviorally they function as a non‑punishing cooperator who free‑rides on any enforcement others provide.\n\nThey are therefore best characterized as a “non‑sanctioning” type: even in a context where punishment is cheap and socially validated, they abstain completely.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nThey are punished exactly once and rewarded heavily in that same decision stage. They do not respond in chat to having been punished, make no complaint, and show no sign of anger or retaliation. In subsequent moves, they immediately resume full contributions and do not begin punishing others.\n\nThis suggests a forgiving or at least non‑reactive stance toward sanctions against them. They do not appear to interpret punishment as hostile enough to warrant counter‑punishment, nor does it make them withdraw cooperation. Instead, they stay aligned with the cooperative norm.\n\nThey also do not overtly adapt their future strategy in a way that acknowledges punishment (no explicit “I’ll behave” messaging), perhaps because they were already generally cooperative and the zero‑contribution episode looks more like a one‑off deviation than a deliberate defection pattern.\n\nIn summary, their response to being punished is compliance in behavior (maintained full contributions), no visible resentment, and no attempt to sanction the punisher or contest the legitimacy of the punishment.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey never reward anyone, despite many rounds where everyone cooperates and there are obvious candidates for positive reinforcement. Even when another player points out that the reward technology is privately profitable if everyone uses it, they still abstain.\n\nWhen mutual rewarding is discussed, they give a candid explanation: interacting with the extra buttons would “take forever” and slow the game down. They explicitly endorse ignoring the mechanism and just continuing with the simple “max contribution” strategy. This is a rare explicit statement of their underlying preference: minimizing extra interaction cost and game duration is more important to them than extracting an additional coin via coordinated rewards.\n\nThey therefore appear not to be anti‑reward in principle, but anti‑complexity and anti‑friction. In practice, this makes them a non‑rewarder, even in a setting where reward is available, profitable in expectation under full coordination, and socially encouraged by some players.\n\nFunctionally, they are a “minimal‑effort cooperator” with respect to incentive mechanisms: they provide their full contribution to the public good but do not invest further coins or time into formal reward structures.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThey receive a substantial amount of reward in the same stage where they are also punished once. They do not acknowledge these rewards explicitly in chat and do not change their own reward behavior afterward—they continue not to reward others.\n\nThere is no evidence of direct reciprocity toward any rewarder, nor of alliance‑building based on who rewarded them. They do not start engaging more with those players in chat or reward them back. Instead, they maintain the same simple behavioral rule: contribute fully, skip the reward/punishment stage.\n\nThis suggests that being rewarded does not materially alter their strategy or social orientation. They appear to treat reward as a pleasant but non‑decisive windfall, not as a cue to start engaging in reciprocal exchanges.\n\nOverall, their response to reward is neutral‑compliant: they accept it behaviorally (higher payoff), show no visible gratitude or shift in strategy, and continue following their pre‑existing simple cooperation rule set.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey observe a wide range of others’ outcomes, including heavy punishment of free riders, costly reward experiments, and later, fine‑tuned sanctions targeting a specific unreliable cooperator. They almost never comment directly on specific payoff patterns or target choices.\n\nTheir single explicit response related to mechanisms is to the proposal of a mutual reward scheme: they frame their rejection in terms of effort and time rather than fairness or trust. They do not publicly pressure defectors, applaud punishers, or criticize those using the mechanisms in idiosyncratic ways. Instead, they quietly stick with max contributions and endorse the simple cooperative “just max out” approach in line with others’ comments.\n\nThey also do not exploit knowledge of others’ outcomes to improve their private payoff beyond the one occasion of contributing nothing (which could be exploratory, convenience‑driven, or simply opportunistic; motivation is unknown). After that, they ignore the possibility of targeted free‑riding or strategic reward/punishment based on observed histories.\n\nIn sum, they monitor the environment enough to agree with the group’s high‑cooperation equilibrium and to understand that extra mechanisms exist, but they choose not to respond to individual outcomes with tailored strategic behavior. Their dominant reaction to others’ outcomes is to maintain stable, simple cooperation and favor fast, low‑effort play."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a strict, unwavering full cooperator under these payoff conditions. Once they see that the group norm is to contribute the maximum, they consistently mirror that, always choosing the full endowment rather than free-riding. Their behavior does not waver in response to insults, threats, or changing contributions by a few others; they maintain the same cooperative strategy throughout. This suggests they either understand the material incentives and follow a “maximize group returns” rule, or they adopt a simple “do the fair/expected thing” heuristic and stick to it. They show no evidence of conditional cooperation or opportunistic deviation, even when others defect or when they are personally targeted in chat. Risk tolerance appears moderate to high regarding social risk: they accept being singled out and punished in the chat without adjusting their contribution pattern, indicating they are not using contributions strategically to appease others. Their fairness norm is focused on contributing what they see as the correct amount; they do not try to calibrate contributions to punishers or allies, and they never attempt to exploit the public good for private gain.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThe player’s communication is extremely sparse and front‑loaded. Early on, they join the initial pro-cooperation norm with a short, approving confirmation that they are also contributing the maximum. After that, they fall completely silent for the remainder of the interaction, even as they become a focal target of extensive ridicule and threats. They do not defend themselves, do not argue their case, and do not attempt to persuade others or negotiate around punishment. This pattern indicates an avoidance-based communication style once conflict emerges: they withdraw from the social arena rather than contesting status or reputation. Their tone in the single early message is neutral‑positive and cooperative, not aggressive or moralizing. They do not publicly justify their choices or confront others’ bullying, which makes their underlying motives partially opaque to the group. They also show no apparent responsiveness to repeated direct address; even sustained, escalating attempts to provoke them do not elicit any further messages. This suggests either a deliberate choice to disengage from chat or a strong preference to let actions (consistent max contributions) speak for themselves rather than words.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThere is no observable end-game unraveling in this player’s contribution behavior. They continue to contribute the full amount through the final rounds, with no sign of tapering cooperation as the game approaches its conclusion. Their strategy appears horizon-insensitive: the knowledge that the game is finite and nearing the end does not induce them to defect or experiment with lower contributions. They also do not alter their behavior in response to late-game coalition talk against them; despite others openly planning to sacrifice their own earnings to punish them at the end, the player does not retaliate, bargain, or reduce contributions. This consistent pattern suggests they either follow a rule-based strategy (“always contribute the max when it’s efficient for the group”) or they place little weight on short-term personal payoff optimization in the final rounds. Their absence from late-game chat makes it impossible to infer any explicit reasoning or emotional reaction to the end-game dynamics; their internal beliefs and feelings about the group’s plan to target them at the end remain unknown.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThe player never uses the punishment option at any point and appears to ignore social prompts to participate in sanctioning. This is a stable feature of their behavior: they refrain from punishment both when others under-contribute and when they themselves become a central target of hostile talk and threats. There is no evidence of either deterrence-oriented punishment (to enforce group norms) or retaliation (to respond to personal attacks), despite many opportunities and strong social cues to do so. This strongly suggests a “non-punisher” or punishment-averse type. Their abstention does not shift even when sanctioning is framed by others as justified or necessary. Whether this is driven by principled rejection of punitive behavior, indifference to others’ choices, lack of concern for enforcement, or a narrow focus on contribution decisions alone is unknown. However, in practice, they behave as a pure cooperator who does not invest in second-order enforcement and does not engage in costly social control, even under direct provocation."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a stable, unconditional full cooperator. They always contribute the maximum allowed amount in every round, without deviation, despite persistent free-riding by several others and despite increasing boredom and frustration. Their contribution behavior does not become more selfish when others defect, and they do not experiment with low contributions even late in the game or once they know the study has timed out on the platform side. This suggests a strong internal fairness or “do the right thing” norm that is not tightly conditioned on others’ behavior or on marginal incentives in any given round. They appear risk- and hassle-averse in the sense of not tinkering with alternatives; once they understand the simple “max is good for the group” structure, they stick to it. They do not invoke the payoff structure explicitly, but they accept and follow the emergent group norm of contributing fully. Their focus in later rounds shifts from the payoffs to wanting the game to end, yet they still keep contributing fully, indicating that honoring the implicit cooperation rule and “seeing it through” matters more to them than expressing frustration through selfish play.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThey are relatively quiet compared with the most vocal players, but they do participate and engage when the discussion turns to time, boredom, and study logistics. Their tone is casual and mildly humorous, using light sarcasm and internet slang, which signals sociability rather than hostility. They do not attempt to organize contribution levels, argue about who is defecting, or morally lecture others; instead they let others handle norm-enforcement talk. Their main communicative concern is pacing and duration: they repeatedly comment that the game is dragging, emphasize that waiting time exceeds actual gameplay, and push the group to decide or act faster. When others consider leaving, they explicitly tell people they “have to see it through,” revealing an internalized obligation to complete the task and a preference for collective follow-through over individual exit, even after timeouts. They also engage in pragmatic, informational chat (e.g., clarifying the coin–money conversion) and logistical questions (how to obtain the completion code), indicating attentiveness to the experimental context and their earnings. Overall, their style is cooperative, mildly impatient, and task-focused: they engage enough to coordinate expectations about time and payoff, but avoid conflict-heavy or accusatory exchanges and do not lead coalition-building around punishment.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey never spend any resources on punishment at any point, despite having many opportunities and despite obvious, repeated free-riding by specific players. They also never publicly encourage others to punish or reference punishment as a tool, and they do not complain directly about defectors. Their norm-enforcement behavior instead channels into social pressure about completion and speed, not into monetary sanctions. This pattern is consistent with a “non-punitive cooperator” type: they uphold cooperative norms themselves and tolerate some degree of exploitation rather than paying to sanction others. Their non-use of punishment persists even when they are clearly bored and when many others mention or implicitly endorse punishing low contributors, suggesting that their reluctance is principled or at least stable, not just early-game caution. They do not display any retaliatory motives; there is no evidence they attempt to identify, track, or target particular low contributors. Their primary deterrence mechanism, if any, is mild social nudging about staying through the task, not the formal punishment mechanism."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a stable, unconditional full cooperator within the binary-choice environment. They always choose to contribute their entire endowment, even when at least one other group member free-rides and even after seeing that free-riders earn strictly more in those instances. There is no observable adjustment to others’ deviations: they neither reduce their contribution in response to repeated non-contribution by a peer nor increase it in response to full cooperation (since they are already at the maximum). This suggests that, in this setup, they prioritize a norm of consistent cooperation over payoff-maximizing adaptation. \n\nThey appear comfortable accepting some degree of exploitation: they continue to fully contribute when a peer repeatedly contributes nothing and benefits from the pot. Their behavior is consistent with someone who treats cooperation as the “right” or default action rather than as a contingent response. Risk tolerance around being exploited is therefore high; they do not hedge against potential defection. Whether this norm is driven by outcome-based fairness, moral preference for contributing, or experiment demand effects is unknown. Their contribution pattern shows no signs of volatility or experimentation.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThey speak rarely and only when directly relevant to a social check rather than to strategy. They do not initiate coordination about contribution, punishment, or reward; others do that. They join a light social exchange about location and identity and provide a brief, factual self-disclosure consistent with the ongoing chat. They do not comment on who contributes, who free-rides, or how the group should treat defectors. \n\nThe tone is neutral and cooperative; there is no visible frustration or moralizing toward free-riders or punishers/rewarders. They also do not use chat to push others toward higher cooperation or to discourage counterproductive punishment. Overall, they show low verbal engagement with the strategic aspects of the game and minimal persuasion attempts, while still signaling that they are a real, sociable participant rather than a silent bot.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey never use punishment, despite having repeated opportunities and clear targets who contribute nothing and benefit more as a result. The fact that others sometimes punish a high contributor by mistake, and that punishment in general is shown to destroy value, does not trigger any retaliatory or corrective punishment from them. \n\nThis behavior is consistent with a strong reluctance to engage in payoff-destructive sanctions, even for deterrence or norm enforcement. They do not appear motivated by retributive justice or by the desire to discipline free-riders. If they hold a belief about punishment at all, it likely emphasizes its social or efficiency cost over its enforcement benefit, but this is inferred only from inaction and is low-confidence. They show no evidence of selective punishment or threshold-based triggers; their stance appears to be a blanket avoidance of punishing.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey also never use reward, even though others reward high contributors at times and clearly incur personal costs to do so. They continue to fully cooperate without providing any positive reinforcement to others’ contributions. This suggests that they do not treat reward as a necessary tool for sustaining cooperation or as a vehicle for expressing gratitude. \n\nGiven that the reward technology is strictly efficiency-reducing at the group level, one interpretation is that they avoid both punishment and reward as wasteful side-payments that reduce net payoff. However, this is speculative; all that is firmly grounded is their consistent abstention from rewarding. They rely purely on their own stable cooperative behavior rather than on incentive engineering through rewards.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey observe that some players free-ride and earn more in those rounds, that some players spend on punishment and reward, and that these side-actions change payoffs. Despite that, they do not modify their own contributions or start to use punishment/reward in response. Their cooperative strategy remains unchanged regardless of whether free-riders profit, punishers mis-target, or rewarders sacrifice their own earnings.\n\nThey do not verbally react to payoff differences, to someone being punished despite contributing, or to others burning resources to reward cooperators. There is no visible signaling of approval or disapproval of any of these behaviors. This indicates a type who is behaviorally robust: they maintain their own norm of full cooperation while remaining largely indifferent in action and speech to others’ payoff-related choices. Any internal beliefs about fairness or efficiency are not explicitly expressed, so beyond “continues to cooperate regardless of others’ outcomes,” their evaluative stance toward others’ costs and benefits is unknown."

They do not adjust downward when others contribute less, and they do not adjust upward because they already contribute at the maximum. This pattern is consistent both when partners match their contribution and when at least one partner persistently free-rides. They therefore follow an internal cooperative rule rather than reacting to fairness concerns or payoff optimization. Risk tolerance appears high with respect to being exploited, and they do not respond to the strategic risk that others may defect.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nUnknown; there is no observable chat content from this player. Their social style in communication, preference for coordination or persuasion, and responsiveness to messages are therefore all unknown.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThe player shows no end-game decay in cooperation. They continue to fully contribute even as the game approaches the final rounds and in the final round itself, despite having clear information about the finite horizon. There is no observable attempt to “cash out” privately at the end, suggesting either that they disregard standard backward-induction reasoning, or that maintaining cooperative behavior is a dominant personal rule for them independent of horizon length. They neither escalate nor reduce their use of punishment or reward at the end; their inaction on sanctions remains constant.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThis player never uses punishment, even when a partner repeatedly contributes nothing while another partner contributes fully. They also do not use punishment when a new low contributor appears very late in the game. They therefore tolerate free-riding without observable retaliatory behavior. This could reflect a principle against harming others, an aversion to the cost of punishment, a belief that punishment is unnecessary or ineffective, or simple inertia; the exact motive is unknown. They also do not engage in “altruistic punishment” to protect the cooperative co-player from exploitation. Their non-use of punishment is stable across the entire game, not contingent on specific contribution patterns. They do not engage in antisocial punishment either, but that is consistent with their blanket non-use of sanctions rather than selective prosociality.\n\n<REWARD>\nThis player also never uses rewards, even toward consistently high-contributing partners. They do not spend to positively reinforce cooperation, despite having cooperators available and a clearly beneficial group outcome from mutual contribution. The lack of rewarding persists regardless of whether others match their cooperative behavior or whether a free-rider is present. This suggests that, while they are willing to incur large opportunity costs to contribute to the public good, they are not willing to incur additional direct costs to individually incentivize or thank others. Whether this reflects a belief that rewards are inefficient, a desire to keep decisions simple, or indifference to targeted reciprocity is unknown. Their cooperative stance is thus expressed solely through their own contributions, not through sanctioning mechanisms."

Their behavior is extremely stable and does not react to variation in others’ contributions, including repeated free-riding by a specific peer and the later appearance of a new free-rider. They do not appear to condition their cooperation on reciprocity, matching, or fairness; instead they follow a fixed rule that prioritizes maximizing group efficiency given the multiplier. They show no evidence of experimenting, hedging, or adjusting to risk; once they see the structure, they adopt full contribution and maintain it regardless of short-term personal payoff differences or others’ inconsistency. This pattern is consistent with a principled or rule-based cooperator who values the social optimum over individual payoff, even in the face of persistent exploitation.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nUnknown; there is no chat content shown. Their behavioral style (rigid cooperation without sanctioning or signaling via rewards/punishments) suggests a quiet, non-confrontational approach, but this is low confidence because no direct communication is observed.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThey ignore end-game incentives and continue full cooperation through the final rounds. There is no sign of typical end-game decay or strategic defection as the horizon approaches; their contribution rule remains unchanged even in the last round. This indicates either a principled norm of “always contribute,” or a lack of strategic focus on final-round payoff maximization. They appear fully aware of the repeated structure (given the game configuration), yet they treat each round as another opportunity to sustain the socially efficient outcome rather than to exploit others at the end.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey never use punishment, despite repeated and clear opportunities to sanction identifiable free-riders with a highly effective punishment technology. Their refusal to punish holds even when another player systematically benefits from their cooperation and contributes nothing or alternates between full free-riding and full cooperation. This suggests a strong reluctance to impose costly harm, even when it could raise future cooperation or correct unfairness. Their non-use does not appear to be due to lack of information: they can see who contributes and know the potency and cost of punishment. Instead, they behave as a non-punishing cooperator who tolerates exploitation rather than engaging in deterrence or retaliation. Whether this is driven by moral dislike of punishment, belief that others will not change, or indifference to payoff inequality remains unknown.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey never use rewards, even when others match their full cooperation and help create high group returns. This indicates that they do not engage in active norm enforcement via positive incentives either. They rely solely on their own contributions to support the public good and do not invest in reinforcing others’ good behavior, despite the ability to do so and clear episodes of mutual cooperation. This could reflect a simple heuristic (“just contribute, don’t touch sanctions”), a desire to avoid additional costs, or a belief that reward is unnecessary. Overall, they are a purely contributory cooperator: they support the public good through their own actions but do not attempt to shape others’ behavior with either punishment or reward."

Their behavior indicates a strong preference for maintaining a high-public-good, high-payoff environment rather than exploiting it. They do not appear to condition their contribution on others’ average contributions or on being targeted by punishment; contributions remain stable and maximal across cooperative and mildly defective group states. They tolerate some inequity (others free-riding while they cooperate, and unfair punishment) without reducing cooperation, suggesting relatively high social preference for group efficiency and low willingness to use contribution as leverage or retaliation. Their risk tolerance regarding exploitation is moderate to high: they accept the risk of being the “sucker” to keep the public good high, but this occurs in a mostly cooperative group, which lowers the actual cost of that stance.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nUnknown.

It is unknown whether they remain silent or whether chat simply is not shown. Responsiveness to others’ messages, if any, is also unknown.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThis player never uses the punishment option. They refrain from sanctioning a clear free-rider and do not punish anyone even after multiple instances of being targeted themselves. This suggests either a strong aversion to costly punishment, a belief that punishment is unnecessary in a generally cooperative group, or a preference for “live and let live” norms. Their non-use of punishment, despite evidence that someone is exploiting or targeting them, indicates they are not motivated by retaliation and likely place higher value on preserving their own payoff or group harmony than on enforcing norms through sanctions. Whether they would ever punish in more extreme defection scenarios is unknown, but within this context they behave as a non-punisher.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nWhen punished, this player remains behaviorally calm and non-retaliatory. They do not reduce contributions, do not turn to punishment themselves, and do not appear to adjust strategy in response to being targeted multiple times, including instances where punishment is plausibly unjustified by their contribution level. Their pattern is consistent with a forgiving or stoic type: they absorb punishment without escalating conflict and continue to cooperate fully. Because punishers are identifiable in principle but specific identities are not shown here, it is unknown whether they would react differently if they could clearly associate repeated punishment with a particular player; within the observed game, their response is to maintain cooperation and ignore opportunities for revenge. Overall, they comply with their own cooperative norm rather than with the implied threat of punishment, and they do not use sanctions to deter or answer aggression."

Punishment is only deployed when there is a clear free-rider in an otherwise cooperative group, and is not used when everyone contributes fully. This pattern fits a targeted, norm-enforcing use of punishment rather than general aggressiveness. They do not escalate punishment in response to being punished themselves; their punishment decisions track contribution deviations, not personal grievances. The low frequency of punishment suggests either a reluctance to incur personal costs for sanctioning or a preference to preserve payoff efficiency unless there is a salient norm violation. They do not use punishment to “even the score” with those who punish them, indicating low retributive motivation and a focus on contribution behavior over interpersonal retaliation.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nWhen punished, they maintain full contributions without apparent deterrence or withdrawal; they do not respond by reducing cooperation. They also do not respond with counter-punishment, even when they are repeatedly targeted, which suggests a forgiving or at least non-retaliatory stance. Their behavior implies that they decouple their cooperative norm from how fairly they are treated: they continue to cooperate despite being punished and occasionally punished more than others. Whether they interpret the punishment as misunderstanding, noise, or hostility is unknown, but instrumentally they stay on course—keep contributing fully, and only punish in relation to contribution deviations, not as revenge. This frames them as a robust cooperator who is resistant to sliding into punishment spirals and who does not condition their actions strongly on being personally harmed."

This suggests a strong internal norm of contributing fully to the public good, with either low sensitivity to short-term payoff losses or a deliberate preference for norm-consistent behavior over individual earnings. Risk tolerance regarding exploitation appears relatively high, as they accept being the sort of player who can be exploited by lower contributors and by antisocial punishers without adjusting their own contribution strategy. Whether they reason explicitly about efficiency is unknown, but behavior aligns with a preference for maximizing the group benefit rather than own material payoff.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nUnknown. The transcript contains no chat content or direct evidence about how they communicate, attempt to coordinate, or respond to others’ messages. Their social style, tone, and use of persuasion in chat are therefore unknown.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey exhibit very low use of punishment, almost complete abstention despite clear opportunities and repeated instances in which they themselves are punished or others defect. When they do punish, it is rare and minimal. The timing coincides with the presence of a clear free-rider, suggesting the target is likely the non-contributor and that the motive is norm enforcement rather than revenge for being punished. There is no evidence of escalating sanctions, spiteful counter-punishment, or systematic attempts to deter antisocial punishers. Overall, this player behaves as a reluctant or sparing punisher: they mostly avoid spending on punishment even when it could potentially protect their own payoff, and when they do intervene, it is limited and targeted at obvious deviations from full cooperation. This suggests a preference to preserve resources and/or a reluctance to impose costs on others unless a fairness norm is clearly violated.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nWhen punished, they do not respond with retaliation via the punishment mechanism (at least not in any repeated or systematic way), nor do they reduce their contributions. They continue to fully cooperate through and after multiple punishment events, including cases where no deviation in their own behavior could justify the sanction under standard fairness norms. This indicates a non-retaliatory, forgiving, or at least non-confrontational stance toward punishers. They do not appear to use punishment defensively or strategically to signal “don’t hit me,” and they do not shift into self-protection by free-riding. Instead, they maintain their cooperative standard regardless of who punishes them. Whether they interpret punishment as noise, as misdirected, or simply discount its informational content is unknown, but their behavioral response is consistent: they remain a full cooperator and mostly abstain from counter-punishment."

After an initial complete free ride, they shift to contributing the full endowment almost every round, with only a brief moderate contribution phase in the middle. Their contributions then remain consistently high through the end of the game, including the final round, with no visible end-game decay. They do not seem to condition their own contribution on others’ deviations: they keep giving fully even when a persistent low contributor remains in the group and even when there is substantial punishment chaos. This pattern suggests a strong cooperation norm that is largely unconditional rather than tit-for-tat. They tolerate the presence of a clear free rider without reducing their own contribution, indicating low sensitivity to inequity in the contribution stage and a willingness to sustain the public good even when it is not individually payoff-maximizing. Risk tolerance appears moderate to high: they repeatedly expose themselves to potential exploitation and to punishment from others yet do not hedge by lowering contributions.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nUnknown. There is no chat content or explicit messaging in the transcript, so their tone, coordination attempts, and direct persuasion style cannot be inferred. Indirectly, their behavior is “quietly cooperative”: they maintain high contributions without using punishment (after one episode), which functions as an implicit cooperative signal rather than an explicit attempt at coordination. Responsiveness to others via text, and any preference for engagement vs. avoidance in chat, is unknown.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThey display no classic end-game defection. Contributions stay at or near the maximum through the final block of rounds, including the very last round, despite clear evidence that at least one other player persistently contributes nothing and that punishment is intense and costly in the group. There is no sign that they shorten their time horizon or shift to short-term payoff maximization as the number of remaining rounds shrinks. Instead, they maintain their cooperative strategy up to the end. This suggests either a stable preference for cooperation that is not discounted by the looming end of the interaction, or a rule-based strategy (“I always contribute fully”) that is insensitive to horizon effects. They also do not increase punishment near the end, indicating they are not trying to “settle scores” or engage in last-round retaliation.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey almost never use punishment. Across the game they impose it only once. When they do punish, it is broad rather than selective: they target multiple players, including those who are contributing relatively high amounts as well as the obvious free rider. Because punishers are anonymous, they cannot signal or clarify motives. The choice to punish in that episode is not tightly aligned with contribution levels; it does not look like clean norm-enforcing punishment of low contributors. This single, scattered punishment event may reflect a moment of frustration with the overall pattern of deductions and chaos, or an exploratory test of the punishment mechanism, rather than a stable strategy. After this, they revert to zero punishment, even though others continue to impose heavy deductions and they themselves become a frequent target. They do not retaliate when punished and do not escalate. Overall, they are a highly reluctant punisher, not using punishment instrumentally to shape others’ behavior, and showing no consistent pattern of deterrence or revenge.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey are repeatedly punished and often lose substantial payoff due to others’ deductions, yet they do not respond by punishing back or reducing cooperation. Instead, they persist with high contributions and minimal punishment expenditure. This indicates either emotional resilience or detachment from the payoff comparisons: they are not visibly driven by envy or by a desire to restore relative standing via punishment. They also do not appear to reward through “indirect” means such as selectively increasing their own contributions in response to cooperative subgroups; their own contribution pattern is stable and not strongly differentiated by which co-players are present or doing well. Overall, they behave as a robust cooperator who is largely non-reactive to the structure of others’ outcomes—continuing to provide the public good and absorbing both exploitation and punishment without strategic adjustment."

They always contribute their entire endowment, from the very beginning to the very end, without any visible sensitivity to others’ average contributions, payoff differences, or punishment patterns. Their behavior fits a strong efficiency norm: they consistently choose the socially optimal action for the group, even when others free-ride or when they themselves are targeted with deductions. There is no evidence of conditional cooperation, reciprocity, or strategic adjustment; they do not reduce contributions in response to being punished or to persistent zero contributions by others. This suggests either a rigid adherence to a “do the right thing” or “maximize the public good” rule, or a strong preference for simplicity and consistency over strategic tailoring. Tolerance for exploitation appears high: they keep cooperating despite being singled out with negative payoffs multiple times. Risk tolerance regarding others’ opportunism is therefore high; they act as though their own cooperative standard is independent of others’ behavior. Whether this is driven by altruism, a moral rule, or misunderstanding of strategic incentives is unknown.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nChat is enabled in the game, but there is no chat content in the transcript, so their communication style, tone, and responsiveness in messages are unknown. There is no observable attempt at verbal coordination, persuasion, or norm-setting. Based on actions alone, they behave as a quiet, non-confrontational type: they never use punishment to send signals, and they maintain cooperation regardless of others’ actions, which is consistent with an action-based “leading by example” rather than verbal enforcement style. However, without chat logs, their actual engagement or avoidance in communication is unknown, and any inference about their rhetorical style or responsiveness to others’ messages is low confidence.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nAwareness of the time horizon is likely, since the interface displays remaining rounds, but their behavior shows no end-game effect. Contributions remain maximally cooperative through all rounds, with no decay, no attempt to exploit in late rounds, and no visible “last-minute” strategy shift. They do not appear to adopt backward induction or short-term payoff maximization at the end; instead, their decision rule is time-invariant. The absence of any contribution drop or punitive spike near the end suggests either that they prioritize consistency or norms over horizon-based reasoning, or that they do not strongly internalize the strategic meaning of the final rounds. Their long-run pattern is the same as their end-game pattern: stable full cooperation without punitive engagement.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey never use the punishment mechanism at any point. This holds despite repeated opportunities to sanction clear free-riders and despite instances where they themselves are punished. This pattern indicates a strong aversion to spending resources on punishment, even when punishment might plausibly deter low contributors or retaliate against those who target them. The absence of any punishment, even low-cost or symbolic, suggests either: (a) a principled non-punisher stance (e.g., disliking harming others or seeing punishment as wasteful), (b) a narrow focus on maximizing their own unspent coins, or (c) inattention or uncertainty about the punishment stage. Because they continue to cooperate fully in the face of others’ punishment behavior, deterrence is not part of their toolbox, and they do not engage in retaliation. They behave as a “pure cooperator, non-enforcer”: they contribute but do not police group norms through sanctions.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey see everyone’s contributions, payoffs, and punishment patterns, but they do not visibly react to these outcomes in their own decisions. They maintain full contributions even when some players repeatedly contribute nothing and others receive large payoffs while free-riding. They also maintain their behavior when punishment among others becomes intense and sometimes seemingly antisocial, and when they themselves become a target of deductions. There is no sign they try to “reward” good contributors via reduced punishment (they never punish anyone) or to “discipline” low contributors via sanctions. Likewise, they do not appear to adjust in response to fairness violations: being punished without cause does not trigger contribution reduction or aggressive punishment. This insensitivity to observed outcomes suggests that their decision rule is largely independent of the payoff landscape and of perceived fairness. It is consistent with a type who either (a) places intrinsic value on contributing regardless of external responses, or (b) follows a fixed heuristic that does not incorporate feedback. Their beliefs about why others punish or under-contribute are unknown; their actions do not reveal attempts to interpret or counteract others’ outcome patterns."

They overwhelmingly choose the maximum possible contribution and maintain this choice across almost the entire game, with a single, isolated deviation where they keep their full endowment for themselves and then immediately revert to full contributions thereafter. This pattern suggests that their default policy is “always contribute fully,” rather than finely tuning their behavior to momentary payoff changes.\n\nThey appear willing to contribute at high levels even when others’ average contributions are relatively low and volatile. They do not systematically match the group’s average, nor do they visibly punish low contributors by reducing their own contribution after seeing free-riding. Instead, they continue to put in the maximum, indicating low sensitivity to short-term exploitation risk and a high tolerance for contributing in mixed groups that include defectors.\n\nTheir contributions track more with a social or efficiency norm (“it is good to fully contribute”) than with strict reciprocity to individual others. They do not selectively respond to particular peers’ changes in contributions; when others fluctuate between low and high cooperation, this player’s contribution remains essentially constant. The brief instance of zero contribution does not trigger a lasting strategic shift, which suggests either an experiment with self-interest, a momentary test of what happens if they free-ride, or a short-lived reaction to previous low group contributions. Since they promptly return to maximal giving and then stay there, the most consistent interpretation is that they identify as a cooperator and regard the deviation as an exception rather than a new rule.\n\nThey show no sign of gradually decaying contributions as the game progresses. High contributions persist through early, middle, and late phases despite significant variation in the group’s behavior. This indicates strong internal cooperation norms and low volatility: they neither escalate nor withdraw in a tit-for-tat manner, and they do not chase the profit-maximizing individual strategy of persistent low contribution despite having enough opportunities to reconsider.\n\nTheir fairness norms appear to favor collective efficiency over strict payoff equality. They continue to invest heavily even in the presence of repeat low contributors, which implies they accept some inequity in individual payoffs if the group output stays reasonably high. Risk tolerance is high in social terms: they accept being exploited by free riders rather than adopting defensive defection. From the perspective of classic PGG typologies, they most closely resemble a “strong altruistic cooperator” or “norm-driven unconditional cooperator” with only very limited and quickly reversed experimentation with defection.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nAwareness of the game horizon does not meaningfully erode this player’s cooperation. Across the late portion of the game, including the final rounds, they continue to contribute the maximum amount. There is no visible “end-game unraveling” where they reduce contributions as the remaining number of rounds shrinks. Instead, their cooperative stance is maintained right through the final decision.\n\nThey do not attempt to exploit the group in the final round by dropping their contribution, even though doing so would be individually profitable and cannot be punished or rewarded in future interactions. This suggests that their strategy is not based on backward induction about future payoffs, but on a more time-invariant rule or internal standard (“I contribute fully in this kind of game”). Their behavior is consistent with a player who either does not prioritize horizon-based optimization or who values maintaining a cooperative identity or principle more than capturing the one-shot gain from late defection.\n\nThe absence of contribution decay near the end of the game also indicates that they either do not expect others to massively defect in the final rounds, or, if they do, they still choose to cooperate despite that expectation. In either case, the looming end does not shift them into a more self-interested mode. They remain a stable, high contributor from start to finish, with no systematic end-game adjustment beyond ordinary payoff fluctuations caused by others’ changing behavior."

Their strategy aligns with a simple rule: always maximize the group return, even when it entails clear personal exploitation by a persistent low contributor.\n\nThey appear to hold (or act as if they hold) a strong fairness norm that values equal, high contributions from all, but they do not condition their own behavior on that norm being met. Even when one peer repeatedly contributes almost nothing and another peer temporarily departs from full cooperation and then returns, the focal player maintains full contributions with no retaliatory adjustment or testing behavior. This indicates low conditionality: they do not engage in typical reciprocity patterns (no “matching,” “grim trigger,” or gradual reduction in response to defectors).\n\nRisk tolerance is high in social terms: they repeatedly expose themselves to exploitation by a low contributor in order to preserve efficient group outcomes. There is no evidence that they attempt to hedge against the risk of being the “sucker” by contributing less. This suggests a strong intrinsic or rule-based preference for cooperation over outcome-based risk management.\n\nThe contribution pattern suggests either:\n- a principled cooperativeness (e.g., following a moral or rule-based heuristic such as “always contribute everything”), or\n- a payoff-focused recognition that, if others are mostly cooperative, contributing fully is individually lucrative, combined with a willingness to tolerate one persistent free-rider as long as average cooperation remains high.\n\nHowever, because they never experiment with lower contributions, it is unknown whether they consciously compute best responses or simply follow a fixed cooperative rule. Adaptation is minimal to nonexistent; their behavior does not update in response to others’ deviations, suggesting a robust or possibly inflexible cooperative type.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThe player shows no end-game defection or decay in cooperation. Their contribution level remains constant and maximal through the final decision, despite clear knowledge of the finite horizon and the absence of future interaction beyond the last round.\n\nThere is no sign of backward induction or strategic winding down. Instead, they maintain the same cooperative rule until the game ends, even after seeing that a specific peer continues to under-contribute and that the temporary period of universal full cooperation does not persist into the last decision. This indicates that their cooperation is not contingent on future rewards, reputation, or enforcement; it persists independently of shadow-of-the-future incentives.\n\nHorizon awareness in terms of behavior is thus either weak or deliberately overridden by a commitment to stable cooperation. Whether they consciously ignore the end-game logic or do not reason in those terms is unknown, but operationally they behave as a time-consistent unconditional cooperator whose strategy does not change as the game approaches termination."

Their strategy prioritizes maximizing the group’s total surplus over their own relative payoff, indicating low concern for exploitation and inequality in the short run. They show a clear understanding that contributing leads to higher group earnings and behave in line with that belief even when others do not reciprocate. There is no evidence of conditional cooperation, retaliation, or strategic withholding; they neither “teach lessons” nor try to discipline defectors through their own contribution choices. Risk tolerance is high with respect to being exploited: they repeatedly accept the risk (and reality) of earning less than defectors in order to maintain a cooperative norm.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThey communicate in a direct, somewhat blunt, but pro-social and norm-enforcing manner. Their primary use of chat is to push for universal contribution and to discourage others from slacking or sabotaging cooperation. Early on, they actively try to coordinate by telling others to contribute and by framing cooperation as the obvious and rational choice. When others start talking about doing zero or “teaching lessons,” they push back and label that behavior negatively, signaling disapproval of non-cooperative strategies. They participate in the social banter a bit (e.g., questioning whether others are bots), but their main focus remains on getting people to contribute for collective benefit. Tone is occasionally mildly critical or exasperated toward free riders and those encouraging defection, but they do not engage in direct personal attacks or extended arguments. They are responsive to the evolving conversation (e.g., reacting when others propose zero contributions), yet they do not attempt detailed payoff calculations or formal explanations; their persuasion style is more normative (“just contribute,” “don’t be wack”) than analytical. Engagement is moderate: they speak enough to signal their stance and try to shape group norms, but they are not the most talkative player.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThey show awareness of the finite horizon but do not change behavior as the game approaches the final rounds. Even when others openly discuss switching to zero later or coordinating only in the very last round, this does not alter their own strategy: they continue to fully cooperate through to the final round. There is no visible end-game decay in contributions or shift toward self-serving defection. They neither try to exploit a final-round advantage nor attempt a last-minute “demonstration” round in a way that differs from their established pattern; instead, they simply maintain the same cooperative rule throughout. This suggests a rule-based or principle-driven approach (“always contribute”) that is largely insensitive to temporal strategic considerations within the game.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey observe that some participants who do not contribute earn more, and they explicitly recognize such players as undesirable partners (“worst people to play with”). Their language indicates moral frustration with free riders and with those urging collective defection, but this does not translate into changing their own contributions. They do not explicitly discuss exact payoffs or compare final totals, nor do they brag about earnings or express envy toward higher-earning defectors. Their main reaction to outcome patterns is normative rather than calculative: they see persistent non-contributors as socially and ethically problematic, not just strategically inconvenient. When others advocate withholding contributions to “teach lessons,” they oppose this and maintain that continuing to contribute is the better course, suggesting that they value cooperative efficiency over outcome-based retaliation. They show no inclination toward targeted reward or punishment (even if those options were available, there is no behavioral hint that they would use them), instead relying on verbal norm enforcement while personally remaining cooperative."

They tolerate systematic unfairness: they persist in contributing even when some group members consistently take more than they give. This suggests either strong pro-social or norm-following motives, or a belief-based commitment to the idea that “the math” favors cooperation that overrides short-term payoff comparisons. There is no detectable risk aversion in the social sense—they accept being exploited by low contributors and do not hedge by adjusting their own contributions.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThey communicate sparsely but purposefully. Early on, they explicitly state their intention to always contribute fully and justify it with a simple efficiency rationale, indicating both understanding of the payoff structure and a willingness to share their rule with others. Later they briefly react with light humor to the ongoing chat, showing that they are attentive, socially engaged, and not emotionally hostile toward defectors. Near the end, when others share their accumulated totals, they respond with their own, signaling openness and willingness to reveal outcomes. They do not try to shame, threaten, or pressure low contributors; nor do they join in insults. Their style is calm, mildly humorous, and cooperative rather than confrontational. They do not heavily coordinate or lead, but they do make at least one clear, normative statement in favor of full cooperation.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThey show no end-game defection.

When others start talking about “final round” demonstrations or about switching to zero, they do not adjust; they remain consistent with their original cooperative rule.

They do not complain about unfairness, do not call out specific low contributors, and do not reference others’ payoffs except to share their own when asked. There is no attempt to punish through reduced contributions, nor any suggestion that others’ higher earnings change their own behavior. Their limited comments suggest that they understand that full contribution “maximizes” in some sense, but they do not explicitly reconcile this with the observed payoff asymmetries. Overall, they appear outcome-tolerant: they accept that others may exploit the public good without letting that alter their own cooperative stance, and they neither reward nor sanction others beyond implicit encouragement via their own example."

There is no evidence that they attempt to time defection near a perceived end of the game; they keep contributing fully even as others speculate about the number of rounds and the experiment’s structure.\n\nOverall, their strategy is simple, rigid, and norm-driven: always contribute everything, regardless of context, history, or the composition of contributors vs. defectors.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nTheir communication is sparse but clearly pro-cooperative, and oriented toward group coordination. Early on, they explicitly endorse a unanimous, full-contribution strategy and frame it as a shared plan. This indicates an intention to align the group around a simple cooperative rule rather than negotiate nuanced conditional strategies.\n\nThey engage directly but briefly with others, using short, directive messages rather than extended discussion. They call out non-contributing players by name once, urging them to cooperate, which shows they monitor others’ behavior and attempt light social pressure. The tone here is firm but not hostile or insulting; it reflects mild norm enforcement through social prompting rather than shaming or exclusion.\n\nThey do not participate in later meta-discussion about whether others are “real,” the nature of the experiment, or jokes about patience and boredom. This suggests a low emphasis on social banter and a primary focus on the cooperative norm itself. There is no evidence of retaliatory language, sarcasm, or disengagement; once they have stated the all-cooperate rule and nudged defectors, they largely withdraw from chat and simply continue to act cooperatively.\n\nIn interpersonal style, they present as a quiet, principled cooperator: they help initiate the cooperative norm, signal clear expectations, briefly enforce those expectations socially, and then rely on their own consistent contributions rather than ongoing persuasion or argument. Responsiveness to others beyond that is minimal or unknown."

They consistently give their entire endowment to the public fund in every decision, without visible adjustment to the fluctuating behavior of others. They do not attempt to exploit defectors, and there is no evidence that they reduce contributions in response to free-riding or to lower group contributions. Their behavior suggests a strong internal norm favoring full cooperation, even when others intermittently withhold contributions and even though the marginal per-capita return is below 1. They appear comfortable accepting the risk that others may free‑ride, prioritizing group efficiency and norm adherence over short‑term individual gain. There is no sign of strategic experimentation (such as testing partial or zero contributions), and no endgame defection; they maintain the same cooperative level throughout. Their fairness norm seems to be “everyone should give everything,” but they do not enforce this through their own contribution choices; instead, they keep cooperating regardless of unequal behavior by identified low contributors.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThe player communicates sparsely, with brief, socially oriented messages that blend light humor and mild norm enforcement. Early on, they engage in playful self‑presentation, aligning with the group’s casual, friendly tone rather than issuing directives or payoff‑focused arguments. When they do call out a low contributor, they do so in a short, almost teasing way, not in a hostile or moralizing style; this indicates mild peer pressure but not strong aggression or exclusion. Later, they respond positively to another player’s joke, reinforcing group cohesion and rapport instead of revisiting contribution disputes or pressing for stricter cooperation. At the very end, they participate in a light‑hearted preference discussion about avatars, again focusing on social bonding rather than instrumental coordination. Overall, their communication style is affiliative, low‑intensity, and responsive rather than initiatory: they occasionally react to others’ comments but do not lead strategy discussions, do not debate game length or payment structure, and do not try to redesign the group’s approach. They are engaged enough to contribute to the social atmosphere, but they avoid conflict escalation and do not attempt systematic persuasion about contribution behavior."

They consistently choose the maximal contribution available and never deviate, even when this is individually costly relative to free-riders. Their behavior does not appear contingent on others’ recent contributions or on their own payoffs; they maintain the same strategy across all observed rounds. This suggests a strong internal norm or commitment to full contribution rather than payoff-based adaptation.\n\nThey prioritize collective efficiency over short-term individual gain: they keep contributing fully when others are visibly earning higher payoffs by contributing nothing, and they do not switch to free-riding even when persistent non-cooperators exist. They exhibit a fairness/efficiency orientation that is group-focused rather than reciprocity-based; they do not try to “match” the lower contributions of defectors.\n\nRisk tolerance appears relatively high in social terms: they invest fully despite uncertainty about the total number of rounds and despite others’ mixed reliability. There is no visible attempt at strategic timing (e.g., end-game defection), indicating either indifference to such strategic concerns or a stronger commitment to a contribution norm than to payoff maximization. Learning or updating of strategy over time is minimal or absent; they display behavioral inertia consistent with a principled cooperator type rather than an experimenter or learner.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nTheir tone is brief, direct, and cooperative. They clearly state an intention to always contribute, framing their behavior as a stable commitment rather than a conditional proposal. This is more a declaration of strategy than an attempt at bargaining or contingent agreement, but it still signals pro-social orientation and invites coordination by example.\n\nThey do not initiate complex discussion about payoffs, incentives, or others’ behavior, but they are attentive enough to comment on structural aspects of the game (specifically, the stability of the incentive parameter) once it becomes relevant to repeated play. That comment indicates some awareness of the underlying mechanism and suggests that they monitor the rules, not just outcomes.\n\nThey are lightly engaged socially: they greet others once and then speak sparingly. They neither pressure nor criticize non-cooperators, and they do not join others in moral appeals or complaints. Their communication style is low-drama, non-confrontational, and focused on stating their own choices rather than policing others. They respond to the environment with observations rather than persuasion efforts, implying a preference to lead through consistent behavior instead of argument.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThe player sees that some others earn higher payoffs through non-contribution and that contributions and outcomes vary across group members, but they do not verbally express resentment, disappointment, or desire to sanction. Their contribution strategy is unchanged by observing free-riding and payoff inequalities, which implies either tolerance of inequity or a strong preference for adhering to a cooperation norm independent of others’ behavior.\n\nThey do not adjust contributions in response to temporary dips or improvements in group contributions, nor do they comment on specific individuals’ windfalls or losses. Their only explicit reaction tied to group outcomes is an observation about the game’s structural multiplier, not about who is benefitting or losing. This indicates a cognitive focus on the mechanics rather than on interpersonal accounting.\n\nOverall, they respond to others’ outcomes with behavioral steadfastness rather than reactive adaptation. They neither reward cooperators (beyond continued cooperation) nor attempt to “punish” defectors via their own contribution choices. Their type is best described as a principled, structurally aware, yet non-confrontational cooperator who maintains full contribution regardless of observed payoffs or others’ deviations."

They always contribute their full endowment, and this pattern does not change in response to others’ free-riding or partial cooperation. Their behavior suggests a strong internalized norm that “everyone always contributing” is the proper or optimal arrangement, and they personally adhere to it even when it is not payoff-maximizing for them individually.\n\nThey appear to reason in terms of group efficiency rather than individual gain: they explicitly link universal contribution to maximizing collective and individual payoffs. They do not display strategic retaliation or strategic withdrawal of contributions when others defect; instead, they maintain cooperation despite clear evidence that some players systematically benefit more by not contributing.\n\nConditional cooperation is not strongly expressed: their contributions do not decrease when others fail to cooperate, even after repeated evidence of this pattern. This implies low responsiveness of their contribution level to social disappointment or exploitation. Risk tolerance for being exploited is high: they keep acting cooperatively despite repeated instances where doing so leaves them with lower payoffs than some defectors.\n\nThey hold a fairness norm centered on mutual contribution: they verbally reference an expectation that everyone should contribute, showing that equal participation is part of their fairness ideal. However, they do not convert that fairness expectation into strategic sanctions or self-protective defection. Instead, they separate “what should happen” (universal cooperation) from their own actual behavior (always cooperate), even when others violate the norm.\n\nOverall, they can be characterized as a norm-driven, group-efficiency-oriented cooperator who prioritizes stable full contributions over adaptive payoff-maximizing or retaliatory strategies.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nTheir communication style is brief, friendly, and oriented toward coordination and clarification rather than confrontation. They greet others, engage positively with cooperative proposals, and introduce or reinforce the idea that universal contribution leads to better outcomes. They also show interest in understanding the game’s structure (e.g., duration), which indicates a reflective and somewhat analytical stance, but they do not translate this into more complex strategy.\n\nThey try to guide the group toward a cooperative equilibrium by explicitly endorsing full contribution as the best option and by aligning themselves verbally with that norm. However, their persuasion is soft and non-authoritarian: they express expectations and agreement rather than issuing demands or calling out specific non-cooperators.\n\nThey show mild, non-aggressive disappointment when actual behavior diverges from the previously stated cooperative norm, but the tone stays neutral to polite and does not escalate into blame or shaming. Their engagement is selective but responsive: they answer or build on others’ cooperation-focused comments and questions, and they acknowledge group-oriented suggestions. They do not initiate complex plans or repeated lobbying; instead, they make a few key norm-affirming statements and then rely on others to follow.\n\nOverall, their communication reflects a cooperative, consensus-seeking personality: they attempt light coordination, emphasize mutual benefit, avoid direct criticism, and remain engaged but not domineering in the chat.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey clearly attend to how others behave and what payoffs result, as shown by their references to everyone contributing and their comments when the actual contribution pattern diverges from the earlier cooperative understanding. They notice inconsistency between stated group intentions and realized actions and express this as a form of mild expectation-violation rather than as anger or moral outrage.\n\nDespite recognizing that some players’ strategies yield them higher payoffs through non-contribution, the focal player does not adjust their own contribution level in response. This indicates that observing others’ advantageous free-riding does not trigger punitive withdrawal of cooperation. They continue to fully contribute even when it is evident that this leaves them relatively worse off than persistent defectors. Their main reaction is verbal reinforcement of the “everyone contributes” ideal, not behavioral punishment or strategic defection.\n\nThey align themselves with other cooperative voices in the group and verbally agree with claims that universal cooperation is best for payoffs. When other players reiterate that everyone should contribute to obtain higher earnings, the focal player explicitly endorses this, signaling social alignment with cooperative subgroups. They do not single out or criticize specific high-earning defectors or low contributors by name, suggesting an avoidance of interpersonal conflict or blame despite unequal outcomes.\n\nIn summary, their response to others’ outcomes is to cognitively register exploitation and norm violation, express light disappointment and reaffirm cooperative norms, but maintain their own full-cooperation strategy without retaliatory adaptation."

There is no observable volatility or conditional adjustment in response to free-riding or changes in group averages. Their reasoning appears efficiency-oriented: they explicitly frame contribution as the way for the group to obtain the highest possible monetary outcome. They show no sign of risk aversion about being exploited; they keep contributing fully even when others clearly benefit more from not contributing. Fairness concerns are present but expressed as a collective optimality norm (“everyone should contribute for maximum group gains”) rather than as a trigger for retaliation or withdrawal.

Later, they reiterate this argument in a slightly more emotive, encouraging style, using positive framing rather than blame or accusation. Their tone is friendly, non-confrontational, and inclusive; they appeal to shared benefit and do not single out defectors or shame anyone.

When defectors earn more, they do not express anger, call out specific individuals, or threaten to change their own contribution level. Instead, they double down on emphasizing that collective contribution increases everyone’s payoff, including their own. Their reaction to others’ higher earnings from defection is to restate the cooperative efficiency norm, indicating a focus on long-run or group-level outcomes over short-run equity enforcement. They welcome others’ verbal commitments to contribute and align with those statements, but they do not condition their own strategy on whether those commitments are actually fulfilled. With no punishment or reward tools available, they rely solely on appeals to mutual gain rather than on any form of sanctioning or selective reciprocity. Their behavioral profile suggests a stable, norm-driven cooperator who remains cooperative even in the face of exploitation and uses outcomes primarily as opportunities to reassert the benefits of full-group cooperation."

This suggests either a norm-based strategy (“I do what I think is right regardless of others”) or a belief that consistent high contributions are the best way to support or stabilize group cooperation. Their willingness to keep contributing fully in the presence of non-contributors indicates relatively high social risk tolerance: they accept being exploited by free riders in order to sustain collective benefits.\n\nThey also show no sign of strategic adjustment or tit-for-tat behavior; their contributions are both high and rigid rather than reactive. Fairness concerns, if present, do not translate into reduced giving in response to others’ lower contributions. This could reflect a strong internal fairness or duty norm, a desire to avoid personal responsibility for efficiency losses, or a belief that the game’s structure makes full contribution the rational choice regardless of others’ actions. Exact underlying beliefs about others’ motives and future behavior are unknown.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nNo chat content from the focal player is observed, so their communicative style, tone, and responsiveness are unknown. There is no direct evidence that they attempt to coordinate, persuade, or sanction others verbally, nor that they avoid or engage in social exchange.

This suggests that their cooperative behavior is not driven by a dynamic or reputation-based strategy that tapers off when future interaction opportunities disappear. Instead, they treat the end of the game similarly to earlier stages, consistent with a rule-based or principle-driven approach to cooperation.\n\nThey do not appear to exploit the last round to free ride, despite having full awareness of the finite horizon. This pattern implies that end-game incentives to defect are either not salient to them, are consciously ignored in favor of a cooperative norm, or are believed to be outweighed by the perceived benefits (moral, efficiency, or otherwise) of continuing to contribute fully. Any finer-grained beliefs about how end-game behavior of others should change, or how they emotionally react to others’ choices in the last round, are unknown."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is primarily a high, almost unconditional cooperator who occasionally experiments with defection. For the overwhelming majority of the game, they contribute the maximum possible amount regardless of whether others do the same. Their cooperation is only weakly conditional: when some group members free‑ride repeatedly, the player still continues to contribute fully most of the time instead of matching or undercutting them. They do, however, test defection a couple of times after a long run of full cooperation, indicating they are not a pure altruist; they are willing to see what happens when they keep their endowment, even after having helped maintain a cooperative norm.\n\nTheir fairness norm is pro‑group but relaxed. They clearly prefer full-contribution outcomes and express appreciation when a previous low contributor starts contributing. At the same time, they are tolerant of deviations and do not push others aggressively toward the norm. When they defect once in an otherwise cooperative environment and are heavily punished, they immediately revert to full contributions and largely stay there, suggesting they are sensitive to social feedback and willing to “fall back in line” when norm enforcement is strong.\n\nRisk tolerance appears moderate. They are willing to risk being a consistent cooperator even when some others are not, accepting lower immediate payoffs for the chance of sustaining high group returns. Their two zero‑contribution choices look like controlled probes rather than a wholesale strategy shift: they do not cascade into continued free‑riding, nor do they signal a desire to dismantle cooperation entirely. There is no evidence of systematic payoff optimization; behavior is more consistent with a cooperative default plus occasional opportunistic or exploratory non‑cooperation.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThe player’s tone is relaxed, mildly humorous, and de‑escalating. When another player becomes critical of non‑contributors, they respond by downplaying the seriousness of the situation and framing it as “just a game,” signaling low appetite for social conflict and moralizing. They do not join in blaming or shaming talk, even when they might be justified in doing so as a consistent contributor.\n\nThey engage selectively rather than constantly. When they do speak, it is purposeful: once to cool down tension, once to clarify payoff information, and once to express gratitude toward a previously uncooperative member who starts contributing. This shows responsiveness to both emotional and informational aspects of the interaction, but they do not try to lead or organize the group.\n\nPersuasion style is soft and indirect. They neither instruct others what to do nor threaten them. Instead, they acknowledge others’ efforts and ask neutral questions about the reward structure. Their engagement style is cooperative and affiliative but not highly invested; they care about good outcomes and smooth interaction, yet they also keep a bit of emotional distance, emphasizing that the stakes are limited.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThere is little evidence of a classic “end-game collapse” pattern. The player’s contribution profile near the end stays mostly aligned with their general cooperative tendency. They do not make a clear, strategic shift to sustained free‑riding in the final rounds despite knowing the horizon length, nor do they ramp up contributions uniquely at the very end.\n\nTheir occasional switch to non‑contribution occurs in the later middle of the game, but it is brief and reversed quickly. After testing defection and encountering strong punishment, they largely return to full contributions, including in the last stretch. This suggests that horizon awareness does not dominate their behavior; they appear more anchored in ongoing group norms and recent social feedback than in backward induction logic. Any end‑game awareness influence is weak or unknown.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey never use the punishment mechanism in any round, even when doing so could credibly enforce cooperation or retaliate for heavy sanctions against them. This indicates a strong reluctance to spend personal resources to harm others, even in cases of clear free‑riding or personal grievance.\n\nTheir threshold for punishing appears extremely high or absent. They experience a severe deduction after a single defection yet do not retaliate against any identifiable partner. Nor do they use sanctions earlier to discipline chronic under‑contributors, despite repeated opportunities and a group norm that openly supports penalizing non‑contributors. This pattern points to a non‑punitive, low‑aggression type: they accept that others may misbehave or punish them without actively engaging in retribution or norm enforcement.\n\nMotivationally, they lean toward “live and let live” rather than either prosocial punishment (to protect the group) or antisocial punishment (to punish cooperators). They seem to rely on persuasion, tolerance, and their own cooperative example rather than formal sanctions to shape behavior. Any latent deterrence motives are unknown or not expressed.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nWhen they defect once after a long record of cooperation and then receive a very large punishment, their behavioral response is compliant and conciliatory rather than hostile. They do not reduce contributions in anger; instead, they immediately return to full contributions in the next cooperative opportunity and maintain that behavior in subsequent rounds. This suggests that they interpret punishment as a strong social signal to re‑adhere to the norm, and they comply without overt protest.\n\nThey show no evidence of retaliating against punishers, despite punishers being identifiable and the deduction being harsh enough to plausibly provoke revenge in many players. They also do not confront anyone verbally about the punishment. This implies a forgiving or at least resignation‑oriented stance toward being sanctioned. They update their play rather than their willingness to attack others.\n\nAt the same time, they do not explicitly apologize or self‑justify in chat; their response is behavioral rather than verbal. Their core pattern is: accept the social cost, restore cooperative behavior, and avoid escalation. Their stance toward the punishing individuals themselves remains behaviorally cooperative and non‑aggressive, consistent with a conflict‑averse, norm‑sensitive cooperator type."

They usually choose the cooperative option, contributing their full endowment when they perceive that others are generally doing the same. Their deviation into not contributing appears reactive to perceived low or inconsistent average contributions by others rather than a fixed selfish preference. After that trial of free-riding, they revert to full contributions and maintain that pattern until the end, even when some others keep contributing nothing. They seem to hold a norm that everyone should contribute fully, and they implicitly treat non-contributors as norm violators rather than as rational payoff maximizers. Their risk tolerance appears moderate: they stick with contributing even though some others are not, apparently trusting that enough players will continue to cooperate to make contributions worthwhile, but they are willing to test non-contribution once when frustrated. They pay attention to who is persistently not contributing and track this across rounds.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nTheir tone is norm-enforcing but not hostile, using light humor or softening signals (such as friendly punctuation) when calling out non-contributors. They actively engage in chat, referencing specific players who are not cooperating and aligning with others who want high contributions. They attempt mild social pressure and coordination: they publicly signal that non-contributors are visible and later explicitly name specific low contributors, reinforcing the idea that the group can monitor and sanction them. They echo and reinforce others’ informational messages, which suggests they see communication as a tool to build shared awareness and to justify punishment. They respond to others’ comments rather than monologuing, indicating a cooperative, interactive communication style oriented toward group-level coordination on norms and sanctions.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThey do not significantly reduce their contribution level as the game approaches the final rounds; they continue to choose the cooperative contribution option even in the last round. However, their use of punishment becomes more targeted at the very end, extending sanctions to a persistent non-contributor who had been free-riding across many rounds. This suggests some awareness that consequences can be imposed even when there is no future to shape behavior, implying a mixture of norm-enforcement and perhaps expressive or retributive motives rather than purely forward-looking deterrence. There is no clear evidence that they change their cooperative strategy purely because the game is ending; instead, end-game effects appear primarily in the choice of whom to punish, not whether to contribute.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey are a selective, low-intensity punisher focused on clear non-contributors. They are willing to spend on punishment multiple times but only in small units and only against players who repeatedly give nothing or near-nothing. Their choices are consistent with second-order cooperation: they aim to enforce a contribution norm and support group welfare by making free-riding costly. They also coordinate their sanctions with chat-based labeling of defectors, publicly highlighting targets before or while punishing. Their punishment is not retaliatory in the narrow sense (there is no direct evidence they are responding to being personally punished) but rather directed at those violating the contribution norm. They do not appear to punish conditional cooperators or those who merely reduce contributions somewhat; they focus on persistent zero contributors. They never use punishment against high contributors, which suggests a clear fairness norm and avoidance of antisocial punishment. Their final-round punishment of a chronic non-contributor, despite no future rounds, indicates that disapproval and norm expression themselves are valued, even without future incentive effects.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey never use the reward option despite frequent high contributions from many others. This suggests that they either undervalue positive reinforcement compared to punishment or view it as unnecessary given that cooperation is already relatively high. It is also possible they see rewarding as less efficient or less justified than punishing clear violations, or they may simply prioritize conserving their own payoff over paying for rewards. There is no evidence of gratitude signaling through costly rewards; their norm-enforcement style is one-sided (punish defectors) rather than symmetric (reward cooperators and punish defectors).\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey monitor others’ behavior in detail, particularly who contributes nothing and how often. Their chat explicitly references specific players’ ongoing non-contribution and aligns with others calling for punishment, showing that they integrate observed outcomes into both talk and action. They seem indifferent to how much others spend on punishment itself and do not comment on extreme punishers; their attention stays on who is being free-ridden on and who is free-riding. They show no explicit emotional reaction to large negative payoffs suffered by punished free-riders, nor do they express sympathy for heavily sanctioned players. Conversely, they also do not praise or comment on high contributors’ payoffs. Overall, they focus on identifying and sanctioning norm violators rather than on the distributional consequences of punishment or on celebrating cooperative outcomes."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a generally high contributor with conditional tendencies and some volatility. They start by fully cooperating and repeatedly return to full contribution. At one point they noticeably reduce their contribution despite ongoing group appeals for maximum giving, suggesting sensitivity to perceived unfairness or free-riding and a willingness to protect their own payoff when cooperation appears unstable. Later they lower their contribution again in the midgame, even as others are pushing for full contributions, reinforcing that their cooperation is not unconditional. Toward the end, they revert to consistently high contributions and maintain them through the final rounds, indicating that they value the public good when they believe others will also contribute, and they do not exploit the end of the game to free-ride. Overall, they appear to follow a conditional cooperation rule: they are willing to give a lot when they expect others to do the same, but they scale back somewhat when they see repeated under-contribution. They show moderate risk tolerance, willing to invest fully even when some group members are uncooperative, but not so trusting as to keep contributing at the maximum after repeated evidence of persistent free-riders.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nUnknown; this player does not send any chat messages in the transcript. As a result, their tone, explicit persuasion attempts, and responsiveness in dialogue are unobservable. Their engagement style via communication is therefore unknown. Any beliefs or strategies must be inferred solely from contribution and punishment behavior.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThey appear aware of the horizon, as later-round coordination talk in the group explicitly references the last round and threats of heavy punishment for low contributors, and their own behavior aligns with a “finish strong” cooperative stance rather than an endgame defection. In the final part of the game, they maintain full contributions even when some others continue to give nothing, and they do not exploit the final round to reduce their contribution for personal gain. Their punishment behavior does not escalate in the very last round; they use strong punishment earlier and then cease punishing later, even when coordination talk suggests continued sanctioning of low contributors. This pattern suggests that, by the end, they prioritize securing stable, high returns through cooperation rather than pursuing additional retaliation or deterrence, and they do not display the classic late-game collapse of cooperation.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey demonstrate a willingness to punish, including an episode of extremely heavy, costly punishment directed at low contributors. For multiple earlier rounds they refrain from punishing at all, even when free-riding is present and others are already using punishment. This indicates that punishment is not their default: they initially tolerate some deviation or rely on others’ sanctions. Later, they engage in moderate-cost punishment and then in one round impose very large total punishment at high personal cost, targeting clear under-contributors who repeatedly give nothing or very little. This heavy punishment strongly harms their own payoff, suggesting a willingness to sacrifice substantial income to sanction perceived unfairness and repeated free-riding, more consistent with norm-enforcement motives than with pure payoff maximization. They never appear to punish high contributors or engage in “antisocial” punishment; their targets are consistently those contributing much less than the cooperative norm. After this intense sanctioning episode, they return to using no punishment even when non-contributors persist, which may indicate that they see their earlier punishment as a one-time corrective attempt, or that they learn the marginal effectiveness is low and choose to conserve payoff. Overall, they are a conditional, fairness-driven punisher who escalates sharply when patience runs out, focuses punishment on chronic low contributors, and does not use punishment for retaliation against those who punish them (they themselves are never deducted) or for opportunistic reasons.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey observe others’ outcomes without overtly reacting in chat, so their explicit emotional or verbal responses are unknown. Behaviorally, they tolerate initial punishment patterns by others without joining in, suggesting they are not immediately influenced by others’ sanctioning costs or outcomes. When low contributors repeatedly avoid strong punishment or continue to earn relatively high payoffs despite free-riding, they eventually intervene with heavy punishment, implying that they track the mismatch between contribution effort and resulting payoffs. They appear especially triggered when some players both contribute nothing and have not been adequately deterred by prior sanctions, prompting them to spend a large share of their own payoff to reduce those players’ earnings. Later, even after coordination messages encourage everyone to punish under-contributors, they abstain from further sanctions despite ongoing free-riding and despite others still imposing deductions. This suggests that their response to others’ outcomes is not purely imitative; instead, they selectively step in when they judge free-riders’ net outcomes as intolerably high relative to contributors, and then revert to payoff-focused restraint once they have expressed that norm-enforcing response or once the cost-benefit of further punishment appears low. Their sensitivity centers on fairness in final payoffs rather than on copying others’ punishment intensity."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a high, near-steadfast contributor. They routinely give the maximum possible amount and only rarely drop to a moderate level. The default stance is: “I put a lot into the pot,” even when others contribute much less on average. They do not clearly condition their own giving on the exact pattern of others’ contributions; brief reductions in their contribution level do not systematically align with any clear cooperative collapse or with particular individuals’ behavior, and they quickly return to full contributions afterward. There is no evidence that they try to fine-tune contributions to reward specific high contributors or punish low contributors through their own giving. They appear willing to accept unfavorable payoff comparisons rather than scale back giving to protect themselves from free-riding. This suggests a strong, internally anchored cooperation norm and a tolerance for exploitation. They do not appear to strategically exploit late-game opportunities to free-ride and instead maintain very high contributions even when the number of remaining rounds is minimal.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nAwareness of the game horizon does not noticeably change their strategy: they continue to contribute heavily in late rounds, including the final one, and never shift into a clear end-game defection pattern. There is no late decrease in contributions that would indicate backward induction or “last-round grabbing.” Their approach to rewards (none throughout) also does not change as the end approaches. This suggests that they either do not place much weight on strategic end-game optimization, or they prioritize maintaining a consistent cooperative identity over exploiting final-round opportunities. They treat the end of the game as largely irrelevant for their own behavioral norms.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey never spend any coins on rewarding others, despite having repeated opportunities and being surrounded by players who frequently use the reward mechanism, sometimes at considerable personal cost. This is a stable, persistent choice. Given their high contributions, this pattern is not consistent with pure selfishness focused on maximizing private payoffs through minimal cooperation; instead, it points specifically to an aversion to engaging with the reward instrument. Likely interpretations (each with low to moderate confidence): they may see peer-to-peer rewarding as unnecessary, ineffective, or too costly relative to its benefits; they may dislike taking on an explicitly “judging” or “allocating” role; or they may prefer that cooperation remain unconditional and not transactional. In any case, they do not use rewards to shape others’ behavior, build alliances, or reciprocate. They effectively free-ride on the presence of rewarders while refusing to become one themselves.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThey receive reward from others multiple times, including persistent transfers from certain players who seem to recognize their high contributions. Despite this, they never reciprocate via the reward channel, even toward those who consistently give to them. There is no visible tit-for-tat or alliance-building: they behave the same way toward those who reward them and those who do not. This suggests that they do not treat received rewards as a signal that must be answered in kind. Their gratitude, if present, does not manifest in monetary reciprocity. They may treat rewards as a bonus that does not alter their own cooperative policy, or they may simply disregard the individual-level patterns of who gives them what. Their behavior is compatible with a “principled cooperator who ignores side-payments” rather than a reciprocity-driven strategist.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey consistently see that others are spending heavily on rewards, sometimes at substantial personal cost, and that low contributors often earn high payoffs relative to them. Nonetheless, they do not adjust their contributions downward in a sustained way, nor do they begin rewarding (either to support high contributors or to reinforce rewarders’ costly prosociality). They also do not attempt to mirror others’ reward spending patterns. This indicates that they are relatively insensitive to inequities in realized payoffs and to the strategic use of the reward tool by others. They tolerate being out-earned and do not retaliate or compensate via behavioral change. They also appear unmoved by the fact that some players incur major losses through over-rewarding; there is no observable protective or supportive response, nor any attempt to exploit such players with calculated behavior. Overall, they focus on maintaining their own high-contribution standard and largely ignore the detailed distribution of others’ payoffs, costs, and side payments.\n\nType label (summary, for use in other contexts):  \nA steadfast, norm-driven high contributor who largely ignores peer reward systems and end-game incentives, cooperates almost unconditionally, and shows little inclination toward reciprocity or strategic adaptation based on others’ outcomes."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a highly cooperative, near-unconditional full contributor. They overwhelmingly choose to contribute their entire endowment rather than free-ride, with only a single observed deviation where they keep their endowment. That lone deviation does not launch a new pattern; they immediately revert to full contributions thereafter. This suggests their primary “default” is to cooperate rather than to exploit.\n\nTheir behavior shows only weak conditionality: contributions remain high whether the group’s average is slightly lower or higher, and whether some peers free-ride or not. They do not visibly track or mirror specific peers; instead they appear to anchor on a personal norm of contributing fully to the public good. This implies a fairness or efficiency norm that values maximizing group returns even when others are uneven contributors.\n\nThey accept the strategic risk that others might exploit their generosity. The payoff structure makes free-riding individually attractive, yet they rarely do so, which indicates a willingness to sacrifice some personal security for cooperative outcomes. The isolated non-contribution can be interpreted as a brief test of the payoffs or a momentary experiment, not as evidence of a shift to self-interest, since it is not repeated.\n\nOverall, this player fits a “principled cooperator with high tolerance for imperfect group behavior”: they keep contributing even when some free-riding is visible, and they do not seem to react strongly to minor fluctuations in group cooperation.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThere is no pronounced end-game collapse in their cooperation. They maintain full contributions through the final rounds instead of switching to systematic free-riding as the horizon approaches. The single non-contribution occurs in the late game but is immediately followed by a return to full cooperation; thus it does not function as a classic “last-period” defection pattern.\n\nThis suggests that they either (a) do not rely on backward induction to justify defecting near the end, (b) deliberately reject end-game logic in favor of a stable cooperative identity, or (c) attend more to their own norm than to the finite horizon. The fact that they fully cooperate in the very last round indicates that horizon awareness does not dominate their behavior; if they are aware of the remaining rounds, they still choose to act as a cooperator rather than to exploit the lack of future consequences.\n\nThe end-game pattern therefore points to a type who is norm-driven or habit-driven rather than purely outcome-driven. They do not strategically unwind their cooperation even when, from a narrow monetary standpoint, that would be individually optimal.\n\n<REWARD>\nThis player never spends resources on rewarding others, despite having many opportunities and often sitting in cooperative groups where reward could further reinforce prosocial behavior. At the same time, they repeatedly receive reward units from others, sometimes in substantial amounts. They accept these benefits but do not reciprocate through the mechanism provided.\n\nFrom this pattern, it appears they separate cooperation from social reinforcement: they are willing to incur the cost of contributing to the public good itself but are unwilling to incur the additional cost of meta-cooperation via reward. They might see direct contribution as the “proper” channel for helping the group and view reward as unnecessary, inefficient, or strategically opaque—especially given that rewarders and recipients are anonymous and they cannot target specific individuals based on behavior.\n\nTheir lack of rewarding does not change even when they are the target of generous rewards, suggesting that gratitude, if present, does not translate into costly reciprocal reward-giving. They also do not use the reward mechanism as a tool to shape others’ contributions; there is no observed attempt at strategic reinforcement. Overall, they are a pure contributor rather than a “social enforcer”: they invest in the public good itself but abstain from second-order cooperation via rewards."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a steadfast, unconditional cooperator. They always contribute their full endowment and never deviate, regardless of how much others give or how cooperation fluctuates in the group. Their contribution pattern is extremely stable and shows no evidence of conditionality on others’ behavior; they do not reduce their own giving even when free-riding is present or when overall group contributions drop. They appear to follow a strong internal norm that “one should contribute,” rather than responding to short-term payoff incentives, which would favor keeping the endowment. This suggests a high valuation of group efficiency and public-good provision, along with either low sensitivity to exploitation or a willingness to tolerate it. They accept the risk of being the consistent contributor in a mixed group, prioritizing the social optimum over personal earnings. Fairness, in their behavior, is not enforced by matching others but by persistently doing what they treat as the cooperative baseline, independent of what others do.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nAwareness of the finite horizon does not reduce their cooperation; they maintain full contributions until the very last round, with no sign of end-game decay. Instead of “unraveling” as the end approaches, they continue to behave as they have all game. If anything, they become more active with the reward tool toward the end, suggesting that they think about the closing rounds as opportunities to reinforce or recognize cooperation rather than to exploit others. There is no observable shift toward self-serving behavior in the final rounds. This indicates that they either do not reason in a backward-induction, payoff-maximizing way, or they deliberately reject that logic in favor of consistent cooperative principles. Their horizon awareness seems to increase their use of social tools (reward) rather than change their core contribution strategy.\n\n<REWARD>\nThis player is an active, sometimes heavy, rewarder who uses reward as a cooperative reinforcement tool rather than as a precise, efficiency-focused investment. They repeatedly spend substantial portions of their available payoff on rewarding others, including in situations where group cooperation is already high and where the personal cost of rewarding is significant. Their willingness to pay for others to benefit is strong and persists even when the direct financial return from doing so is uncertain or low. They do not appear to use reward in a tightly calibrated, strategic way aimed at maximizing their own future earnings; instead, their pattern fits a prosocial or norm-enforcing style, aiming to support or encourage contributors. They do not systematically withhold reward when others free-ride, but the available data do not reveal how they target specific players, so the exact trigger rules and recipient selection are unknown. Late in the game, they are willing to increase reward spending rather than conserve resources, implying that they treat reward as an expression of cooperative commitment or appreciation rather than a long-run investment tool. Overall, they behave like a principled cooperator who is prepared to incur personal costs to sustain or recognize contributions by others."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is generally a high contributor who initially follows a cooperative, all-in strategy. They are willing to contribute fully even when others do not match their level, at least for several periods. Their behavior indicates a baseline norm that full contribution is the “right” or expected action. However, they are not unconditionally altruistic: when free-riding persists and the environment looks unfavorable, they temporarily switch to free-riding themselves, then revert to full cooperation once others are also fully contributing. This pattern suggests conditional cooperation with some threshold of tolerance for unfairness. They appear to track relative behavior (who is repeatedly free-riding vs. who is consistent) and adjust their own cooperation in response to the overall contribution profile rather than to marginal changes. Risk tolerance regarding cooperation is moderate: they are willing to risk losing payoff by contributing fully for several rounds despite visible defectors, but they eventually protect their own payoff when others do not reciprocate. Overall, they fit a “principled but pragmatic conditional cooperator” type.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nNo explicit chat is shown, so communication style is unknown. There is no evidence of written persuasion, coordination attempts, or emotional expression. Their only observable “communication” is via actions: consistent early full contributions and targeted punishment against specific others. These choices implicitly signal expectations of cooperation and disapproval of free-riding, but any verbal tone or responsiveness in chat is unknown.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThis player is clearly willing to use costly punishment and does so multiple times. Their targets are selectively chosen and not random: they focus on peers whose contribution behavior is uncooperative or disproportionately advantageous relative to others. They seem to use punishment as a norm-enforcement and deterrence tool rather than for blind retaliation, since there is no evidence they are themselves punished yet they still punish others. They are also sensitive to efficiency: they do not punish when everyone is cooperating, and they do not escalate punishment indefinitely. Once cooperation is restored across the group, they completely halt punishment, implying they see it as a conditional intervention rather than a default behavior. Their punishment severity is moderate: they are willing to incur nontrivial personal cost but not to an extreme degree, consistent with a “calibrated enforcer” rather than a spiteful type.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThe player attends to others’ contribution levels and payoff patterns and reacts systematically. When others gain more by free-riding or by contributing less than the cooperative standard, the player responds with punishment that reduces those players’ payoffs and narrows payoff disparities. When peers contribute fully and earn similar payoffs, the player neither punishes nor deviates from cooperation, indicating satisfaction with equitable, high-cooperation outcomes. They are not observed rewarding others, but in this environment reward is unavailable, so their positive reinforcement style is unknown. Their temporary move to free-riding appears linked to observing persistent defectors and payoff advantages for them, suggesting sensitivity to perceived exploitation and a willingness to protect their own payoff if normative tools (punishment plus own cooperation) are not yet producing the desired group behavior. Once others’ outcomes align with a fair, fully cooperative profile, the player aligns fully with that pattern and refrains from any further sanctioning."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player fits a “conditional cooperative norm enforcer” type with some experimentation. They start by fully cooperating and maintain high contributions even when others contribute less, suggesting an internal norm favoring full provision rather than immediate payoff maximization. Their behavior shows conditionality over time: persistent free-riding by others coexists with their own contributions for a while, but they do test defecting themselves at least once. This defection appears temporary and strategic rather than a full shift to free-riding, as they later return to full contribution when group cooperation becomes strong again.\n\nThey do not appear purely payoff-maximizing, since they repeatedly choose the individually dominated cooperative action under a low marginal per capita return, and they pay additional costs to punish. They tolerate short-term personal losses to promote norm compliance. Fairness seems oriented around equal contributions: those who systematically give nothing while they give fully are treated as violators that justify costly action. Risk tolerance is moderate: they are willing to keep contributing even when others defect and when punishment could provoke counter-punishment (which happens once), but they do not double down aggressively after being targeted; instead, they revert to cooperation when the group converges on full contributions. Volatility is low to moderate: most of their choices follow a clear cooperative pattern with just one notable deviation into defection, suggesting learning and adjustment rather than erratic behavior.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nUnknown. There is no chat content in the transcript, so their tone, persuasion attempts, and responsiveness in communication are unobservable. It is therefore unknown whether they attempt to coordinate via messages, express norms verbally, or remain silent. Engagement/avoidance style in chat is also unknown.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThe player is clearly willing to use costly punishment and does so early and more than once. Their punishment is not indiscriminate: it appears focused on players who contribute less than they do, especially on those who consistently contribute nothing while the punisher contributes fully. This pattern is consistent with a strong inequity-aversion or norm-enforcement motive rather than spite or random aggression.\n\nThey accept substantial personal cost to reduce others’ payoffs, indicating they value enforcing contribution norms enough to sacrifice their own earnings. The punishment is not merely symbolic; they allocate enough units to impose large deductions on low contributors, in line with a deterrence motive. At the same time, they do not appear to escalate after being punished themselves; once they are personally targeted, they stop spending on punishment and shift their focus to contribution decisions. That suggests they are not primarily motivated by retaliation; when they suffer a deduction, they do not respond with counter-punishment against suspected culprits, despite having the option.\n\nOverall, their punishment use is selective, targeted at clear free-riders, and front-loaded rather than persistent. As group cooperation improves, they cease punishing entirely, which is consistent with a conditional strategy: punish to correct deviations, stop punishing when norms are followed.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey attend to others’ outcomes indirectly through adjustments in both contributions and punishment. When others who contribute nothing still receive relatively high payoffs, this player responds by imposing costly deductions on those low contributors, indicating sensitivity to perceived unjust gains. They react more strongly when someone both contributes less and ends up with higher or comparable payoffs than cooperators, which suggests concern with relative payoffs and fairness rather than only absolute efficiency.\n\nWhen others who contribute fully are also punished by someone else, this player does not step in with compensatory behavior or counter-punishment; they neither “protect” high contributors nor lash out at whoever might have punished them. This implies that while they care about punishing low contributors, they either do not infer, or do not act on, second-order norms about unfair punishment of cooperators.\n\nAfter they themselves are punished once for defecting, they immediately re-align with full contributors in the next interaction and refrain from further punishment. This is consistent with being responsive to norm-enforcing signals: when their own deviation leads to a negative outcome, they update by restoring cooperative behavior rather than retaliating. When the group converges on universal high contribution and similar payoffs for everyone, they seem satisfied and no longer adjust via punishment or strategic defection, suggesting that equal, mutually cooperative outcomes meet their goals."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a near-absolute, unconditional high contributor. They consistently give the full endowment to the public good in essentially all rounds, including after others visibly reduce their contributions and even into the last round. Only once do they contribute nothing, and they immediately revert to full contributions thereafter. Their behavior suggests a strong internal norm that “the right thing” is to contribute fully, largely independent of short-term personal payoff considerations or others’ free-riding. They show high risk tolerance with respect to potential exploitation and appear willing to be the “workhorse” of the group, treating contribution as a baseline obligation rather than a strategic lever. There is no clear evidence of conditional cooperation (they do not scale contributions down in response to others’ low contributions), nor of tit-for-tat type responses. They seem to prioritize maintaining a cooperative environment over protecting themselves from free-riding, even when it is individually costly.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nAwareness of the game horizon does not meaningfully reduce their cooperative effort. They continue to contribute fully through the final round. There is one deviation to zero contribution shortly before the very end, but it does not trigger a sustained end-game unraveling: they resume full contributions immediately and maintain them through the last round. They do not appear to adopt a typical backward-induction strategy; instead, their contribution norm remains stable despite the shrinking number of remaining rounds. This pattern suggests either that they discount the importance of the final-round logic or that they deliberately ignore it to sustain cooperation. Their reward behavior also continues at relatively high intensity near the end, rather than shutting down to maximize final payoffs. Overall, their end-game response indicates a strong preference for “finish as a cooperator,” with little evidence of strategic defection based on horizon.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey are a heavy, sometimes extreme, user of rewards. Often they spend a substantial portion of their net payoff on rewarding others, even when it leaves them with relatively low earnings. They repeatedly choose to incur costs to reinforce others’ behavior, indicating a strong willingness to use positive incentives as a central tool. Although exact recipient patterns are unknown from the summary, the timing and persistence of their spending suggest they primarily aim to support cooperators and possibly high contributors, rather than behaving randomly. They do not appear to target or discriminate via non-reward against specific low contributors; instead, their main lever is actively giving out rewards rather than withholding them. Their reward usage is not purely altruistic in payoff terms—they also receive substantial rewards in many rounds—but they continue to reward in rounds where reciprocation is uncertain or where some players clearly destroy their own payoffs, indicating that they are not just maximizing a narrow return on reward expenditures. Overall, they treat the reward mechanism as a normative and relational instrument: something one “should” use to sustain cooperation, even at personal cost.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThey are a frequent recipient of rewards and tend to keep cooperating while also continuing to spend on rewarding others. This persistence suggests they interpret being rewarded as validation of their cooperative strategy and a reason to keep both contributing and rewarding, rather than as a signal to relax effort. There is some suggestion of reciprocity in the sense that they keep investing in the mutual reward environment: when they benefit from others’ rewards, they continue to participate actively in rewarding, which likely benefits many of the same cooperators. At the same time, they do not appear to specifically “pay back” any one individual and then stop; their pattern looks more like generalized reciprocity or group-level reinforcement than dyadic alliance-building. They do not noticeably retaliate against those who stop rewarding them, nor do they withhold contributions in response; their primary response to being rewarded appears to be to stay the course as a high contributor and active rewarder.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey closely attend to the reward structure and others’ payoff patterns, but react in a prosocial rather than punitive way. When others sacrifice significant amounts to reward cooperators, this player does not mirror the self-harming extremes some players reach; instead, they maintain a relatively high yet more bounded level of reward spending, indicating some implicit attention to efficiency even while being generous. There is no evidence that they respond to free-riders or low contributors with punishment (not available) or with sharp withdrawal of contributions. Nor do they appear to deliberately exploit high rewarders by free-riding on contributions; instead, they continue to contribute fully even when others are clearly spending heavily on rewards. They tolerate considerable inequality in outcomes: they persist in contributing and rewarding despite some players burning large amounts of coins or others earning very high payoffs from being rewarded. Their behavior suggests they value the group’s cooperative structure and the ongoing positive-sum dynamic over individual payoff envy or resentment. They seem comfortable “subsidizing” the group’s welfare and rewarding high contributors, even if that means accepting that some others earn more than they do.\n\nOverall, this player’s type is a highly cooperative, norm-driven rewarder: they prioritize full cooperation and substantial positive reinforcement, show little inclination to defect even when exploited or near the end of the game, and appear motivated by sustaining a cooperative environment more than by maximizing their own short-term earnings."

They always contribute the full endowment in every round, with no visible adjustment in response to others’ free-riding, mid-level contributions, or changing group averages. They appear to operate under a firm internal norm that “the right thing” is to fully cooperate, independent of short-term payoff considerations. There is no evidence of conditional cooperation (they do not reduce contributions even when many others give little or nothing), nor of strategic end-game defection. Risk tolerance regarding exploitation is high: they consistently expose themselves to being taken advantage of but do not flinch. This pattern indicates a strong, stable fairness ideal centered on their own behavior rather than on matching others.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nAwareness of the finite horizon does not change their cooperative behavior. They continue to contribute the maximum amount through the final rounds, including when many others begin to contribute less or zero. They do not exhibit the typical decay in cooperation toward the end, nor do they switch to short-term self-interest when only a few rounds remain. Their reward behavior also remains active and costly in late rounds, suggesting they are not focused on final-round payoff maximization. Overall, horizon length has little observable effect: their strategy is rule-based and stable rather than dynamically optimized around the game’s endpoint.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey are a frequent and heavy user of reward, often spending a large portion of their payoff to grant others relatively modest net benefits. They are willing to incur substantial personal cost to reward others, even when it leaves them with very low payoffs, so they are clearly not narrowly payoff-maximizing. The primary apparent trigger for rewarding is contribution level: they systematically direct more reward toward players who are consistently contributing high or full amounts, and they tend to withhold or minimize reward for persistently low contributors. They sometimes continue rewarding even in environments where many others are cutting back or where they themselves are not being generously rewarded, suggesting that they treat reward partly as a normative signal (“this is good behavior”) rather than a purely strategic incentive. However, their reward intensity fluctuates: there are periods where they reward many targets heavily and periods where they reward no one, which may reflect fatigue, reassessment of effectiveness, or temporary attempts to conserve payoff, though the exact motive is unknown.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThey do receive substantial rewards from some group members at various times. Their own reward allocations are often broadly spread among high cooperators rather than narrowly targeted to only those who have rewarded them most; this suggests that “you cooperated” is a stronger criterion than “you rewarded me.” There is some alignment between generous rewarders and their own reward targets, consistent with weak or partial reciprocity, but they do not clearly form exclusive alliances or stable reward cliques. When they stop rewarding for stretches and then resume, the resumption is again mainly tied to cooperation levels, not obviously to recent personal gains. Overall, they show limited direct tit-for-tat reciprocity toward individual rewarders; they behave more like a pro-social norm enforcer than a coalition builder.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey pay attention to others’ contributions and resulting outcomes, and their reward patterns track both contribution behavior and, to a lesser extent, how others are using the reward mechanism. High-contribution players who also spend to reward others are especially likely to receive reinforcement from them, which suggests they value “pro-social leadership” (contributors who also invest in the public good via reward). Conversely, chronic low contributors or those who benefit disproportionately without incurring comparable reward costs are rarely favored by them. They do not employ negative sanctioning (no punishment option exists) and do not attempt to offset inequities by withholding their own contribution; instead they respond via reward allocation or by pausing reward while still contributing fully. They appear tolerant of payoff inequality when it arises from others’ strategic spending, but they continuously try to nudge the group toward cooperative norms by selectively boosting those whose actions support the public good. Personality-wise, they come across as principled, strongly prosocial, and stubbornly cooperative, with a willingness to self-sacrifice in pursuit of a high-cooperation, high-reward environment."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a flexible, opportunistic contributor who mixes medium cooperation with episodes of near-complete free-riding. They alternate between contributing roughly half of their endowment and contributing almost nothing, with occasional token amounts. Their behavior suggests they want to benefit from the public good without being the worst contributor, and they sometimes match or slightly undercut the prevailing contribution norm rather than either leading cooperation or fully exploiting it.\n\nThey show moderate responsiveness to group behavior: when they are heavily targeted by punishment after low contributions, they reliably jump back up to mid-level contributions in subsequent rounds. When punishment pressure eases, they are willing to return to low or minimal giving, indicating conditional cooperation driven by sanctions more than by an internal fairness norm. They do not insist on perfectly equal contributions; instead, they appear comfortable contributing less than many others as long as punishment risk remains manageable.\n\nTheir risk tolerance is moderate: they do at times take the risk of very low contributions even after previous costly sanctions, but they do not escalate to extreme, consistent defection once they see that sanctions can be severe. Instead they oscillate, suggesting a willingness to “test” how much free-riding is tolerable, then retreat toward the group norm when sanctions become intense.\n\nOverall, this is a sanction-sensitive, strategic free-rider: not a pure defector, but someone who prefers contributing less than cooperative peers and adjusts upward primarily in response to observed costs rather than intrinsic commitment to fairness.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nAwareness of the finite horizon does not produce a simple monotonic decay in cooperation. Instead, the player continues their pattern of alternating between mid-range contributions and very low contributions through the later part of the game. Even very late, they sometimes cooperate at moderate levels and sometimes free-ride, rather than converging on full defection.\n\nSevere punishment episodes near the end are followed immediately by higher, more cooperative contributions, indicating that direct payoff feedback matters more to them than abstract end-game logic. They do not appear to adopt a final-round “grab everything” policy; they are still willing to contribute almost nothing in some late rounds but also still return to medium contributions after that. This suggests that, although they can see how many rounds remain, their horizon awareness is weaker than their short-run response to sanctions.\n\nIn summary, their end-game behavior is best described as continuing sanction-driven conditional cooperation with opportunistic dips, rather than a deliberate backward-induction collapse of contributions.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThis player never uses the punishment mechanism, despite multiple opportunities and despite being a repeated target of costly sanctions themselves. They absorb substantial deductions without retaliating or attempting to discipline low contributors, suggesting a strong reluctance to spend their own resources on norm enforcement.\n\nTheir non-use of punishment persists across cooperative and non-cooperative phases, indicating a stable trait rather than a situational oversight. This aligns with a payoff-maximizing stance toward the second-order public good: they treat punishment as an unnecessary cost, even when it might deter future sanctions against themselves or stabilize cooperation. There is no evidence of anger-driven retaliation, moralistic punishment, or targeted norm enforcement; their motives appear purely first-order (own payoff from contributions and redistributions), not second-order (shaping others’ behavior via punishment).\n\nTheir type is therefore “non-punishing, sanction-sensitive free-rider”: they respond to being punished by adjusting contributions but never themselves invest in punishing others."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is primarily a strategic free-rider with occasional full cooperation when it appears individually safe or when they are experimenting. They face a binary choice each round and overwhelmingly choose not to contribute. They do fully contribute only in a small minority of rounds, and those cooperative moves do not persist; they revert back to keeping their entire endowment. Their behavior suggests they understand that, given the group’s multiplier, not contributing is individually profitable when others are willing to contribute.\n\nTheir contribution pattern is piecewise stable: they often maintain the same choice across several consecutive rounds rather than switching erratically. This indicates a basic strategy rather than random play. When others contribute reliably, they mostly exploit that by free-riding, only occasionally joining in. There is no evidence that they follow a fairness norm like “match others’ average” or “contribute whenever others do”; they clearly tolerate benefiting from others’ contributions while not sharing the cost.\n\nRisk tolerance in contributions appears low to moderate: they do not repeatedly “test” high cooperation nor do they sacrifice much payoff to try to build a fully cooperative norm. When they do contribute fully, it seems more like isolated probes or short-lived shifts than a sustained attempt to change the group dynamic. They show no clear sensitivity to marginal changes in others’ contributions: cooperative bursts from others do not systematically induce them to cooperate in return. Overall, their baseline is non-contribution, with cooperation as a temporary deviation rather than a guiding principle.\n\n<REWARD>\nThis player almost never spends on rewards, even though rewards are individually cost-neutral in this setting.

This suggests that even when rewarding is not costly in net payoff terms, they are reluctant to give up control over their own coins or to take on the active role of “enforcer” or “encourager.” They appear payoff-focused in the narrow sense of keeping their own coins in hand rather than using them to shape others’ behavior.\n\nOnly once do they engage in substantial rewarding, and that occurs at a moment when they themselves are cooperating. On that occasion, they invest nontrivially in rewards while contributing fully. This indicates that they can, in principle, use rewards to reinforce cooperation, but they do so rarely and only when already in a cooperative mindset. The timing suggests that their motive may be strategic reinforcement (trying to sustain or reward a cooperative subgroup) rather than pure altruistic generosity, but this is uncertain.\n\nThey show no evidence of using small, frequent rewards as a running signal of approval or gratitude to consistent cooperators. They also do not use rewards as a tool to compensate those who previously rewarded them; their large reward action is not a direct tit-for-tat to the specific players who had rewarded them earlier, at least not in a clearly traceable way from the transcript. Overall, their default is to withhold rewards, even from high contributors, and to treat the reward mechanism as something to be activated only under special circumstances.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nWhen others reward this player, there is no clear pattern of reciprocal reward directed back at those individuals, and no consistent increase in their own contributions that could be interpreted as sustained gratitude-based cooperation. After being rewarded, they do not reliably become more cooperative in the subsequent rounds, nor do they begin rewarding in a systematic way. At best, there is one episode later in the game where they both contribute and reward, but it is not clearly targeted reciprocation toward identified past rewarders; it looks more like a standalone cooperative-rewarding episode rather than a stable alliance response.\n\nThey therefore do not appear to build alliances or conditional partnerships based on being rewarded. Identification of rewarders does not, in observable behavior, lead them to single those players out for payback rewards or consistent mutual support. Any internal feeling of gratitude is behaviorally weak or absent: their choices show that being rewarded does not strongly reshape their strategy.\n\nOverall, their response profile is: being rewarded has limited and short-lived impact on their actions. They are willing to accept rewards without reliably adjusting their behavior in favor of the rewarder. They act more like an opportunistic recipient than a reciprocity-driven partner, and they do not seem to treat the reward channel as the basis for long-term coalition-building or norm enforcement."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a selective, payoff-focused contributor who alternates between full free-riding, full cooperation, and moderate giving. They clearly understand that contributing nothing is individually profitable when others give enough, and they are willing to exploit that. At the same time, they also repeatedly make high or full contributions, indicating that they are not a pure free-rider.\n\nTheir contributions cluster into three modes: zero, moderate, and full. They do not gradually drift up or down; rather, they switch between these modes across the game. This suggests deliberate experimentation and conditionality rather than random noise. They seem to test how much they can keep while still benefiting from others’ generosity, then periodically return to high contributions when the group is cooperative and the public good is lucrative.\n\nThey do not appear to follow a strict “tit-for-tat” or simple threshold rule based only on others’ immediate behavior. Instead, they act in a more opportunistic but not fully exploitative manner: they exploit high-contributing environments at times by giving nothing, but at other times they match or exceed the group’s average by giving heavily. There is no evidence that they care about maintaining exact fairness or proportionality between their own contribution and others’; they tolerate being above or below typical peers when it suits their payoff.\n\nThey exhibit low risk aversion with respect to the public good: they are willing to contribute fully in a group that has a mix of high and low contributors, even without guarantees of reciprocity or protection via punishment. However, they are not locked into a cooperative identity; when they see that they can earn high payoffs by free-riding on a generous group, they do so. Overall, they behave as a strategic, flexible contributor whose primary reference point is individual payoff rather than a stable fairness norm.\n\n<REWARD>\nThis player never spends any resources on rewarding others, despite multiple opportunities and many high contributors around them. They consistently choose to keep all their payoff rather than invest in reinforcing cooperative behavior. This holds in both cooperative and more mixed-contribution environments, so it appears to be a stable strategic choice rather than a situational lapse.\n\nThey receive nontrivial rewards from others on several occasions, including when they themselves cooperate and when they free-ride. Despite this, they do not reciprocate by rewarding anyone. This indicates that they do not use the reward mechanism to express gratitude, build reciprocity, or support group norms. They treat peer rewards as a windfall rather than as part of a mutual exchange.\n\nThere is no sign that they try to steer the group through strategic rewarding (for example, by selectively rewarding high contributors to maintain a cooperative equilibrium). The efficiency of the reward technology does not induce them to use it; they appear to judge the private cost as not worth the social benefit, or they do not believe their unseen rewards would change others’ behavior in a way that benefits them.\n\nIn terms of type, they function as a “non-rewarding beneficiary”: they accept rewards and the higher payoffs provided by strong contributors but do not spend on rewarding themselves. They place clear priority on conserving their own resources, even when a small cost could support or encourage highly cooperative partners.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThis player observes others’ contributions and the sometimes extreme reward expenditures by a subset of very prosocial or erratic peers, yet they do not adjust by rewarding or by stabilizing at a consistently cooperative level. They willingly allow some others to incur very large reward costs and to transfer substantial benefits to the group (including to themselves) without contributing to that reward system.\n\nThey do not appear to punish or retaliate against low contributors via the reward tool (for example, by withholding reward for defectors while supporting cooperators), since they never reward anyone at all. Instead, their response to others’ behavior is expressed only through their own contribution level. When others are broadly cooperative and the public good is high, they sometimes join them with high contributions and sometimes revert to free-riding, accepting large payoffs and even additional rewards targeted at them.\n\nThey show tolerance for large payoff disparities and for others making seemingly irrational or self-sacrificing reward choices. There is no behavioral reaction that suggests moral outrage, attempts to correct “wasteful” rewarders, or efforts to protect naive altruists. They simply integrate these outcomes into their private payoff calculus and continue playing in a self-oriented way.\n\nIn new PGG environments, this type is best described as a payoff-driven, non-reciprocating conditional cooperator: they are willing to contribute when it is profitable or when the group environment is strongly cooperative, but they do not invest in maintaining that environment through reward, and they are comfortable benefiting from others’ costly prosocial actions without directly reinforcing them."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a flexible, mixed contributor who alternates between very low and very high contributions rather than locking into a single level. They sometimes free‑ride almost completely, sometimes contribute fully, and often choose moderate amounts. Their behavior suggests they do not follow a strict “always cooperate” or “always defect” rule. Instead, they appear to probe the environment and adjust.\n\nThey show a willingness to contribute substantially when others seem generally cooperative and when high group contributions appear to yield strong payoffs. At the same time, they are comfortable contributing very little even when others contribute a lot, so they do not operate under a strong fairness or equality norm. They tolerate being a low contributor among high contributors if it benefits them, indicating relatively low inequity aversion toward being better off than others.\n\nTheir choices appear somewhat conditional but also noisy: they do not simply “match” the group average; they oscillate. This suggests they are exploring how much they can free‑ride without collapsing group cooperation, rather than strictly following a tit‑for‑tat or proportional rule. They show no clear effort to stabilize contributions at a particular cooperative norm.\n\nIn terms of risk, they accept payoff variability: they sometimes invest fully despite uncertainty about others, and sometimes hold back sharply even when it might reduce future rewards from others. This points to either experimentation or a lack of a fixed, payoff‑maximizing plan, rather than a consistently risk‑averse or risk‑seeking profile.\n\nOverall, they fit a “strategic but opportunistic cooperator” type: willing to support the public good when it looks profitable or sustainable, but quite ready to under‑contribute and exploit cooperative surroundings when they believe they can get away with it.\n\n<REWARD>\nThis player reliably spends on the reward mechanism; they use it in most rounds rather than ignoring it. However, they rarely invest heavily in reward, typically spending small amounts, with only occasional higher spending. This pattern suggests that they like having the lever of reward and use it as a fine‑tuning tool rather than as a central strategy.\n\nThey appear to aim reward at reinforcing cooperation and possibly at reciprocating when they themselves receive benefits, but the evidence on exact targets is unknown because identities of rewarders are hidden. What is clear is that they continue to pay for reward even in periods when they are personally doing well and even when they themselves receive no visible reward in that round. This implies they do not treat reward purely as simple one‑shot reciprocation; instead, they seem to be trying to shape or sustain a cooperative climate over time.\n\nThey do not appear to escalate into extreme reward spending, unlike some group members. They keep their costs moderate, suggesting they are conscious of their own payoff and treat reward as an investment with bounded cost, rather than an expression of pure altruism. This is consistent with a “strategic rewarder” who uses positive incentives but still monitors personal returns.\n\nTheir use of reward is consistent even when their own contributions are low. This indicates that they might reward “good citizens” of the group even when they themselves choose to free‑ride, suggesting a separation between how they behave and how they would like others to behave. That pattern fits a type who tries to steer others toward higher cooperation while personally exploiting that cooperation at times.\n\nThey never completely abandon the reward tool after observing others’ reward behavior; instead, they adapt the intensity (sometimes zero, sometimes low, sometimes a bit higher). This suggests ongoing learning and experimentation with incentive strategies rather than a fixed rule.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThis player pays attention to others’ outcomes and adjusts behavior in ways consistent with observing both contributions and reward expenditures. They continue to contribute non‑zero amounts and keep rewarding even after seeing some extreme behaviors by others (such as players spending so much on rewards that they severely hurt their own payoffs). This indicates that they are not easily “scared off” by others’ apparent irrationality; instead, they remain focused on their own payoff and on using available tools.\n\nThey show no clear pattern of directly punishing low contributors via withholding all reward, but they do reduce their own spending on reward at times when the group appears to be rewarding heavily or when strong cooperative norms seem already supported by others. This suggests that they may rely on others’ reward spending to enforce norms when possible, allowing them to conserve coins. In that sense, they are somewhat second‑order free‑riding on others’ incentive efforts.\n\nThey do not visibly overreact to high earners or low earners; there is no evidence of envy‑driven behavior (e.g., cutting contributions drastically just because others earn more) or spite (e.g., attempting to undermine those who earn well). Their own payoff remains reasonably strong despite occasional costly rewards and variable contributions, suggesting that they monitor the payoff structure and keep themselves in a comfortable range.\n\nWhen they see that some players pour large amounts into rewards, they do not join in large‑scale rewarding; instead, they maintain or modestly adjust their own small‑to‑medium reward levels. This hints at a belief that the group will remain cooperative without them needing to sacrifice excessively. They allow others to shoulder the heavy “norm‑enforcement” burden.\n\nAs contributions from others remain generally high throughout, this player does not shift into aggressive defection. They keep mixing moderate and high contributions, implying that the sight of sustained group cooperation and large reward flows reassures them that cooperation is stable enough to continue benefiting from, whether they are contributing a lot or a little in each specific round.\n\nOverall, their response to others’ outcomes is measured and opportunistic: they use information about others’ contributions and spending primarily to fine‑tune their own mix of contribution and reward, aiming to secure good personal payoffs in an environment where others seem willing to support the public good and to invest in incentives."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a flexible, payoff-attentive conditional cooperator with a significant free-riding streak. They do not fix on a single contribution level; instead they shift between full defection, mid-level contributions, and full cooperation, apparently experimenting with what yields good payoffs in the prevailing environment. They are clearly not driven by a strong fairness or equality norm: they are willing to contribute nothing while taking a large share of the common return, and they accept being a net beneficiary from high-contributing others without compensating.\n\nTheir behavior suggests that they watch the group’s contribution climate and respond to it, but only loosely. They are willing to contribute the maximum amount when many others are also contributing high amounts and when the public good appears profitable. At other times they reduce contributions to a moderate level or drop to zero, especially when they can still anticipate high redistributed payoffs from others’ generosity. This points to a risk-aware but opportunistic approach: they prefer to avoid being the “sucker” who contributes much while others give little, and they exploit situations where others’ cooperation is already strong.\n\nThey do not show a clear linear “tit-for-tat” style or a stable threshold rule; instead, they seem to be balancing two motives: (1) maintaining decent group provision when it looks robust, and (2) securing high personal payoffs when an opportunity to free-ride is obvious. Across the game, they demonstrate adaptation: they move from initial defection to substantial contributions once they have seen that others are often generous, and later they intersperse cooperative and noncooperative moves as they probe what the group will sustain. Their risk tolerance appears moderate: they are willing to invest fully in the public good at times, but not consistently and not in a way that would protect against exploitation by defectors.\n\n<REWARD>\nThis player is a very sparse and selective rewarder. Most of the time they choose not to spend on rewards at all, even when others are clearly contributing heavily or rewarding others. When they do reward, they spend small, one-off amounts that are unlikely to have a major influence on others’ payoffs. Their rare use of the reward mechanism suggests that they do not view rewarding as a core strategic tool, even though it is efficiency-enhancing.\n\nThe few instances of rewarding indicate that they are more inclined to use reward to lightly acknowledge or encourage cooperative behavior, rather than to build sustained reciprocal ties. There is no evidence that they systematically track who previously rewarded them or who consistently contributes high amounts; instead, their rewards look more like occasional, low-cost signals rather than part of a structured reciprocity strategy. They appear motivated primarily by personal payoff maximization and see reward as a secondary, situational option rather than a central lever.\n\nThey also do not engage in retaliatory or corrective reward patterns (such as “rewarding to offset others’ apparent losses” or “rewarding those attacked by others”). Overall, their willingness to incur costs for others is low and intermittent, and their reward behavior is neither strongly strategic nor strongly prosocial. If they believe reward can nudge others, they are cautious and minimal in using it.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThis player is observant of others’ contributions and outcomes but reacts mainly through their own contribution choices, not through sustained reward-based responses. When others as a group are highly cooperative, they sometimes align by contributing substantially themselves, indicating that they take positive group outcomes as a cue that cooperation is safe and profitable. In other periods, even when others continue to contribute well, they revert to low or zero contributions and rely on the group’s efforts, implying they are comfortable benefitting from others’ sacrifices.\n\nThey do not appear to be strongly moved by extreme behaviors such as very large reward expenditures or very unequal payoffs for others. Even when some players sacrifice significant amounts to reward cooperators, this player does not systematically step in to support those rewarders or to reinforce the same targets. Nor do they compensate players whose payoffs are driven down by heavy reward spending. This suggests a relatively low concern for redistributive justice or for stabilizing others’ positions; their focus is on their own earnings and the general level of group provision, not on correcting individual imbalances.\n\nThey also show no discernible pattern of gratitude: being rewarded themselves does not reliably trigger either higher contributions in the following behavior or reciprocal rewarding toward others. Likewise, they do not use their decisions to “send messages” about others’ reward use; they neither mirror nor counteract the reward patterns of others in a consistent way. Their learning appears mainly outcome-based at the aggregate level: they infer that the group can sustain high payoffs and then sometimes join in with higher contributions, but they do not fine-tune their behavior in response to specific individuals’ outcomes or costs. In personality terms, this points to a pragmatic, relatively impersonal style: attentive to the general incentive environment, but emotionally and normatively detached from others’ individual fortunes."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a strongly payoff-focused, flexible free-rider who occasionally experiments with high cooperation. Their default contribution is very low relative to others; they often put in almost nothing while enjoying the group returns. Periodically they switch to full or high contribution, but these bursts do not persist and do not anchor to a stable pattern of reciprocity. Instead, contributions oscillate between extremes (near-zero and full endowment), indicating exploratory or opportunistic behavior rather than a stable fairness norm.\n\nThey appear to treat the public good primarily as a vehicle for personal profit: when others are contributing strongly, they are comfortable contributing little and taking the high payoff. They do not consistently “reward” cooperative rounds by raising their own contribution in subsequent rounds, nor do they systematically withhold contributions in response to lower group contributions. Their changes are better described as occasional tests or mood-like shifts rather than predictable conditional cooperation.\n\nThey do not show clear aversion to being a low contributor in a cooperative group. There is no visible attempt to match the group average or to align with a perceived fairness standard. Any high-contribution choices seem more like temporary deviations than expressions of a stable cooperative identity. Risk tolerance appears moderate: they are willing to invest fully at times, but because they pair this with little or no use of rewards, these investments look more like simple exploitation of the high-multiplier environment than like strategic attempts to shift the group.\n\nOverall, their type is best summarized as a profit-maximizing, conditionally exploratory free-rider with sporadic cooperative spikes and weak commitment to norms of proportional contribution.\n\n<REWARD>\nThis player is almost entirely non-rewarding, despite operating in an environment where others actively use rewards. They never spend on rewards themselves, even in periods when they contribute a lot and many others are also cooperating. They do accept rewards from others and benefit substantially from them, but they do not reciprocate, even toward clearly generous or supportive co-players.\n\nThis non-use of reward holds both when they free-ride and when they contribute fully. There is no instance of them using reward to reinforce high contributors, to encourage low contributors to improve, or to thank those who have rewarded them. They appear either uninterested in the social or strategic function of reward or explicitly unwilling to pay the personal cost involved.\n\nTheir stance suggests that they prioritize their own payoff over building or maintaining cooperative structures via costly prosocial actions. They treat rewards purely as windfalls provided by others, not as part of a reciprocal exchange or a coordination device. They do not use reward to shape others’ behavior or to cultivate allies, even though many others around them are engaging in such strategies.\n\nThus, their reward behavior is characterized by complete passivity: they are a beneficiary but not a contributor to the reward system, and they show no visible inclination to invest in others’ welfare or in long-run cooperative stability through positive incentives.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThis player observes others’ outcomes but does not visibly adjust their own behavior to support or sanction anyone. They see multiple instances of strong contribution, heavy reward-spending, and large or small payoffs across co-players, yet they keep their own reward use at zero and do not establish clear, consistent contingencies in their own contributions.\n\nThey do not appear to “rescue” over-generous players who sacrifice large portions of their payoff to reward others. They also do not target especially cooperative contributors with extra support, nor do they respond to dramatic shifts in others’ payoffs by changing their own pattern. High or low outcomes for others are effectively treated as background information rather than as signals that call for action.\n\nAt the same time, they continue to accept substantial net benefits from the group: they often free-ride in periods when others are shouldering the cooperative and reward burdens, and they accept incoming rewards without reciprocation. This combination suggests that they interpret others’ generosity as exploitable rather than as something that obliges them to respond in kind.\n\nThere is no evidence that they try to align their behavior with those who are doing especially well or especially poorly, nor that they attempt to punish or discourage free-riders through contribution changes or rewards. Learning and adaptation appear limited: although their contribution levels sometimes change, these shifts do not map cleanly onto observed changes in others’ payoffs or reward expenditures. The player thus presents as a largely self-referential, low-engagement actor with respect to others’ outcomes—observant enough to exploit a cooperative environment, but not engaged enough to co-create or sustain that environment through responsive actions."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a low, volatile contributor who occasionally makes brief cooperative surges. Across the game, their typical contribution level is small relative to the endowment and to the group, with multiple minimal or zero contributions interspersed with a few full or high contributions. They do not follow a simple monotonic pattern (neither steady decay nor steady increase); instead, they alternate between free-riding and sizable giving, suggesting experimentation or opportunistic adjustment rather than a fixed norm.\n\nTheir behavior is conditionally responsive to others’ cooperation. After observing very high average contributions and generous use of rewards in the group, they sometimes jump to high contributions, but they do not maintain that level once they have confirmed that they can earn strong payoffs while contributing little. The pattern suggests they understand that contributing little while others give a lot is profitable and are willing to exploit that situation. At the same time, occasional high contributions indicate they are not purely selfish in a static sense; they sometimes act as if testing or reinforcing a cooperative regime, then revert when high cooperation appears stable without their full participation.\n\nThey do not appear to follow a strict fairness norm. They are willing to contribute far less than heavy contributors while still accepting the shared returns from the public pool, and they show no consistent effort to match or proportionally track others’ contributions. This implies limited concern for contribution equality, at least when it trades off with their own earnings.\n\nRisk tolerance in contribution choices appears moderate. They are willing at times to risk the cost of full contribution in a large group with mixed behavior, but because they quickly revert to small contributions even when cooperation is strong, the default seems to be a cautious, payoff-protecting stance: they mostly keep private coins safe and only occasionally stake them on the public good.\n\n<REWARD>\nThis player is a light, selective rewarder who uses rewards sparingly and with no clear pattern of systematic reinforcement. In most rounds, they do not spend anything on rewards. When they do spend, it is always at the minimum nonzero level available and directed at a very small number of recipients. This reveals a reluctance to bear substantial personal cost for shaping others’ behavior.\n\nThey appear more willing to reward when group cooperation is already high or rising and when they themselves have contributed at least something. In those situations, they sometimes spend a bit to reward, which is consistent with a weak form of conditional cooperation: they are willing to pay slightly to acknowledge or support a cooperative environment but not to drive it from scratch. The small, infrequent expenditures suggest they view reward primarily as a minor tweak rather than a central strategic tool.\n\nThere is no consistent evidence that they target either extreme cooperators or specific individuals over time; given anonymity of rewarders, any such targeting cannot be inferred with confidence. Whether they use reward to express gratitude, to encourage particular partners, or simply to “do a small good” is unknown. Overall, they value their own payoff more than the potential future gains from strategic, large-scale rewarding.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThis player closely observes that others frequently contribute much more and often engage in very heavy rewarding, sometimes to the point of significantly lowering their own payoffs. Their own behavior indicates that they do not imitate these extremes. Instead, they continue to play in a comparatively self-protective, low-cost way even when others incur large expenses on rewards.\n\nThey do not ramp up contributions or reward spending in response to other players sacrificing a lot for the group, suggesting limited reciprocity toward high-cost cooperators. At the same time, they also do not retaliate against low contributors (punishment is unavailable) nor respond with increased contributions when apparent “free-riders” are rewarded by others. They simply maintain or return to their preferred low-contribution, low-reward pattern after brief experiments with higher giving.\n\nThis points to a mindset where others’ outcomes serve more as background information than as strong behavioral triggers. They notice the environment is generally cooperative and that some players are willing to spend heavily on rewarding, but they treat this mainly as an opportunity to secure good payoffs with modest personal sacrifice. Their adaptation over time reflects learning about what the group tolerates and what yields high earnings for them, rather than a strong normative response to fairness, altruistic sacrifice, or gratitude. Their social style thus appears pragmatic, mildly conditional, and only weakly influenced by others’ costs or extreme generosity."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a conditional, payoff-sensitive contributor who mixes cooperation and free-riding rather than committing to a single mode. They are clearly willing to contribute fully to the public good at many points, but they also repeatedly choose to contribute nothing even when others continue to contribute. Their pattern shows that they do not follow a simple “always cooperate” norm; instead, they appear to compare the private payoff from free-riding against the shared payoff from joint contribution and are willing to exploit cooperative others when it is lucrative.\n\nTheir contribution behavior is moderately volatile: they switch several times between full contribution and zero contribution across the game instead of settling quickly into a single stable choice. However, they are not random: stretches of sustained full contribution alternate with stretches of sustained free-riding, suggesting they update based on perceived trends in the group or on recent payoff experiences rather than round-by-round emotional reactions.\n\nThey do not enforce strict fairness norms. They continue to contribute in the presence of at least one persistent free-rider and do not systematically withdraw cooperation in direct proportion to others’ selfishness. At the same time, they also free-ride even when multiple others are cooperating, indicating that “if others are fair, I must also be fair” is not a binding rule for them. Instead, their fairness concern is either weak or consistently overridden by payoff considerations.\n\nRisk tolerance appears moderate. They are willing to be the only or one of very few contributors in some rounds, exposing themselves to the risk of low redistribution when others do not join. Yet they also protect themselves at times by switching to free-riding, especially after experiencing scenarios in which contributing yields relatively poor private payoffs compared to free-riding under similar group behavior. This pattern suggests a player who recognizes the strategic risk of unilateral cooperation and is willing to take it sometimes, but not in a rigid or idealistic way.\n\nOverall, their contribution “type” is a flexible, opportunistic cooperator: inclined to cooperate when it seems worthwhile or when others are joining in, but ready to revert to self-interested free-riding to secure high individual payoffs and to avoid bearing the cost of sustaining cooperation alone.\n\n<REWARD>\nThe player never spends any resources on rewarding others, despite having multiple opportunities and despite being paired with clear, observable cooperative behavior from specific group members. This consistent absence of reward behavior suggests that they either assign negligible value to rewarding as an instrument for sustaining cooperation or they strictly prioritize keeping their own payoff over any attempt to shape others’ behavior through positive incentives.\n\nThey do receive rewards from others at several points, but this does not induce them to start rewarding anyone in return. There is no evidence that receiving rewards triggers gratitude-based reciprocation in the reward channel. They do not engage in “strategic reinforcement” of particular partners either; for example, they never select a consistently high-contributing partner to encourage with rewards, even when that partner’s behavior is easily identifiable and potentially valuable to sustain.\n\nGiven that the cost and benefit of reward are symmetric here, their complete abstention from rewarding likely reflects a belief that reward is either ineffective, not worth the effort, or simply dominated by focusing on one’s own contributions and free-riding decisions. They may also view reward as redundant in an environment where contributions are already visible and where they can respond directly by adjusting their own contributions rather than by spending on side-payments.\n\nIn sum, they are a non-rewarder: they do not use the reward option for altruistic, reciprocal, or strategic reasons, and they treat reward as an unnecessary or inefficient instrument in this setting.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nWhen others reward them, the player does not mirror that behavior through direct rewarding, but they do at times change their contribution behavior in ways that are compatible with some degree of responsiveness. After receiving a reward, they sometimes move from free-riding to contributing, or they maintain a cooperative stance for a while. However, they also later revert to free-riding even after having been rewarded multiple times, indicating that any positive response to being rewarded is partial and unstable.\n\nThey do not single out identifiable rewarders for special treatment through contributions. Because all players’ contributions are public, it is possible in principle for them to form an “alliance” with those who both contribute and reward them. Yet their subsequent behavior toward such partners remains mixed: they sometimes cooperate alongside cooperative others, and sometimes exploit them by free-riding, even when those same partners have previously rewarded them. There is no visible pattern of targeted reciprocity toward specific rewarders.\n\nThis suggests that their primary response to being rewarded is not gratitude or alliance-building but, at most, a weak and temporary adjustment in overall cooperation level that is dominated by payoff considerations and by their reading of the wider group pattern. They appear to treat being rewarded as a pleasant but non-binding signal: it may briefly coincide with higher contributions, but it does not anchor long-term loyalty or create a robust reciprocal bond with the rewarder."

They are clearly willing to contribute the entire endowment and do so repeatedly, which rules out a pure selfish or purely risk-averse type. At the same time, they also repeatedly choose not to contribute even when others are contributing, so they are not a strict unconditional cooperator either.\n\nTheir cooperation appears loosely conditional on the surrounding contribution climate and on their own recent experience, but the condition is not rigid: they sometimes cooperate when others are mostly defecting and sometimes defect when at least one or two others cooperate. This suggests they are not a strict “tit-for-tat” or pure matching type, but rather someone who is experimenting between cooperative and exploitative options to see which pattern yields better returns.\n\nThey seem comfortable with payoff risk: they contribute in situations where it is already evident that at least some group members contribute zero, so they do not require unanimous cooperation before pitching in. They also appear to tolerate inequality to their own disadvantage: they keep contributing after experiencing being the only or one of the few contributors, and they do not systematically withdraw cooperation in all such cases.\n\nNormatively, they seem to hold a weak fairness norm in favor of higher contributions: they repeatedly match or exceed the highest cooperative standard that exists in the group, but they do not maintain that standard consistently or enforce it through their own behavior when others fall short.

The single instance of rewarding behavior is an exception rather than a pattern, which indicates that prosocial reinforcement is not a central part of their strategy.\n\nWhen they do reward, it appears targeted at someone who is clearly cooperating relative to others, suggesting that, in principle, they recognize and are willing to positively reinforce above-baseline cooperation. However, the fact that this rewarding action does not repeat later, even when similarly cooperative peers are present, suggests that the earlier reward is either a one-time experiment with the mechanism or a transient impulse rather than a stable preference.\n\nThe cost and benefit of reward are symmetric in this environment, so the material calculus is neutral: not rewarding does not directly improve their payoff relative to rewarding, except to avoid the transaction altogether. Their near-complete avoidance of reward therefore looks more like a preference to minimize effort or complexity, or a belief that reward has little impact on others’ future behavior, than like a finely tuned payoff-maximization response to the cost structure.\n\nThey do not use reward as a systematic tool to shape group norms, build alliances, or express ongoing gratitude. There is no evidence of reward-based reciprocity loops (rewarding those who rewarded them or systematically rewarding loyal cooperators). Overall, their reward behavior is best characterized as “low-engagement, occasional, and non-strategic.”\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nWhen they receive rewards, they continue to contribute at high levels in many subsequent decisions, but the pattern of contributions around rewarded episodes does not clearly differ from their overall mixed contribution strategy. This makes it hard to infer strong reward responsiveness: they neither sharply increase nor clearly decrease cooperation immediately in response to being rewarded. Thus, their behavioral reaction to being rewarded is ambiguous and likely weak.\n\nThey do not visibly reciprocate toward identifiable rewarders via the reward mechanism itself: there is no consistent pattern of sending rewards back to those who previously rewarded them, nor of preferentially rewarding particular high-contribution partners over time. This suggests that, in this setting, they do not treat reward as a vehicle for building bilateral alliances or for symbolic reciprocity.\n\nTheir contributions do remain generally compatible with cooperation in environments where other players are offering at least some cooperation. Being rewarded does not trigger retaliation, defensiveness, or withdrawal; at minimum, they tolerate being singled out with rewards and continue to play in a way that can benefit the group. That said, because they also continue to defect in some later periods after having been rewarded, any reciprocity norm they hold appears weak or overshadowed by their own payoff experimentation and opportunistic swings between cooperation and free-riding.\n\nIn terms of social style, they come across as relatively detached: they acknowledge rewards passively through continued participation in the public good but do not actively “answer” them through the available reward channel. Their primary lever for responding to the social environment seems to be whether they themselves contribute or not, rather than how they use the reward system. Overall, their response to identifiable rewarders is muted, with low-confidence evidence of only mild, non-targeted reinforcement of cooperative norms."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a deliberately exploitative conditional contributor with a stark alternating pattern. They frequently give the minimum possible while others mostly contribute high amounts, capturing large private payoffs from others’ cooperation. Periodically, they switch to full contributions even when the group average has not collapsed, suggesting they are not a pure free-rider but rather an opportunistic mixed strategist.\n\nTheir contributions oscillate between minimum and maximum rather than gradually adjusting. This indicates low concern for smooth fairness norms and little effort to match others’ averages. The player shows no clear risk aversion about “wasting” contributions; they sometimes contribute fully even when others are already starting to reduce contributions and total returns are dropping. This pattern suggests that their main objective is not strict payoff maximization per round but a combination of: (a) exploiting cooperative phases, and (b) testing or maintaining their social standing with select players.\n\nTheir behavior is weakly conditional on others’ cooperation: they continue to free-ride even when the group remains highly cooperative, and they later contribute fully again when cooperation temporarily recovers. There is no sign that they try to sustain the group’s overall public-good level; rather, they use occasional high contributions as signals within a smaller reward-based exchange structure, not as a contribution norm enforcer.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThey are fully horizon-aware and do not exhibit standard “end-game defection” in a simple way. Instead of monotonically decreasing cooperation, they continue their alternating pattern of very low and very high contributions all the way through the final rounds.\n\nEven in the last few rounds, they sometimes contribute the minimum while most others contribute mid-to-high amounts, then abruptly switch back to maximum contributions despite no clear evidence that this benefits them materially in those specific rounds. This indicates they are not simply playing a final-round unraveling logic. They appear to continue using contributions and rewards as a coherent personal strategy to the end, rather than shifting into pure short-term exploitation at the horizon.\n\nOverall, end-game awareness is present (they know the round number), but their contribution behavior suggests a stable strategy that they maintain until the final round, rather than a horizon-driven change.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey are a moderately active but highly selective rewarder. They sometimes spend a nontrivial share of their payoff to grant rewards and sometimes refrain entirely, with no punishment option in the environment. Their reward behavior appears strategic rather than purely altruistic.\n\nPatterns indicate that they preferentially reward:\n- Players who contribute high or consistently cooperate.\n- Players who reward them.\nIn several phases, their own reward spending coincides with them also receiving substantial rewards, consistent with attempting to cultivate or reinforce mutual reward ties.\n\nThey do not seem to use rewards as a group-wide signal to sustain overall cooperation; when they spend, they target specific individuals rather than distributing small rewards broadly. At other times, they withhold rewards entirely while still taking advantage of others’ contributions by contributing the minimum. This suggests they view rewards as a tool for bilateral or small-cluster exchange, not as a general institution for group-level norm enforcement.\n\nThey appear willing to pay a real cost for reward, but only intermittently, suggesting they weigh costs against the likelihood of reciprocal benefits—either in direct rewards to themselves or in maintaining cooperative alliances. There is no evidence of spiteful or “anti-social” rewarding (e.g., rewarding low contributors); their observed reward use is consistent with reinforcing higher contributors and those who have previously favored them.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThey respond to being rewarded in ways consistent with reciprocal alliance-building. When they receive noticeable rewards, they are more likely, in nearby rounds, to both (a) contribute more and (b) spend on rewards themselves. This co-occurrence suggests gratitude signaling and an attempt to maintain beneficial ties rather than a purely self-centered free-ride strategy.\n\nHowever, this reciprocity is not universal or rigid. They do not mechanically reward every player who ever rewards them, nor do they permanently increase their contributions after being favored. Instead, they seem to use a flexible rule: reward and sometimes cooperate more toward those who appear to favor them or behave cooperatively, but retain freedom to revert to minimal contributions in later rounds even if alliances exist.\n\nThey are comfortable with asymmetric relationships: they can be rewarded substantially without immediately matching the rewarder’s level of generosity, and at other times they reward others when they themselves do not receive much in that specific round. This indicates that their reciprocity is probabilistic and strategic rather than strict tit-for-tat.\n\nOverall, they treat identifiable rewarders as valuable partners but not as individuals to whom they owe unconditional loyalty; reciprocity is present but moderated by their underlying opportunism.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey pay attention to others’ contributions, reward spending, and payoffs, but they do not appear to respond strongly to group-level outcomes. High group contributions and large total multipliers are often met with their own minimal contribution, indicating they are willing to exploit cooperative states instead of reinforcing them. They show little concern for the fact that some players repeatedly incur large reward costs and end rounds with low payoffs; they do not move to support or imitate these “over-generous” players.\n\nTheir main adjustments seem keyed to:\n- Who is consistently contributing high while not obviously exploiting rewards.\n- Who is rewarding them or their high-contributing peers.\n\nWhen others’ contributions fall and group payoffs decline, they often continue to free-ride rather than stepping up their own contributions to stabilize the group. At other times, they inject a burst of high contribution and some reward spending even when outcomes are already deteriorating, suggesting a focus on maintaining select bilateral relationships rather than rescuing the public good.\n\nThey display tolerance for inequality in payoffs: they routinely end rounds with higher payoffs than many cooperators when free-riding, and they do not compensate for this through extra reward giving. Conversely, when they themselves end with lower payoffs in contribution-heavy, reward-heavy rounds, they do not appear to shift toward consistent defection only; they continue to use a mixed approach. This points to a player who is outcome-aware but not equality-seeking, prioritizing selective reciprocity and personal advantage over collective efficiency or fairness."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a near-unconditional high contributor with one late defection. They almost always choose the cooperative, payoff-maximizing action even when personally attacked, showing strong preference for maintaining group efficiency over retaliating or free-riding. Their single zero contribution appears more like a brief, unexplained deviation than a full strategic shift; there is no accompanying message or pattern suggesting a deliberate end-game exploitation or revenge. Overall, they act as a “principled cooperator”: they keep contributing fully even when socially isolated and punished, suggesting that their cooperation is internally motivated rather than contingent on being treated nicely.\n\nThey show no clear conditionality on specific others’ contributions: they continue to contribute fully when others free-ride or when they themselves are targeted. They talk about “fair share” and “play fair,” indicating a fairness norm, but they do not enforce it through contribution changes. Risk tolerance appears moderate to high regarding social risk: they are willing to maintain high contributions even while expecting continued punishment and harassment, implying they prioritize norm-consistent behavior and personal values over short-term earnings security.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nTheir tone is generally calm, moralistic, and disapproving of cruelty rather than of low contributions. Early on, they align verbally with the group’s cooperative strategy, but they do not join in hostile or dehumanizing language. As the dominant coalition turns aggressively punitive and mocking toward specific players, they openly oppose the bullying, explicitly state they “don’t like bullies,” and frame their stance as about morals and disgust at picking on one person.\n\nThey attempt mild coordination around fairness and cooperation (talking about everyone giving their “fair share” and “playing fair”) but do not try to organize punishment campaigns. Their persuasion style is value-based rather than technical: they appeal to decency and maturity more than to game-theoretic arguments, and they mock others’ self-perceived superiority rather than their strategy. They respond when addressed and engage directly with the hostile majority, but without escalating to profanity or sustained insult; their barbs stay relatively restrained compared to others.\n\nThey show some initial confusion about the chat interface, mentioning they didn’t realize how to send properly, which may explain sparse or delayed responses early. Overall, they engage selectively: they speak when something matters to them (bullying, fairness) and otherwise stay relatively quiet, especially once it’s clear the group will not change its behavior. Their style is confrontational in principle but not in volume; they stand their ground but do not dominate the chat.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThere is no classic end-game unraveling in their contributions: they keep contributing fully through the final rounds, including the last one, despite awareness of remaining rounds and despite a hostile environment. Their lone zero contribution occurs in the back half of the game, but they immediately revert to full contributions, suggesting either a short-lived experiment, momentary frustration, or error rather than a systematic end-game strategy.\n\nThey do not respond to late-game calls for coordinated extreme punishment of a target, nor do they leverage the approaching end to shift toward self-interest or vengeance. Horizon awareness is present at group level (others discuss remaining time and end-round maneuvers), but there is no evidence that this player conditions behavior on it; their strategy remains stable and principle-driven rather than horizon-driven.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey are highly restrained in using punishment. For most of the game, they either do not punish or, when punishment is clearly directed by the group at supposed defectors, they do not visibly join in beyond a single small expenditure. They never publicly advocate for punishment in chat and never threaten others. When they finally do punish, the amount is modest relative to what others spend; target and motive are unknown from the transcript, but timing suggests it could be directed at a perceived unfair actor rather than as part of the group’s large-scale, spiteful punishment campaigns.\n\nTheir verbal stance is strongly anti-bullying, but not overtly anti-punishment as an institution. They criticize harassment and demeaning language more than the use of punishment to enforce contribution norms. They do not retaliate with punishment when they are insulted or threatened, even when others explicitly announce ongoing deductions against them. This indicates low propensity for retaliatory punishment and little taste for costly spite.\n\nOverall, they behave like a “reluctant, principled punisher”: willing to spend a small amount once, possibly to signal disapproval or align minimally with norm enforcement, but generally avoiding punishment when it is used as a tool of cruelty or domination rather than fairness or efficiency. Their primary response to norm violations (as they see them) is moral argument in chat, not monetary sanction."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a highly stable high contributor. After an initial mid-level contribution when they had not yet read the chat, they quickly align with the emerging “full contribution” norm and then almost always contribute the maximum. They explicitly affirm their own full-contribution behavior and use chat to signal compliance and encourage continuation of the cooperative standard. They appear to internalize an efficiency/fairness norm: everyone should give the maximum when the multiplier is high, and they treat deviations from this as norm violations. A single low-contribution incident later in the game looks like a likely mis-click or confusion rather than a strategic defection, as their chat message in that same moment claims a full contribution and they immediately return to maximum giving afterward without any apparent attempt to justify free-riding or to exploit the deviation. Overall, they exhibit conditional cooperation tied to group norms: once a strong convention of full giving is in place, they adhere to it consistently and seem to want others to do the same.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nTheir tone is friendly, cooperative, and lightly humorous. They participate actively in coordination, often confirming their own planned contribution and echoing others’ calls for full contributions. They are responsive to the chat: they change behavior after seeing early messages, encourage a previously low-contributing player when that player improves, and later question and discuss punishment events. They balance norm enforcement with politeness—apologizing when revealing their own punishment of a group member and framing criticism as “bad move” rather than personal attack. They occasionally provide clarifying information about the rules to others, indicating attentiveness and a mild teaching/clarifying orientation. They do not dominate conversation but reliably engage at key coordination and conflict points.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThey explicitly acknowledge the final round and continue to contribute the maximum, showing no end-game unraveling of cooperation. Instead of exploiting the last round to free-ride, they maintain the cooperative norm and even escalate norm enforcement through punishment when a peer behaves antagonistically. They appear to treat the horizon information as a signal to finalize “justice” against a disruptive player rather than a chance to personally profit. Their end-game behavior suggests that maintaining fairness and reciprocity norms matters more than short-run payoff maximization.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey are clearly willing to incur substantial personal cost to punish norm violators, both for under-contribution and for hostile or arbitrary punishment of cooperators. They target punishment selectively at one specific group member who repeatedly under-contributes and later punishes others without justification. Early punishments from this player fit a deterrence/discipline motive (aimed at increasing that player’s future contributions); they even pair punishment with positive social feedback when the target temporarily cooperates, signaling that punishment is behavior-contingent rather than purely spiteful. Later, when that same player continues to misbehave, they again invest in punishment, this time in a retaliatory/reciprocal justice mode, including joining others in “returning the favor” once the misbehaving player punishes a reliable cooperator. They do not appear to punish anyone else, even minor deviators, indicating a focused, proportional enforcement style rather than indiscriminate aggression. Overall, they fit a “strong reciprocator” pattern: prepared to pay to sanction defectors and anti-social punishers, with both deterrence and retribution elements.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nWhen they themselves are punished once despite having cooperated, they show surprise and seek an explanation, directly questioning why someone deducted from them. They do not retaliate blindly or lash out; instead, they engage in information-seeking and discussion. They do not subsequently target the specific punisher in any clear way, suggesting they are more upset about unfairness than about personal loss per se. Later, when another cooperator is punished without cause, they identify and publicly name the responsible party rather than responding emotionally, supporting collective condemnation rather than personal vendetta. Their stance toward punishers is thus conditional: they accept justified punishment as something that “only fair” players might do, but strongly disapprove of arbitrary or hostile punishment against cooperators and will support coordinated retaliation against such behavior when it is clearly identified.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey pay close attention to others’ contributions, payoffs, and punishment actions, and they comment on them in a norm-referencing way. When a low contributor improves, they immediately offer praise and thanks, reinforcing cooperative behavior socially. When that same individual later reverts to under-contributing or lies about constraints, they join others in questioning and criticizing the inconsistency. They express concern when a fellow full contributor is punished arbitrarily and help publicly identify the culprit, aligning with a fairness coalition. They also acknowledge and explain their own past punishment decisions to the group, signaling transparency and a desire to maintain group understanding of why outcomes look the way they do. Overall, they are sensitive to who is deserving vs. undeserving in terms of outcomes, and they use chat to align social judgments with the objective contribution and punishment records."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a strongly cooperative high contributor once group norms are clear, with one notable deviation. After an early moment of uncertainty about what they have actually done, they settle into consistently giving the maximum feasible amount when they understand that everyone else is coordinating on that level and that it is efficient. Their baseline appears to be: “match or exceed the emerging cooperative norm, especially when it clearly benefits the group.”\n\nThey do not appear to be experimenting with contribution levels for strategic gain. Apart from a single mid-game low contribution during a round of widespread deviation, they repeatedly choose the full endowment. That lone deviation coincides with a large breakdown in others’ contributions, suggesting they are not an unconditional altruist: when the group standard collapses and others free‑ride, they are willing to partially free‑ride as well. Even there, they remain a relatively high contributor relative to many others, implying they value fairness and collective payoff but will not sacrifice unconditionally in an obviously eroded norm environment.\n\nThey show no signs of risk-seeking experimentation or opportunistic last‑round defection. Even in the final round, when future repercussions no longer matter, they continue to contribute the maximum alongside the cooperative majority. This indicates either a stable adherence to cooperative norms, a preference-based motive for contributing, or a strong inclination to “finish well” with the group instead of exploiting the endgame.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nTheir tone is friendly, light, and cooperative, with mild use of informal language and emotive expressions. They frequently engage in brief, supportive comments rather than long arguments or moralizing. They respond to others’ actions with short, affective reactions (surprise, mild reproach, thanks) rather than technical reasoning.\n\nThey participate in coordination indirectly. Early on, they admit to doing something different from the emerging norm, but quickly align with it without defensiveness. Later they express confusion or mild disappointment when another player underperforms relative to the group. They thank others when they increase contributions, reinforcing the cooperative norm socially.\n\nThey do not attempt to lead or set rules. They neither outline strategies nor moral principles; instead, they follow and endorse the cooperative coalition, offering occasional social feedback that is consistent with the group’s pro-cooperation values. Their engagement level is moderate: they are present across the game, react when something salient happens (e.g., surprisingly low contributions or unexplained punishment), and acknowledge others’ efforts, but do not dominate the conversation.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThey show no visible end-game defection. Knowing it is the last round does not change their contribution behavior or trigger additional punishment. They maintain full cooperation up to and including the final round. They do not explicitly reflect on the end horizon; instead, they behave as if the social and fairness norms established earlier still apply.\n\nThey do, however, support retaliatory punishment by others against a norm violator in the final round via positive comments, indicating they see “closing accounts” as appropriate when someone has broken norms late in the game. Their own behavior remains prosocial and consistent rather than exploitative, suggesting that end-game awareness affects their approval of others’ retaliation more than their own cooperative choices.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey never spend any coins on punishment throughout the game. This is stable even when clear free-riding occurs and when almost everyone else is punishing a low contributor. Their restraint persists in situations where punishment is socially encouraged and relatively cheap and where deviators have been openly criticized, implying a strong reluctance to personally impose costs on others.\n\nAt the same time, they verbally disapprove of low contributions and later endorse others’ retaliatory punishment of a clear norm violator. This combination suggests they accept the legitimacy of sanctioning in principle, but prefer not to execute it themselves. Their stance appears closer to “sanction-supporting non-punisher” than to strict anti-punishment or unconditional forgiveness.\n\nTheir non-use of punishment is selective rather than driven by ignorance: they clearly understand the mechanism and discuss it indirectly when others use it. They do not appear to calculate or discuss cost-effectiveness; instead, their behavior hints at either conflict aversion, a desire to avoid being the direct source of harm, or a preference to rely on others to enforce norms.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nThey are never punished by anyone, so their direct behavioral response to being punished is unknown. There is no evidence of retaliation, compliance adjustments, or emotional reaction in response to personal sanctions, because none occur.\n\nTheir stance toward identifiable punishers, when they act against others, is tolerant to supportive. They do not criticize punishers, even when sanctioning is heavy, and occasionally align verbally with the idea that a particular target “deserves” or fairly receives deductions. They neither challenge nor question punishers’ motives, suggesting they are unlikely to retaliate against punishers purely for using the mechanism, at least when punishment aligns with widely shared fairness norms.\n\nOverall, their response profile to punishers is inferred as acceptance and indirect endorsement when punishment targets clear norm violators, with no observable inclination to counter‑punish or defend deviators.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey pay attention to others’ payoffs and punishment flows, referencing who has how many coins and reacting to who has been punished. They use outcome information to challenge questionable claims (e.g., when a low contributor says they have no coins, they implicitly treat that as suspicious) and to interpret whether someone “deserves” sanctions.\n\nThey respond warmly and approvingly when a previously low contributor raises their contribution, offering thanks and positive social reinforcement rather than calling back past misbehavior. When someone low‑contributes or free‑rides after prolonged cooperation, they express disappointment or mild reproach and later verbally support others’ retaliatory punishment, framing it as fair or expected. Their comments toward a heavy late punished player indicate that they see late defection as a “bad move” that spoils a good group history, and they are comfortable with that player facing substantial negative consequences.\n\nAcross the game, they appear sensitive to fairness and reciprocity: they notice deviations, support equal high contributions, and emotionally align with punishments and payoffs that restore balance, while personally avoiding direct sanctioning."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a generally high contributor who aims for full cooperation but is not unconditionally altruistic. They endorse the norm that everyone should give the maximum and explicitly promote this as the group’s standard. Their own behavior is mostly consistent with high cooperation, but they do strategically under-contribute in some middle rounds while still publicly pressing others to increase. This indicates conditional cooperation with a self-interested streak rather than pure unconditional giving. They appear to view “maximum contribution by all” as both fair and payoff-maximizing and expect others to adhere to that. They tolerate some noise or partial improvement from others (e.g., noticing when low contributors move up but still criticizing them for not reaching the maximum), but they clearly treat zero or persistently low contributions as norm violations. Risk-wise, they are willing to “trust” the group with full contributions multiple times even after free-riding appears, but they adjust in the middle of the game, suggesting moderate risk tolerance conditioned on observed behavior.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThey are active and engaged in chat, aligning quickly with early full-cooperation proposals and reinforcing group-oriented language (“team,” “everyone,” “we”). Their tone is generally cooperative but becomes critical toward specific low contributors. They call out low contributors by name and publicly pressure them to increase to the maximum, including bringing attention to others’ mid-level contributions and framing that as inadequate. They also explicitly restate the payoff logic (that giving the maximum leads to maximal returns for everyone), attempting to persuade others using both fairness and efficiency arguments. They coordinate around punishment norms as well, agreeing to strategies suggested by others and reporting their own compliance. They respond to others’ comments and build on them rather than talking past the group, showing responsiveness and a preference for explicit norm-setting and coordination. There is mild exasperation toward suspected “fake” or non-responsive players, but they maintain a relatively matter-of-fact tone rather than becoming abusive.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThey are clearly aware of the game horizon and adapt their stance as the end approaches. When another player proposes that contributions below the maximum in the final phase should be punished heavily, they promptly and explicitly endorse this. They continue to contribute the maximum themselves in the late game and signal that they are following through on the agreed punitive strategy. There is no visible decay in their own cooperation at the end; instead, they support escalating punishment threats as a way to lock in full contributions in the final rounds. This pattern suggests they treat the end-game not as an opportunity to defect but as a moment to enforce norms more strictly and secure collective payoff, even if that requires costly sanctioning.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey are clearly willing to punish and spend multiple units on punishment in several rounds. Their punishment appears norm-enforcing rather than retaliatory: there is no evidence they are themselves targeted and then respond; instead, they punish others who contribute little or nothing relative to the agreed-upon maximum. They explicitly link punishment to contribution behavior, agreeing that people who give less than the maximum should face deductions and affirming their own participation in that scheme. Their punishment is selective—aimed at clear under-contributors, particularly those who persist in contributing nothing or well below the group’s target after repeated discussion. They also support the idea of collective, coordinated punishment (“everyone deduct from them”), indicating a deterrence motive: they want punishment to signal that deviation from the norm will reliably be met with losses. There is no evidence they use punishment out of spite unrelated to contribution behavior; all observed comments about sanctioning connect it to cooperation levels.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey pay close attention to others’ outcomes and behavior. They notice when some players contribute nothing, and when others increase from zero to partial contributions, commenting that those changes are still insufficient compared to the agreed maximum. They acknowledge the presence of extreme punishment on low contributors and are part of the social conversation about those large deductions, though they do not explicitly moralize about punishment intensity beyond endorsing the basic principle. They infer that some persistently low or erratic players might be non-serious or non-human participants and adjust their expectations accordingly, but they still advocate continued pressure and punishment toward them. When discussing who “owes” the group or who “needs to up” their contribution, they are clearly tracking both past and present behavior, not just the most recent round, and they use that information to support calls for future punishment or continued demands for full contribution. Overall, they appear outcome-sensitive and norm-oriented, using others’ payoffs and contributions as cues for who deserves social pressure and sanction."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a strict, unconditional full cooperator within the horizon provided. They always contribute the entire endowment and never experiment with lower amounts, despite clear evidence that several others repeatedly free-ride. Their cooperation is therefore not conditional on observed group behavior in this game; they continue to maximize the group’s material efficiency even when others do not. This suggests a strong internal norm that “the right thing” is to give the maximum, combined with relatively low concern for own short-run payoff optimization. They exhibit a fairness norm defined as “everyone should contribute the maximum,” but they do not adjust their own contribution downward when that fairness norm is violated. Risk tolerance regarding exploitation is high: they accept being systematically more generous than many others. There is no observable volatility in contribution; their strategy is stable and rigid rather than adaptive in contribution levels.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThey communicate as an assertive, coordination-focused team player. From the outset, they propose the simple focal rule that everyone contributes the maximum and frame it as a team effort that benefits all. They repeat this norm multiple times, even after it is clear that several players are not following it, indicating persistence and a desire to keep the group anchored on the cooperative strategy. Their tone is direct but not hostile; they use inclusive language (“everyone,” “team”) and avoid insults, although they do label some low contributors as “trolling” and question whether they are real/active, reflecting frustration and a tendency to explain defection as non-serious or non-human behavior. They respond actively to others’ chat, acknowledge others’ observations, and build on emerging group norms (for example, explicitly aligning with the idea that the group should punish undercontributors in later rounds). They attempt to lead by articulating clear rules (contribute maximum; punish non-compliers at the end), and they try to make consequences explicit to shape others’ expectations (“anyone less than max will lose their pot”). Overall, they are engaged, directive, and norm-enforcing rather than withdrawn or purely self-focused.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThey are clearly horizon-aware and bring the end of the game into their normative enforcement strategy. While their own contributions remain maximally cooperative through the final round (no decay in cooperation), they explicitly propose tying harsh punishment to the last round: anyone who does not contribute the maximum in the final stage should be collectively punished. This indicates they think strategically about how the finite horizon might invite last-round defection and aim to preempt it with a credible threat of strong sanctions. They do not themselves increase punishment spending in the last round and, in fact, use less punishment than in a prior round, suggesting that their main adjustment to the end-game is rhetorical and coordinative (threats and norm statements) rather than a change in their own costly actions. Their cooperation thus does not unravel as the game ends; instead, they try to sustain or even strengthen cooperation norms with end-game-focused punishment planning.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey are willing but selective punishers, with a clear trigger: contributing far below the agreed maximum, especially after repeated discussion and clarification. For several rounds they choose not to spend on punishment at all, even when free-riding is present. This suggests either an initial hope that communication alone will align behavior or a reluctance to incur punishment costs until noncompliance becomes persistent and salient. When they finally deploy punishment, they spend a nontrivial amount in a single round, consistent with a norm-enforcement motive rather than mild signaling. The targets, inferred from their chat, are extreme or repeated undercontributors, not minor deviators, which indicates they distinguish between small shortfalls and blatant free-riding. Their language about punishment (“everyone should deduct from them,” “they will lose their pot”) frames sanctions as a collective deterrent tool, not as personal retaliation for being personally harmed. They coordinate with others around punishment rules and timing, pointing to a preference for shared, predictable enforcement rather than idiosyncratic or emotional punishment. After this heavy sanctioning incident, they personally refrain from further costly punishment, which could indicate satisfaction that the message has been sent, a desire to avoid overspending, or a belief that group-level punishment is already sufficient. There is no clear evidence of spiteful or retaliatory targeting beyond norm violations; motives appear primarily deterrent and pro-social in intent.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey pay close attention to others’ contributions and, at least to some extent, to punishment outcomes. They repeatedly call out specific low contributors by role name and track when someone increases or decreases their contribution relative to the expected maximum. Their comments focus mainly on behavior (who is giving zero or less than the maximum, who has “gone back” to lower contributions) rather than on others’ exact payoffs, but they do notice large punishment totals and express surprise at extreme deductions. When they see heavy sanctions being applied, they remark on how large the deductions are, signaling awareness of how severe group punishment can be when many players coordinate. They interpret persistent undercontributors as possibly inactive or non-serious and discuss them with others in that frame, suggesting they are mentally categorizing types of players (cooperators, norm violators, maybe bots/inactive players). Their emotional tone around others’ outcomes is mostly matter-of-fact and strategic: they note who should be punished and encourage group response, rather than expressing personal resentment or gloating over specific losses. Overall, they monitor the social and payoff environment to reinforce their cooperation-and-punishment norm, but they do not use detailed payoff accounting to fine-tune their own contributions or punishments."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a near-maximum unconditional cooperator with one early deviation. They quickly commit in chat to “100%” contributions going forward, and then actually contributes the maximum endowment essentially every round, including when others defect or when they themselves suffer large payoff losses from punishment spending. The only non-max contribution appears early and is immediately framed as a mistake, followed by explicit promises to contribute fully. Their cooperation is not obviously conditional on others’ behavior: they keep putting in the full amount even when group contributions drop sharply or when specific individuals free-ride. They seem to treat full contribution as a moral or normative baseline (“follow society rules”) rather than a strategic lever, and they show no sign of lowering contributions to retaliate or to protect their own earnings. Risk tolerance in contributions is high; they are willing to lose money relative to more selfish strategies and do not adjust that stance when they learn the actual money conversion rate. They appear fairness-driven at the level of norms (everyone should give the max), but they enforce norms primarily via punishment rather than adjusting their own giving.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThey are highly chatty, humorous, and socially central. They frequently initiate topics, coin jokes, and use playful metaphors (e.g., “police,” “justice,” references to movies and bots, joking about inspect-element “cheats”). They engage in coalition-building, repeatedly trying to coordinate group norms and group punishment, including explicit calls for everyone to “hit” a target together. They are responsive to others’ comments, acknowledge others’ points, and riff on shared themes (e.g., whether the bird is a bot, pay fairness, the length of the game). Their tone mixes light sarcasm and self-deprecation with serious norm-enforcement messages. They openly reveal their own coin total when others discuss payoffs, which suggests comfort with transparency and with turning private information into a public coordination signal. They also probe and tease quieter players (e.g., questioning silence as “sus”), trying to draw them into the social fabric. Overall, they are an active “narrator-instigator” type: they keep the chat lively while steering it toward common targets and shared understandings about the game and its norms.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey are an extremely willing and often heavy punisher, to the point of repeatedly sacrificing large portions of their own payoff. Early, they immediately punish the prominent low contributor and later escalate to multi-unit, high-cost punishments against the same “angry bird” (Parrot), even when others caution that it may be a bot and that punishing wastes coins. Their language frames punishment as “justice,” “police duty,” and “making an example,” indicating a strong moralistic and norm-enforcing motivation rather than pure payoff maximization. They openly acknowledge that this is financially irrational (“taking straight loss,” “emptying my bank on justice,” “perma police”) yet keep doing it, suggesting intrinsic satisfaction from norm reinforcement and from coordinated collective punishment. They actively recruit others to punish, encouraging multi-player “dogpiles” to bankrupt or discipline targets and treating that as a joint project. Their punishments are mostly directed at:\n- Chronic under-contributors / norm violators (Parrot, low contributors, sudden defection).\n- Occasional “suspicious” cooperators (e.g., Monkey, Rabbit once) when they appear to be linked to the bird’s unusual reward pattern or odd behavior; here they signal “warning shots” rather than immediate maximal sanctions.\nThey rarely, if ever, punish high cooperators for ordinary variation; the targeting seems anchored in perceived rule-breaking, free-riding, or “suspicious” patterns. They also sometimes threaten to “max” punish if personally targeted, implying a readiness for strong retaliation if attacked. Overall, punishment is primarily deterrent and expressive of group norms, with some paranoia-driven components when trying to infer hidden relationships.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey exhibit very low baseline willingness to use the reward mechanism, especially compared to punishment. For most of the game they do not reward anyone despite clearly valuing high cooperators and despite receiving rewards themselves. Near the end, they do use reward once in a non-trivial way, spending enough to give a meaningful bonus to a peer who has been aligned and cooperative (Moose). This delayed, targeted reward appears more like a gesture of appreciation or alliance-strengthening than a systematic strategy: they choose a socially connected, cooperative peer who has been active in coordination and anti-bird efforts. They also verbally request to be “topped up” by others when they burn many coins on punishment, signaling that they conceptually separate “justice spending” from reward reciprocity. In practice, they treat reward as secondary and symbolic—used sparingly, to acknowledge or reciprocate support, rather than as a main tool for shaping behavior.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey pay close attention to who earned what, who was punished, and who was rewarded, and they frequently comment on these outcomes in chat. Large gains by the problematic bird strongly trigger them; they interpret high payoffs combined with low contributions or odd reward patterns as evidence of free-riding, trolling, or bot-like behavior, and respond by organizing collective punishment. They track who is getting rewards from the bird and use that as a basis for social suspicion (e.g., interrogating Monkey and Cow about being “in on it”), though they will back off somewhat once those players openly explain themselves. They are sensitive to group-level fairness: they repeatedly highlight when a deviant makes “the most” while not following rules, and they express satisfaction when coordinated punishment drags that player back down. They also show empathetic but joking reactions when innocent cooperators get hit (e.g., Frog, Cow), encouraging them to “clap back” or get revenge, and framing that as justified reciprocity. When others caution that punishing the bird is wasteful given the bonus conversion, they acknowledge the logic but still often choose to punish, articulating that it “costs a penny to feel better,” indicating they weight fairness and expressive satisfaction over strict monetary efficiency. They adapt somewhat to information (learning the conversion rate, realizing the bird may be part of the design, noticing the time cost of the study), but their core behavioral type—max cooperator, norm-focused, punishment-ready—remains stable."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a stable, unconditional full cooperator. They always contribute the entire endowment in every observed round, including when others reduce their contributions sharply, when punishment becomes chaotic, and when they themselves are punished once. Their own behavior does not appear to condition on group contribution levels, on being treated unfairly, or on the length/return of the game. They implicitly adopt a strong “do the socially right thing regardless” norm, even when the marginal return is low and when others discuss that the monetary payoff may not justify effort. Risk tolerance for exploitation is high: they keep contributing fully amid clear, repeated evidence that some others are deviating or free-riding. There is no sign of end-game defection or strategic withholding; they maintain the same pattern until the final round shown.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThey communicate sparsely but clearly, with a straightforward and cooperative tone. Early on they agree with the group’s call for maximum contributions and later make a rare, norm-affirming statement emphasizing that people “have to give” when someone else complains about being hit by the punishing bird. They occasionally inject light criticism (e.g., expressing disapproval of a low contributor) but without hostility. They also show some procedural awareness and mild skepticism about the experiment’s design and compensation, remarking on how pre-submitting completion on the recruitment platform affects minimum pay. They raise a technical/process issue about chat messages disappearing and explicitly ask whether others notice it, showing attention to interface and fairness of the information environment. Overall, they are engaged enough to track dynamics and meta-issues, but they do not try to lead, rally factions, or steer group norms through speech; they mostly comment and observe rather than orchestrate.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey are generally reluctant to use punishment, but not absolutist. Their punishment is rare, targeted, and clearly norm-driven rather than emotional or spiteful. They punish only twice: once early, directed at a very low contributor relative to the emerging “max or near-max” norm; and much later, directed at two specific players who contribute sharply below the group’s level after long periods of mutual cooperation. This pattern suggests they view punishment as a tool for enforcing a high-contribution norm when deviations are salient and potentially destabilizing. They do not join in the large, repeated anti-bird punishment cascades, nor in later mobbing of suspected “researcher/bot” or “sus” players, even when others explicitly coordinate mass punishments. They also never retaliate against those who punish them; when they receive an unjustified deduction, they neither punish back nor reduce their contributions. In summary, they are a selective, norm-enforcing punisher with a high threshold: willing to spend on punishment when a deviation is clear and personally judged as unfair, but unwilling to participate in symbolic, costly “justice” campaigns or to punish for entertainment or revenge.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey never use rewards at any point, despite frequent group discussions about topping up “police” players and about various players receiving rewards from the bird. There is no evidence that they even experiment with rewarding once. Given that they observe the same information as others, this suggests either (a) they do not see rewarding as necessary or efficient relative to simply sustaining their own high contribution, or (b) they implicitly prioritize preserving coins for their own payoff over positive reinforcement, even while tolerating some punishment costs in very specific cases. Compared to their selective willingness to punish, their total absence of rewarding indicates an asymmetry: they are prepared to sanction norm-breakers but not to pay to recognize or encourage norm-compliers, at least under this cost/benefit structure.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey monitor others’ payoffs and the mechanism outcomes enough to notice anomalies and comment on them. They remark when a known low contributor is still doing well, express disapproval of that behavior, and later call out under-contributors as “sus” or problematic. They also notice the bird/parrot’s unusual payoff growth and question how it is gaining so much, indicating attention to aggregate outcomes and possible manipulation. When the group’s punishment campaigns against the bird become intense and prolonged, they consistently refrain from joining, even while acknowledging the situation in chat, implying that their internal tradeoff between fairness and personal payoff is more conservative than that of the self-styled “justice” players. Their own behavior remains stable and cooperative regardless of whether others are being heavily punished, massively rewarded, or partly exploited. In short, they are observant and analytically engaged with others’ outcomes, but they do not let those observations destabilize their core strategy of full contribution plus highly selective punishment."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a strict, stable full cooperator. They always contribute the maximum possible amount to the public good, from the very start and without experimenting or hedging. Their cooperation is not conditional on others’ behavior: they keep contributing fully even when others under-contribute, when there is confusion, when there is clear evidence of a disruptive “bot-like” player, and when they themselves are actively spending on punishment or reward. They consistently endorse the “max for everyone” social norm in chat and never advocate lowering contributions. Risk tolerance appears relatively high: they do not appear to protect themselves by reducing contributions in response to uncertainty, free-riding, or ending-game fatigue. There is no sign of opportunistic behavior; they behave like a principled cooperator with a fairness norm that “everyone should give the max” and that they themselves should do so regardless.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThey are moderately chatty and clearly engaged with the group, but not the dominant voice. Tone is warm, humorous, and prosocial. They align themselves with the cooperative majority, support emerging norms, and occasionally inject light jokes about the game’s length and “living here now,” which shows comfort and social ease rather than detachment or hostility.\n\nThey respond to others’ points (e.g., acknowledging correction about player count, agreeing that some behavior “makes sense,” echoing “sus” judgments about potentially problematic avatars) rather than driving their own agenda. They rarely initiate new strategic norms, but they reinforce existing ones and lend social support to those enforcing cooperation.\n\nThey participate in the shared narrative about the “angry bird/parrot” and researchers, appear to enjoy the collective theorizing, and use that narrative as a frame for behavior (“kill the bird,” “very sus”). They are not confrontational; even when advocating retaliation against the disruptive avatar, their style remains playful and collective (“have a little boost; kill the bird”) rather than aggressive or moralizing.\n\nOverall, they show a cooperative, affiliative, and group-oriented communication style: they help maintain cohesion, validate others, and keep the mood light, while staying aligned with cooperative norms.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey are willing to punish, but only selectively and under strong social consensus. For most of the game they refrain from using punishment at all despite repeated calls from others to “ding” under-contributors and the disruptive bird. This indicates an underlying reluctance to spend on punishment or a preference to let others take that role when it is already being filled.\n\nThey eventually do punish, and their target choice is tightly norm-based: they punish the clearly non-compliant “angry bird/parrot,” and much later again target the same avatar in a mixed punishment/reward move. They do not punish borderline contributors, slight deviations, or human cooperators who make small mistakes. There is no evidence of spite, personal vendetta, or punishment directed at group members who question the experiment or pay rates.\n\nTheir punishment seems motivated by collective justice and norm enforcement rather than personal gain: they punish when the bird is viewed as an unfair, possibly non-human exploiter, and they frame it in chat as something that “has to change” and that “they’ll feel.” They join the coordinated “hit the bird” moments but do not escalate beyond what others are doing, and they do not continue punishing once the bird is heavily sanctioned and group attention drifts.\n\nDeterrence and moral signaling appear more important than maximizing their own payoff. However, they do not turn into a “perma police”; they remain a mostly cooperative, low-punishment type who intervenes episodically when the group norm and their own sense of fairness are strongly violated.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey are distinctly more inclined to use reward than punishment, especially early on. They reward only a few times, which makes those choices informative. Recipients of their rewards are consistently high contributors and/or victims/allies in the bird drama: players who cooperate fully and either suffer from unjust deductions or invest heavily in group justice. They use reward to top up allies and to reinforce prosocial behavior.\n\nTheir reward behavior looks intentional rather than random: they spread small, costly rewards to specific cooperators, suggesting they pay attention to who has behaved “well” or been treated unfairly, and they are willing to sacrifice their own earnings to support those players. They also reward the talkative enforcer once, signaling gratitude and alliance.\n\nThey never reward low contributors or the bird. They are not using reward to manipulate future play (no evidence of “reward to make defectors cooperate”); instead, they behave like a conditional altruist who uses reward to recognize and bolster existing cooperators and justice enforcers. They are also comfortable combining reward and punishment in a single round, showing they think in terms of a full toolkit of social incentives rather than a single preferred mechanism.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey pay close attention to others’ outcomes and integrate this into their social and strategic views. They notice when someone has exited, when someone is doing unusually well, and when payoffs jump due to reward or punishment activity. They explicitly comment on anomalies (e.g., someone earning “+42” or “doing so well”) and on fairness (“that’s got to change” when the bird’s payoff is disproportionate).\n\nWhen others are heavily punished (e.g., frog, cow), they sympathize and respond constructively rather than ignoring it. They compliment or help those players via reward or by encouraging them to retaliate and giving them “a little boost.” This shows sensitivity to others’ disadvantage and a willingness to redistribute from themselves to restore perceived fairness.\n\nThey accept being rewarded without gloating; when thanked by another player, they respond briefly but positively, indicating they interpret reward as a social bond rather than a license to free-ride. They do not appear envious of other cooperators doing marginally better; they share their own cumulative coins transparently and engage lightly in that comparison without changing behavior.\n\nThey also update beliefs based on observed outcomes: they join the group’s emerging belief that the bird is likely a bot or researcher, react to how many coins the bird accumulates, and adjust from passivity to active punishment once the extent of the bird’s advantage is salient and the group shifts to “destroy the bird” coordination. However, these belief updates do not make them reduce their public contributions; they remain steadfastly cooperative even when perceiving the game as somewhat unfair or exploitative.\n\nIn sum, this player is a “Principled Group Altruist with Selective Justice”: they always cooperate fully, are socially engaged and supportive, reward good partners and victims, and reserve punishment for clear, consensus-defined violators such as a suspected bot/free-rider. They prioritize fairness and group cohesion over narrow self-interest, and they adapt their use of punishment and reward in response to others’ outcomes while keeping their own contribution level constant."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a high, mostly unconditional cooperator with occasional small defections that seem driven by doubt or fatigue rather than a systematic exploitative strategy.\n\nThey contribute the full endowment in the vast majority of rounds, including at the very start when the group norm of full contribution is still only being proposed, which indicates a willingness to “go first” on cooperation and accept personal risk. When they undercontribute, they do so only mildly (low single digits) and very rarely, and they do not follow through with a sustained reduction even after being punished once for contributing very little. This pattern suggests they value maintaining the cooperative norm and the resulting group earnings more than they value short‑term individual gains from free‑riding.\n\nTheir initial explanation that they “weren’t sure if people were bluffing” shows conditionality based on expectations of others’ behavior: they are willing to be fully cooperative, but they care whether the group is truly aligned. Once they see stable high contributions from others, they settle into reliably maxing out, without trying to track or fine‑tune their own contribution against others’ small deviations.\n\nThey show no evidence of fine‑grained payoff optimization (they do not start shaving their contribution by 1–2 units once cooperation is stable), which, combined with their tolerance of minor norm violations by others, points to a “prosocial but not hyper‑calculating” type. They also continue full cooperation even as the chat becomes increasingly focused on low pay and fatigue, suggesting they either discount the opportunity cost of time or prioritize finishing cleanly with the group.\n\nOverall, this is best described as a “loyal cooperator”: they enter willing to cooperate, briefly test the sincerity of others, and then stay aligned with the cooperative norm almost regardless of noise, trolling, or frustration.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThey communicate sparingly but meaningfully, with a cooperative, apologetic, and information‑seeking tone. Compared to very chatty players, they rarely initiate topics; when they do speak, it is directly related to coordination or understanding anomalies.\n\nEarly on, they openly admit past undercontribution and apologize, framing it explicitly as uncertainty rather than selfishness. This disclosure indicates concern for their reputation and a desire to repair trust. They quickly endorse the “all max, no deductions” coordination proposal once it is reiterated, showing alignment with group norms and willingness to publicly commit.\n\nLater, when the group suspects a “bot” or manipulated account, they ask a targeted question about whether anyone has rewarded that player, indicating they track payoff anomalies and seek clarification rather than jumping immediately to conspiracy or moral outrage. This displays curiosity and analytic engagement rather than emotional escalation.\n\nThey do not join in the more theatrical, punitive rhetoric (“kill X,” “destroy the bird”) nor in meta‑complaints about pay or platform ethics. Relative to the dominant chat tone, they are calm, low‑key, and non‑provocative, aligning themselves with the cooperative majority without taking on a leadership or inciter role. They respond when directly implicated (explaining their earlier behavior) and when they perceive informational gaps (asking about rewards), but otherwise default to quiet cooperation.\n\nIn social style, they come across as conciliatory, reputation‑sensitive, and group‑oriented, but not attention‑seeking.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey never use the punishment mechanism despite many opportunities, including clear norm violations (very low contributions) and strong group pressure to “deal justice.” This consistent non‑use, across both early uncertainty and later coordinated punishment campaigns, suggests a stable aversion to costly punishment.\n\nGiven the punishment technology is very powerful relative to its cost, their abstention is unlikely to be due to misunderstanding the mechanism. Instead, it indicates either a preference to avoid harming others, skepticism about the value of punishment for group outcomes, or a personal cost‑benefit calculus that deems even cheap punishment not worth the reduction in their own payoff.\n\nThey also refrain from “joining the crowd” in punitive episodes where virtually everyone else is targeting a single deviant, which implies they are not particularly swayed by social pressure to punish. There is no sign of reactive retaliation: even after they themselves are punished for low contribution, they do not punish back and instead simply restore high contributions and apologize in chat. This is more consistent with a forgiving or non‑vengeful type than with a conditional cooperator who uses punishment as enforcement.\n\nFunctionally, they behave as a “principled non‑punisher”: they want cooperation, but they prefer to sustain it through their own consistent contribution and communication rather than by inflicting costs on others.\n\n<REWARD>\nFor most of the game, they do not use the reward mechanism at all, even when others are actively rewarded for high contributions or for punishing perceived deviants. This again points to a conservative approach to spending on social tools: they prioritize keeping their own earnings rather than using them to shape others’ incentives.\n\nHowever, there is one clear deviation: in a later round they do reward at least one other player (evident from others noting “bunny and cow rewarded”). The context is one in which some players have been randomly targeted or “wronged” by the suspected bot‐like player, and others discuss boosting them. Their lone use of rewards coincides with that narrative, suggesting that when they do reward, it is not for strict norm enforcement but for compensating perceived unfair harm or for solidarity with victims.\n\nEven in that case, they use reward very sparingly; they do not begin a pattern of regular rewarding afterward. This makes them a “reluctant rewarder”: default is to keep coins, with rare, low‑intensity deviations when motivated by fairness or empathy.\n\nThey do not appear to use reward instrumentally to sustain high contributions (they never systematically reward top contributors), nor to curry favor; the isolated reward use is more consistent with moral expression than with strategic incentive design.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey pay attention to others’ outcomes and use them to update beliefs and ask questions, but they do not let others’ payoffs drive their own aggression or opportunism.\n\nWhen they undercontribute early and see that the group did indeed largely match the proposed full‑contribution norm, they quickly issue an apology and then align their behavior with the majority, indicating that observing others’ high contributions and payoffs pushes them toward more, not less, cooperation.\n\nThey notice the anomalously high earnings and complex punishment/reward activity of the “angry bird/parrot” player and actively query the group about whether anyone has been rewarding that player. This shows that they are monitoring others’ round payoffs and punishment/reward summaries, and they use this information diagnostically to understand the environment. They accept the emerging group framing (that this player may be a bot or special role) but do not escalate it into personal vendetta through their own punishment.\n\nWhen they themselves are punished in a round where they contributed almost nothing, they do not protest in chat. Instead, their future contributions return to the maximum level and stay there, suggesting they interpret negative outcomes as a signal about expected norms rather than as an affront that requires retaliation. This is consistent with a player who internalizes feedback rather than trying to counter‑punish.\n\nThey also show no sign of free‑riding based on others’ enforcement efforts. Even when others expend large amounts on punishment, dragging their own payoffs down, this player continues to contribute highly and avoids exploiting the protection arising from others’ policing.\n\nOverall, they are attentive and reflective about others’ payoffs and sanctioning but respond mainly by adjusting their own cooperation and seeking information, not by changing their willingness to harm, reward, or exploit others."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a persistent unconditional high contributor. They always contribute the full endowment, even when others deviate sharply or when they explicitly acknowledge that pay is low relative to time. Their own stated stance is that they will contribute the maximum regardless of others, and their behavior matches that. They do not condition contributions on low effort, exploitation by the “angry bird”, or uncertainty about remaining rounds. Risk tolerance is high: they keep sacrificing private payoff to maintain group efficiency even when the marginal per capita return is low and others intermittently free-ride. They show a strong norm of “everyone should give the max,” but their own contribution behavior does not fluctuate when that norm is violated; they punish instead of reducing their own contributions.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThey are highly engaged, humorous, and socially oriented. From the start, they frame cooperation as obvious and desirable, use light jokes and memes, and riff on others’ comments. They reference studies, bots, researchers, and movie/Internet culture, treating the game as both a social experiment and a social space. They actively coordinate norms (max contributions, targeting the deviant bird, later suspicion of owl) but with playful rather than domineering tone. They respond quickly to others, pick up others’ ideas (e.g., “rotate police,” democracy vs bot), and help maintain group cohesion when frustration rises about pay or duration. They openly share some private info (their coin total) when others do. They engage in mild meta-commentary about fairness of compensation but do not use that as a reason to defect. Overall they communicate as a sociable, group-identity-focused player who likes collective narratives (“new society,” “researcher troll,” “democracy is non‑negotiable”) and uses chat to keep morale and coordination high.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey are very willing to punish, including at substantial personal cost. Their early punishment targets the lowest contributor, consistent with enforcing a contribution norm. Once the “angry bird” (Parrot) emerges as a repeated low contributor and exploiter, they repeatedly punish it, including several high-intensity bursts that meaningfully reduce their own payoff. They explicitly express a motive of “justice,” talk about needing to “destroy” the deviant, and join coalition punishments when others propose coordinated hits. Deterrence and norm enforcement appear primary: they do not punish random players or high contributors, and they join group calls to sanction those who are seen as bots, trolls, or norm violators. However, their punishment of Owl at the very end is more suspicion- and frustration-driven than strictly payoff-based; Owl’s earlier behavior is mixed, and the trigger seems to be Owl suddenly doing very well combined with low contributions in a late round and other players calling them “sus.” That suggests they also punish to restore perceived social fairness, even with incomplete information.\n\nThey do not appear to use punishment as retaliation for being punished themselves (they are almost never targeted) nor as strategic intimidation for future gains; instead they accept that punishing costs them “real money” and continue anyway, suggesting strong non-monetary preferences for norm enforcement and group justice. They occasionally talk about “democracy” and “justice” in the same breath, and they coordinate with others before punishing, but they are also willing to act independently when they feel a violator must be sanctioned.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey reward infrequently but in a targeted, relational way. When they do reward, they focus on Gorilla, who is the most visibly “perma police” enforcer against the deviant bird. They explicitly say they top up Gorilla and later reward them again, essentially subsidizing Gorilla’s costly enforcement. This suggests they use rewards as gratitude and as strategic reinforcement of prosocial punishment rather than for pure equality or random generosity. They do not reward high contributors in general or the group at large; rewards cluster on a single ally. They also seem attentive to rewards they receive from others, mentioning when they notice being rewarded by the bird and interpreting it as information about the bird’s identity or strategy rather than just a payoff bump. Overall they are much more inclined to spend on punishment than on reward; reward is reserved for acknowledging and supporting those they see as aligned enforcers.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey closely monitor others’ contributions, payoffs, and reward/punishment histories and actively interpret them. They quickly label low contributors or odd patterns as “sus,” “researcher,” or “bot” and suggest or join group actions against them. They notice when someone gets unusually high payoffs, when a deviant avoids punishment, who is being rewarded, and how many coins the bird spends on reward vs punishment. That information shapes their beliefs: they oscillate between thinking the bird is a non-human bot, a researcher, or a “genius criminal,” and they occasionally question whether punishing the bird is economically wise. Despite grasping the low monetary return, they continue to punish, prioritizing symbolic fairness and group narrative over strict earnings.\n\nThey react positively to others’ high contributions and cooperative talk, reinforcing the “we’re all in this together” frame, and they do not retaliate against peers who briefly under-contribute if those peers correct themselves and align with group norms. They also respond to others’ exhaustion and concerns about underpayment with jokes and shared frustration, but without reducing their own contributions. Toward the end, as the game drags on, they become more impatient and slightly darker in humor (e.g., “kill owl”), but still keep cooperating and directing punishment toward those perceived as exploiting or gaming the system. Overall, they are a high-cooperation, high-enforcement, socially attuned “justice enforcer with a sense of humor,” who tracks outcomes carefully and uses both punishment and selective reward to shape group norms, even when that behavior is privately costly."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThe player is a strict, stable free-rider. They consistently contribute nothing in every decision, regardless of others’ behavior, the average contribution level, or changes in group size. Their strategy does not exhibit exploration or adjustment; it is a fixed rule rather than a reactive or conditional approach.\n\nThey appear to reason in payoff-maximizing terms given the game’s structure: the marginal per-capita return is below 1, so keeping the full endowment strictly dominates contributing from an individual-profit perspective. Their behavior aligns with a purely self-interested best response in a linear PGG without punishment or reputation consequences.\n\nThey do not follow reciprocity or fairness norms. They continue to free-ride even when others are clearly contributing very high amounts and could plausibly expect mutual cooperation. The player shows no tendency to “reward” cooperative episodes with partial giving, nor to “sanction” low-contribution periods with any change in their own behavior; they simply ignore these social signals.\n\nRisk tolerance in contribution space is effectively irrelevant for them because they never stake any coins on the public fund. This indicates either high aversion to downside risk for oneself, complete disregard for group payoffs, or both. Given that they repeatedly enjoy high returns generated by others without ever sharing costs, they are comfortable benefiting from positive externalities with no evident guilt or corrective impulse (though internal motivations are unknown).\n\nThe contribution pattern is highly stable and non-volatile: there are no switches, partial contributions, or reactive spikes. This stability suggests a pre-committed strategy (“always keep everything”) rather than trial-and-error learning. Conditional cooperation, inequality aversion, or norms of proportionality are not expressed in their actions.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThe player shows no end-game shift because their baseline behavior is already full defection. They begin with zero contributions and maintain this level through the final decision. As a result, there is no visible decay or escalation in cooperation tied to the known time horizon; their play is horizon-invariant.\n\nAwareness of the number of remaining rounds does not alter their strategy in any detectable way. Since they never cooperate at any point, they have no cooperative posture to unwind as the end approaches, nor do they attempt any last-round exploitation spike (they are already exploiting the group from the outset).\n\nFrom an inferential standpoint, this is consistent with a belief that contributing is never privately optimal, regardless of stage in the game, and that others’ tendencies to contribute can be treated as an exogenous resource to harvest rather than a pattern to cultivate or preserve. Whether they consciously model others as potentially reacting to their free-riding is unknown, but their unchanging strategy implies low concern for sustaining future cooperation.\n\nIn new PGG environments with similar incentives and no effective sanctions or reputational mechanisms, this player type is expected to defect from the start and stay that way, independent of remaining rounds or observed shifts in group behavior."

They always withhold their entire endowment and never deviate, indicating a stable, non-conditional strategy rather than experimentation or noise. They behave as if they have fully internalized that their individual marginal return from contributing is lower than keeping their endowment, and they act to maximize own payoff regardless of group benefit.\n\nThey show no apparent reciprocity: their contributions do not increase when others contribute more, nor do they decrease when others contribute less. This suggests they either do not hold a fairness norm of “matching” others, or they deliberately override it in favor of self-interest. They appear comfortable earning systematically higher payoffs than many cooperators, implying low concern for inequality when it benefits them.\n\nTheir risk tolerance in this context is oriented toward guaranteed personal earnings. They do not “invest” in the public good even when it is clearly producing high returns for the group, indicating a preference for the sure private payoff over any uncertain indirect benefit (such as future norm shifts or reciprocal cooperation) that might arise from contributing. There is no evidence of learning toward cooperation; instead, they exhibit a stable, payoff-maximizing, defecting profile throughout.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThe player regularly observes that many others contribute while they do not, yet they persist in free-riding. This implies that seeing others obtain lower payoffs as a consequence of contributing does not induce them to adjust toward more cooperative behavior. They appear indifferent to the fact that cooperators often earn less than they do, and they do not attempt to “correct” this through voluntary contributions.\n\nBecause no punishment or reward options exist, there is no direct behavioral evidence of how they would spend resources to alter others’ payoffs. However, from their unwavering non-contribution despite clear group provision, it is reasonable (though low confidence) to infer that they are unlikely to incur personal costs to help norm-enforce cooperation or to compensate others. They seem to accept and exploit a setting where others’ contributions raise the group return and their own payoff without imposing any obligation to reciprocate.\n\nOverall, they respond to others’ outcomes primarily by maintaining a strategy that preserves their relative advantage: they continue to free-ride even when this means others repeatedly bear the cost of generating the public good. Any emotional or moral reactions remain unknown, but behaviorally they act as a payoff-focused self-interested defector who does not adjust in response to observed inequality or collective losses."

They always keep their entire endowment and never contribute anything, despite consistently observing very high contributions from almost everyone else. Their behavior is extremely stable: there is no experimentation, no conditional cooperation, and no adjustment in response to being punished. They appear to follow a strictly self-maximizing, game-theoretic dominant-strategy logic toward the contribution decision, ignoring fairness norms and group efficiency considerations. There is no evidence of risk-taking for higher collective payoffs; they reliably choose the individually safe, selfish option even when it repeatedly provokes costly sanctions.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nAwareness of the finite horizon does not change their strategy. They maintain the same zero-contribution pattern from start to finish, including the final round. There is no observable cooperation decay because cooperation is absent from the outset; likewise, there is no last-round “grab” since they are already fully exploiting the group throughout. This suggests either a fixed rule (“never contribute”) or a belief that others’ behavior and sanctions will not shift their incentives sufficiently at any point in the game.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey never use the punishment option, even though they themselves are repeatedly and heavily punished. They do not punish either low contributors or high contributors, despite clear information about others’ actions and identities. This indicates a strong reluctance to spend personal resources on sanctioning, whether for norm enforcement, deterrence, or retaliation. Their stance is consistent with second-order free riding on others’ willingness to punish: they accept being disciplined by others but never participate in the costly enforcement system themselves. Motives for this could be strategic (preserving own payoff) or disinterest in moralistic aggression; which of these dominates is unknown.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nThey experience substantial and repeated punishments from several group members, yet their behavior remains unchanged: they continue to contribute nothing and continue to avoid punishing in return. There is no evidence of retaliatory punishment, targeted counterattacks, or even selective adjustments toward the harshest punishers. There is also no sign of compliance with the implied cooperation norm; they do not “learn the lesson” that the group is trying to teach. This pattern suggests a high tolerance for being sanctioned and/or a belief that changing strategy would not be worthwhile. Emotionally, whether they feel resentment, indifference, or confusion is unknown, but behaviorally they are non-retaliatory and non-responsive.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey never use rewards, despite persistent and often very high contributions by others. They ignore opportunities to positively reinforce cooperative partners or to signal gratitude or alliance. Given that rewards are relatively inefficient, this could reflect a payoff-focused calculation, but the absence of any token or symbolic reward also points to very low concern for prosocial signaling or relational strategies. They neither strategically reward to shape future behavior nor altruistically reward to acknowledge others’ generosity.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThey receive small rewards on occasion but do not reciprocate in any way, either by rewarding back or by increasing their contributions. Being rewarded has no visible effect on their subsequent behavior. This indicates that they do not treat rewards as part of a reciprocal exchange relationship, nor do they appear to value the implicit social gesture enough to adjust their strategy. Rewarders remain unreciprocated, and the player stays a strict free rider.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey observe others consistently investing in the public good and frequently spending additional resources to punish defectors and occasionally to reward cooperators. Despite this, they do not adapt. High cooperators often earn more than they do, especially when punishments against the focal player are strong, but the player does not move toward the more profitable cooperative pattern. This suggests either a strong adherence to a predetermined rule or low engagement with comparative payoff information. They also see that certain other players who deviate slightly from the high-cooperation norm get punished, yet they do not join these partial free riders or adjust toward any intermediate strategy. Overall, they show minimal behavioral learning from others’ payoffs, sanctions, or rewards; they remain a passive observer who lets others shape the social environment while they persist in pure first- and second-order free riding."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThe player fits a “quiet, profit‑maximizing free rider with occasional conformity” type. Their baseline is to keep almost all of their endowment and contribute minimally, even when others contribute fully and explicitly advocate universal giving. They do not match the prevailing norm of full contribution and never sustain high contributions across time. Their contributions fluctuate between very low and moderate levels rather than converging on a stable pattern, suggesting opportunistic experimentation rather than a principled norm.\n\nThey clearly prioritize individual payoff over group efficiency: they repeatedly choose contribution levels that maximize their private returns in the given environment, even when a stable, high‑contribution norm is visible and reinforced in chat. Occasional higher contributions appear sporadic and are not tied to any expressed reasoning or explicit coordination, so their underlying decision rule is unknown; however, those higher contributions do not persist when they see that others continue contributing high amounts regardless of their own behavior.\n\nThey show no visible fairness norm: they regularly contribute far less than the group while benefiting from others’ generosity, without any evident attempt to “make up for it” later or to track proportionality. Their risk tolerance regarding potential social sanctions is high; they free ride openly in the presence of identifiable partners and critical chat but do not adjust towards more cooperative behavior in response to social pressure alone.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThe player remains completely silent in chat throughout the game. They neither defend their low contributions nor attempt to justify or explain themselves. They ignore explicit appeals to cooperate, ignore light shaming, and do not respond to attempts to build a sense of group solidarity. This points to an avoidant or non‑engaging communication style: they do not use verbal channels for coordination, signaling, or reputation management.\n\nBecause they never speak, their sensitivity to social approval, guilt, or shame is unknown; what is observable is that they do not act to manage others’ impressions via communication. They also pass up the opportunity to influence others’ behavior through persuasion, even though others are clearly using chat to try to maintain cooperation. This suggests they rely on unilateral payoff optimization and are not inclined to invest effort in social influence.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThe player appears aware of the finite horizon but does not display a clear change in strategy at the very end: they already free ride heavily for much of the game, and they continue to do so near and at the end. There is no visible late‑game “collapse” in cooperation on their part, because they never commit to a high‑cooperation regime long enough for a decay pattern to emerge.\n\nThey do not respond behaviorally to others’ references to the game being almost finished in any distinctive way; their contribution stays low even as the game closes. Thus, any sophisticated end‑game reasoning about backward induction is hard to distinguish from their standing tendency to free ride. At minimum, they do not use the final rounds to reciprocate past generosity or repair norms; they maintain the same low‑communication, low‑contribution stance through to the last round.\n\n<REWARD>\nThe player never pays to reward anyone, despite being repeatedly exposed to a group where others are contributing generously and where the reward technology is clearly explained. They forgo rewarding even when they personally benefit a great deal from others’ high contributions and when reward could theoretically help sustain the cooperative norm that advantages them.\n\nThis indicates a strong reluctance to incur personal cost for prosocial signaling or norm support. They do not use rewards strategically to encourage others, to build alliances, or to express gratitude. Whether this is due to not valuing social reciprocity, not seeing reward as effective, or simply maximizing short‑term payoff is unknown; the only clear pattern is a consistent refusal to sacrifice coins for others’ benefit via reward.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThe player receives rewards from others at least twice but does not change their contribution pattern in a clearly cooperative direction afterward. They also do not reciprocate by rewarding in return, nor do they verbally acknowledge being rewarded. This implies very weak observable reciprocity: being rewarded does not trigger sustained higher contributions, does not elicit counter‑reward, and does not prompt any social signaling of appreciation.\n\nTheir internal beliefs about rewarders are unknown, but behaviorally they treat received rewards as windfall gains rather than as part of a reciprocal relationship. They do not appear to engage in alliance building or reputation dynamics; even with identifiable rewarders, they continue to act primarily as an individual profit maximizer rather than as a partner responding to targeted kindness."

This pattern is completely stable: there is no experimentation, no conditionality on others’ behavior, and no visible adjustment to changes in group contribution levels or punishment intensity. They behave as if the only relevant incentive is the immediate private payoff from keeping all coins, ignoring both efficiency gains from cooperation and any informal norm that contributors might be trying to establish. They do not appear to adopt fairness norms such as matching the group average or reciprocating high cooperation; they take full advantage of others’ generosity regardless of how cooperative or punitive the environment becomes. Risk tolerance regarding social sanction is high: they continue to free-ride despite being repeatedly and heavily punished, suggesting either a deliberate willingness to absorb sanctions as a “cost of doing business” or a disregard for norm enforcement.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nunknown. There is no observable chat content from this player in the transcript, so their tone, persuasion style, and responsiveness in communication are not inferable. It is unknown whether they attempt to justify free-riding, to coordinate, or simply remain silent. Engagement vs avoidance style in chat is therefore unknown.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThis player shows no discernible end-game shift. Their strategy is static: they free-ride from the beginning through the final round without any increase in contributions or strategic change as the horizon approaches. Even when the game nears its end, they do not attempt to “repair” relations with contributors, avoid punishment by briefly conforming, or exploit a final-round “grab” (they are already maximally grabbing from the start). This suggests they behave as if each round is independent or as if the only relevant consideration is short-run private income, not dynamic reputation or future consequences. They show awareness of neither cooperation decay nor last-round coordination; their pattern is flat and unresponsive to the game’s remaining length.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThis player never uses the punishment mechanism at all. Across all rounds, they spend nothing on punishing others despite facing sustained and often severe punishment themselves. They do not retaliate against those who are likely punishing them, do not try to discipline low contributors (there are others contributing zero in some periods), and do not use punishment strategically to deter future sanctions or shape group behavior. This indicates a strong reluctance or refusal to incur personal cost for norm enforcement, even when such enforcement might increase their own future payoffs by encouraging cooperation or reducing targeted punishment on them. Their motives appear purely payoff-maximizing in the short run: they avoid any costly social action, whether “prosocial” (punishing defectors) or “antisocial” (retaliating), and accept being the target rather than spending to fight back. From a type perspective, they act as a non-punishing, non-enforcing free-rider who does not invest in any form of costly sanctioning.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThis player’s behavior appears strikingly insensitive to others’ outcomes. They keep free-riding even as cooperative players suffer from heavy punishment by others, even as overall cooperation levels fluctuate, and even as their own payoff is repeatedly reduced by deductions. They do not seem to condition on who is being punished or rewarded; they do not respond when contributors are targeted, nor when other free-riders exist, nor when punishment intensity or focus changes across group members. There is no observable attempt to exploit shifts in who is being sanctioned, no strategic mimicry of higher earners, and no adaptation when their own earnings fall substantially due to punishment. This suggests either that they are not paying attention to the rich feedback about others’ payoffs and sanction patterns, or that they notice but discount it heavily relative to the simple rule “contribute nothing.” Their type can thus be characterized as a rigid, payoff-focused free-rider who neither learns from nor strategically reacts to others’ contributions, punishments, or resulting payoffs."

They consistently contribute nothing to the public fund in all situations, regardless of how much others give or how cooperative the group is. Their strategy is stable and non-conditional: they do not adjust contributions upward in response to widespread high contributions, nor downward when some others defect. They appear unconcerned with fairness norms around proportional giving, and they show no evidence of sacrificing own coins for efficiency or group benefit. Risk tolerance regarding social backlash is high; they persist in full defection despite recurrent punishment from others, suggesting they either discount the likelihood or severity of retaliation, or they value their chosen stance more than the cost imposed on them. There is no sign of conditional cooperation or reciprocity on the contribution dimension.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nUnknown. There is no chat content in the transcript, so their tone, persuasion attempts, and responsiveness in explicit communication are not observable. Their interactional style must be inferred behaviorally: they remain behaviorally unresponsive to whatever norms or expectations others implicitly express through high contributions and repeated punishment, which is consistent with a low-communication or non-coordinative stance, but this is speculative (low confidence).\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThey show no end-game decay in cooperation because they never cooperate at any point; contribution behavior remains at zero throughout. Their punishment behavior, however, remains active and sometimes intensive even in the final phase, rather than tapering off. They continue to spend nontrivial amounts on punishment, including in the last rounds, indicating they remain engaged with norm enforcement or retaliation until the very end rather than switching to a purely payoff-maximizing “take and ignore” strategy. They appear horizon-aware in the sense that the game length is visible, but they do not reduce punishment intensity toward the end; if anything, they are willing to make very costly punishment choices late, suggesting they prioritize expressing disapproval, retaliating, or enforcing their own norms over maximizing final earnings.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey are a heavy and persistent user of costly punishment while simultaneously being a full free-rider. They frequently spend substantial portions of their payoff punishing others, sometimes to the point of drastically lowering their own round earnings. This indicates that they are not payoff-maximizing in a narrow monetary sense; they accept significant personal cost in order to impose losses on others.\n\nTheir targeting is not fully inferable, but some patterns are plausible (medium to low confidence):\n- They repeatedly face punishment from others, yet they continue punishing in subsequent rounds, suggesting a strong retaliatory or spiteful component: they are willing to escalate or sustain punishment conflicts rather than de-escalate.\n- They appear to direct punishment at both low contributors and high contributors at different times (inferred from changes in others’ deductions and from the fact that they never contribute themselves). This suggests that their punishment is not driven by a standard “pro-social” norm of punishing defectors on behalf of cooperation, but more by personal grievances, perceived slights, or idiosyncratic norms.\n- They sometimes punish very heavily in rounds where others are contributing generously, which is inconsistent with classic altruistic punishment and more consistent with anti-social punishment or vendetta-like behavior.\n\nOverall, they function as an anti-social punisher: they do not cooperate yet are willing to pay materially to harm others. Their punishment does not appear to be used strategically to increase future cooperation—the group remains highly cooperative without any contribution from them, and their own behavior does not change—so deterrence of defection is unlikely to be their primary motive. Instead, motives likely include retaliation against those who punish them, expression of hostility, or an attempt to reduce others’ relative advantage.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey are repeatedly punished by others, sometimes quite heavily, but do not adjust their free-riding in response, indicating low responsiveness to social sanctions in terms of contributions. Instead of conforming, they answer sanctions with continued or escalated punishment spending, consistent with a reactive or vengeful stance: when others’ outcomes show that someone has invested in punishing, they are more likely to keep engaging in the punishment environment rather than withdraw.\n\nThey also seem sensitive to relative payoffs: they often choose to sacrifice their own earnings in order to reduce others’ payoffs, even in rounds where others are doing well and contributing a lot, which suggests some concern with not letting others “get ahead” uncontested. However, they do not alter their own cooperative behavior to improve group outcomes; their response channel is almost exclusively punitive rather than constructive. Thus, when they observe others receiving high payoffs from cooperation, their typical adjustment is to impose monetary harm, not to join the cooperative pattern.\n\nIn sum, their behavioral type combines strict free-riding with active, sometimes extreme, punishment use that is not clearly aligned with cooperative norms, and a notable resistance to learning or adjusting in response to others’ sanctioning behavior."

They exhibit no detectable fairness norm in favor of contributing; they accept benefiting from others’ contributions while giving nothing in return.\n\nThey appear to understand the incentive structure and exploit the fact that others sometimes contribute. They are willing to let others bear all the contribution cost and simply collect the redistributed benefit when available. When others stop contributing, they still do not change course, indicating that they value maximizing their own short-term payoff per round over any group-efficiency or fairness concerns. Risk tolerance regarding future group retaliation is irrelevant here because punishment/reward is disabled; within this environment they behave as if there is no strategic cost to being blatantly selfish.\n\nOverall, their type aligns with a payoff-maximizing, non-cooperative defector who does not condition on others’ past or current contributions.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThere is no discernible end-game shift in strategy because the player defects from the very beginning and maintains that strategy through to the very last round. Awareness of the remaining rounds does not visibly alter their behavior; they do not “coast” into defection after early cooperation because cooperation never occurs at all.\n\nIf anything, the consistent refusal to contribute, even when others continue to do so late in the game, suggests that they treat every round as an independent opportunity to free-ride rather than part of a broader relational or reputational horizon.

Their horizon awareness is behaviorally irrelevant given their already fully non-cooperative baseline.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThis player’s contribution pattern is completely insensitive to others’ outcomes.

Likewise, when others also defect and their relative advantage disappears, they still do not contribute to restore higher joint payoffs. This suggests they either prioritize absolute self-payoff over group efficiency and equality, or they are indifferent to both others’ payoffs and the collective surplus, focusing narrowly on keeping their own endowment each round. Their beliefs about others’ motives and preferences are unknown; all that is observable is a consistent lack of behavioral response to social or payoff information."

They appear strongly payoff-maximizing at the individual level, prioritizing their own immediate returns over group efficiency or fairness. There is no visible concern for matching others’ behavior or for appearing fair, despite repeated, targeted punishment against them. Across the game they show no volatility in contribution decisions, indicating a fixed, prior strategy rather than ongoing experimentation or risk-driven adjustment. Their risk tolerance with respect to social sanctions seems high: they accept substantial deductions without changing their contribution behavior, implying they either discount social disapproval or judge that continued free-riding still serves their interests better than cooperating.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThis player never uses the punishment mechanism. They refrain from punishing even when they are repeatedly and heavily punished, and even when clear free-riders besides themselves emerge. This suggests a strong reluctance to incur personal cost to sanction others, whether for norm enforcement or retaliation. There is no evidence of targeted punishment aimed at defectors, nor any symbolic or emotional “reply” to prior punishers. Their stance is thus both non-norm-enforcing and non-retaliatory. The pattern is consistent with a strategy of minimizing personal costs, including the costs of punishing, and accepting whatever sanctions others impose rather than engaging in costly conflict. Whether they see punishment as illegitimate, inefficient, or simply not worth the expense is unknown, but in practice they behave as a pure non-punisher.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nWhen others punish them, this player does not change their contribution behavior or begin punishing in return. They absorb even strong and repeated sanctions without any observable shift in strategy. There is no evidence of direct retaliation toward identifiable punishers, indicating either emotional detachment, deliberate restraint, or a purely calculative stance that deems retaliation not worthwhile. They also do not “comply” with the social signal that high contributors and punishers are sending; their contributions remain at zero despite escalating or persistent punishments. Overall, their response style is passive and unreactive: they neither seek reconciliation nor revenge, and they do not adapt in a cooperative direction in response to being targeted.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThis player observes that most others often contribute fully and that many invest substantial amounts in punishing non-contributors, yet they do not appear to imitate or reciprocate those cooperative or norm-enforcing choices.

They seem to treat others’ outcomes—both high cooperative payoffs and costly punishment behavior—as background conditions rather than as signals that alter their plan. There is no evidence that they reward or “reward-by-not-punishing” anyone based on high contributions; they simply ignore outcome differences and continue maximizing their own short-term take.

Fairness and reciprocity norms appear to have no observable influence on their choices; maximizing own private payoff from the stage game seems to dominate. They tolerate substantial social and monetary risk (including very large deduction attacks) without altering their zero-contribution strategy, suggesting either a strong commitment to free-riding, indifference to social approval, or a belief that adjustment would not sufficiently change others’ behavior.

This absence holds regardless of who contributes how much or who is punished or rewarded by others. There is no sign of norm-enforcing punishment, strategic punishment to shape others’ contributions, or revenge-type punishment in response to harm. This suggests either a strong aversion to sacrificing own payoff for norm enforcement, or a belief that punishment is ineffective or not worth the cost.

They do not use reward to encourage cooperators, to signal gratitude, or to build alliances or goodwill that might protect them from punishment. The reward technology is relatively efficient, but they still refrain from ever using it, suggesting that any value they place on others’ welfare, reciprocity, or strategic reputation-building is outweighed by their desire to conserve own payoff each round. They do not appear to adopt a “carrot-and-stick” strategy at all; instead, they ignore the reward channel and treat others’ rewarding behavior as irrelevant for their own actions.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey are repeatedly punished and occasionally rewarded but exhibit no observable behavioral adaptation: contributions remain at zero and their use of punishment and reward remains at zero throughout. Massive deduction episodes directed at them do not change their strategy, implying either a very strong commitment to their initial plan, low sensitivity to social sanctions, or skepticism that changing would improve their longer-term outcome. They also do not copy or respond to others’ heavy use of punishment or generous reward; the variability and sometimes extreme spending by others does not trigger imitation or counter-behavior. They appear to treat others’ payoffs, punishment costs, and reward costs as background information rather than as signals to integrate into their decisions. Overall, they behave as a rigid, self-focused defector type: they free-ride regardless of group norms, do not invest in influencing others, and do not update in response to social or monetary feedback from the group."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a steadfast unconditional cooperator. They consistently allocate their entire endowment to the public fund in every situation, regardless of others’ behavior or the recent payoff environment. Their contribution pattern is extremely stable and shows no strategic adjustment to free‑riding, partial cooperation, or shifts in group norms. They uphold a strong fairness norm that “everyone should put everything in” and treat this as the obvious or correct rule, explicitly advocating this norm in group communication and never deviating from it themselves.\n\nThey appear insensitive to short‑term individual payoff maximization: they continue full cooperation even when others repeatedly under‑contribute and when returns from the public fund are relatively low. There is no observable risk‑hedging or conditional cooperation; they do not experiment with lower contributions to test others, nor do they reduce contributions in response to persistent defectors. Their behavior is consistent with a principled or norm‑driven type rather than an outcome‑driven or strategic type. Whether this stems from intrinsic pro‑social preferences, a desire to be “the good player,” or misunderstanding of the payoff structure is unknown, although their explanations to others suggest they do understand that group payoffs are maximized when all contribute fully.\n\nThey show patience with temporary miscoordination: even when others misunderstand the mechanism or reverse their decisions, this player maintains full contributions and instead uses communication to clarify what should be done.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nTheir tone is friendly, brief, and cooperative. They engage early with a simple greeting and then use the chat primarily to support coordination around full contributions. They explicitly endorse the “everyone contributes everything” strategy and later clarify how the decision interface should be interpreted, indicating that they are both attentive to others’ confusion and willing to help correct it.\n\nThey are responsive to social dynamics: when another player seems to imply that some birds are not cooperating, they defend their own cooperative status without aggression, asking for clarification in a neutral way. They express positive reinforcement when the group finally reaches high, synchronized contributions again, celebrating the restored cooperation with a short appreciative comment. Their communication style is low‑volume but targeted: they speak when it can help coordination, clear up misunderstandings, or affirm group success, rather than chatting for its own sake.\n\nThey do not pressure or shame specific individuals; instead, they talk in general terms about what “we” should do and about how the interface should read. This suggests a mild, prosocial, norm‑setting style rather than a confrontational or punitive one. They respond to others’ apologies and confusion by offering constructive guidance, not blame. Overall, they engage but do not dominate the conversation, and they use language to align the group around cooperative norms.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey never spend any coins on reward, even when others clearly cooperate and even when they themselves receive rewards from others multiple times. Their willingness to reward is therefore either zero or extremely low in this environment. They do accept and acknowledge cooperative behavior via chat (e.g., verbally affirming when the group finally all contributes fully again), but they do not translate that approval into use of the formal reward mechanism.\n\nGiven that the cost and benefit of reward are symmetric here, the lack of rewarding is not obviously profit‑maximizing versus neutral; it is more consistent with an assumption that formal reward is unnecessary, that cooperation should be its own norm without side payments, or that they prioritize keeping their own payoff once they have already contributed fully. They may view full contribution as sufficient pro‑social action and see additional reward spending as redundant or costly without added value. They also never appear to threaten or promise reward in chat, nor do they mention the reward mechanism, indicating it is not central to their strategy.\n\nTheir reinforcement of norms is thus primarily verbal and by example rather than through incentive manipulation. They rely on modeling perfect cooperation and using brief, positive communication to guide others, rather than paying to selectively reinforce behavior. Whether they would reward in a setting where reward is more clearly efficacious or differently structured is unknown."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a stable, unconditional high contributor. They always give the full endowment to the public good, showing no apparent sensitivity to others’ free riding, to changing group composition, or to the remaining number of rounds. They accept being exploited by lower contributors rather than lowering their own contribution. Their behavior is consistent with a strong cooperation norm or intrinsic preference for contributing, not with payoff-maximizing conditional cooperation. There is no evidence that they try to “discipline” defectors by reducing their own contributions; instead they maintain full cooperation throughout, even when that is clearly costly relative to others’ choices. Risk tolerance appears high in the sense of repeatedly trusting the group to cooperate despite mixed evidence.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThey communicate rarely but align verbally with cooperative norms. When another player proposes universal maximum contributions, they explicitly agree and thereby endorse the cooperative plan. They do not initiate strategy discussions, challenge defectors, or respond to later chat about mistakes or defection. Their style is low-engagement and non-confrontational: they support cooperation when prompted but do not try to persuade, coordinate rewards, or correct confusion. They also never use chat to complain about free riding or about the unequal burden they bear, suggesting a preference to avoid social conflict or a focus on their own rule-following rather than on social enforcement.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThey show no discernible end-game defection. Their contribution pattern remains fully cooperative through the final rounds, including when others intermittently defect and when the remaining horizon is short and transparent. They do not appear to reduce contributions as the end approaches, nor do they escalate or taper their reward use in a way that clearly reflects end-game planning; reward usage is intermittent throughout, with no clear last-round spike or shutdown tied specifically to the game’s conclusion. Overall, their strategy appears horizon-insensitive: they behave similarly in early, middle, and final rounds, which is consistent with a rule-based cooperative type rather than a backward-inducting strategist.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey do reward, but sparingly and in a somewhat irregular pattern. They are willing to incur personal cost to give rewards, indicating that they value reinforcing good behavior or reciprocating kindness at least occasionally. However, most rounds they choose not to spend on rewards, even when others fully cooperate. Their reward behavior does not consistently track any single simple rule (such as “reward all cooperators” or “reward everyone when all contribute”). Instead, they sometimes reward in cooperative environments and sometimes refrain under very similar conditions. This suggests that while they understand and accept the mechanism, they are either conserving resources, experimenting, or are not strongly motivated to use rewards as a systematic enforcement tool. There is also no clear evidence that they use rewards to punish defectors indirectly (e.g., rewarding everyone except defectors); often they simply do nothing, even alongside clear free riding.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThey receive rewards from others in many cooperative rounds but never explicitly acknowledge this in chat. There is some weak evidence of reciprocity in that their limited reward spending tends to occur in contexts where they themselves are being rewarded and the group is cooperative, but the pattern is inconsistent and does not clearly target specific benefactors. They do not appear to build explicit alliances via selective rewarding, nor do they engage in mutual reward escalations with any one player. In social terms, they accept being rewarded but do not visibly use the reward tool to cultivate long-term reciprocal ties or to thank particular partners; any reciprocity is, at best, low-key and unsignaled.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey observe others’ contributions, rewards given, and resulting payoffs yet do not adjust their own contributions in response, indicating a tolerance for unequal outcomes at the contribution stage. Their willingness to keep fully contributing despite repeated free riding implies either a strong fairness norm focused on “doing their part” rather than on outcome equality, or a low concern for relative disadvantage. In the reward stage, they mostly refrain from reacting, even when others incur substantial reward costs or concentrate rewards on certain players. Their occasional reward spending does not track precise payoff disparities and shows no clear targeting of high-cost cooperators or exclusion of exploiters. They also do not comment on others’ heavy reward spending or on their higher payoffs when they free ride, suggesting limited emotional or strategic response to payoff distributions, and a primary focus on maintaining their own consistent cooperative behavior."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is an almost perfectly unconditional full cooperator. They consistently contribute the maximum possible amount in essentially every round, including early and late in the game, and they revert immediately to full contribution after a single deviation. Their one deviation is an abrupt switch to zero contribution after a long stretch of unanimous full cooperation, which is then immediately punished by the group. After experiencing that punishment, they resume full contributions and maintain them through the end. This pattern suggests that their default norm is “everyone gives everything,” and they are willing to test a selfish deviation once, but they treat the group’s negative response as binding and fall back into the cooperative norm. There is no evidence that they condition their contribution on others’ prior contributions, since others are always fully cooperative; their lone defection seems more like opportunistic experimentation than a response to observed unfairness. They do not appear to chase short‐term profit aggressively; after being sanctioned, they prioritize staying aligned with the group. Risk tolerance around norms is moderate: they risk a single, conspicuous free ride despite strong group talk of always giving, but once sanctioned, they do not push further. Overall, they behave as a high, stable cooperator whose contributions are guided more by group expectations and maintaining harmony than by detailed payoff calculations.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nTheir communication is sparse, light, and affiliative rather than strategic. They occasionally respond to others with short, friendly comments and mild humor, and they explicitly affirm that they will follow the group’s cooperative plan when others endorse full contribution. They do not initiate complex coordination schemes or propose detailed reward/punishment strategies, but they readily agree when other players discuss general cooperative norms or collective plans. They acknowledge shared experiences (like waiting for the game to start) and show a tendency to validate others rather than to criticize. Their engagement style is reactive and low-effort: they speak when prompted by others’ remarks or when the social tone invites small talk, but they do not use chat to negotiate incentive structures, enforce norms, or question others’ behavior. Even when other players discuss mutual rewarding to improve earnings, they remain silent on that strategic discussion and later simply signal agreement in principle without changing their own action pattern. Overall, they present as socially agreeable, deferential to group norms, and conflict-averse, with minimal use of communication as a tool for influence.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey never use punishment, even when they are the clear target of punishment after their own free-riding attempt. This indicates a strong reluctance to engage in retaliatory behavior or to use sanctions as a normative tool. They do not punish low contributors (including themselves when they defect), nor do they respond to being punished with counter-punishment or visible indignation. The absence of any punishment use, despite experiencing a substantial sanction, suggests they either (a) disapprove of spending resources to harm others, (b) strongly prioritize avoiding escalation and conflict, or (c) focus narrowly on their own payoff without seeing punishment as a worthwhile investment. Because other players maintain full contributions, they never face a choice about punishing chronic defectors; hence their stance on third-party punishment of others’ unfairness is unknown. However, their pattern is consistent with a non-punitive, non-confrontational type who absorbs sanctions and adjusts behavior rather than trying to discipline others.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey also never use rewards, despite repeated periods where others are fully cooperative and despite group discussion about using mutual rewards to raise earnings. This shows an unwillingness to spend personal resources to positively reinforce others, even when the group frames symmetrical mutual rewarding as profitable. They receive nontrivial amounts of reward from others and sometimes acknowledge group plans verbally in a supportive way, but they do not reciprocate via the mechanism itself. This combination—accepting rewards, continuing to cooperate, but not giving rewards—suggests a type who values cooperation enough to contribute fully, but either does not internalize the additional norm of active reciprocity through costly reward, or evaluates the reward mechanism as not worth its cost. Their non-use persists even when others explicitly revisit and endorse mutual rewarding near the end, which indicates that it is a stable preference rather than inattention. Overall, they are a high contributor who free-rides on others’ reward efforts: they benefit from others’ generosity without engaging in strategic reinforcement themselves, and they rely on basic contribution norms rather than incentive engineering to sustain cooperation."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a strict, unconditional full contributor. They always give their entire endowment to the public fund, without deviation and without needing explicit assurances from others. Their behavior indicates they understand that full group cooperation yields very high returns and they are comfortable trusting the group to maintain this standard. They do not condition their contribution level on rewards, punishments, or small deviations by others; even after a visible defection, they maintain maximal contribution rather than cutting back. This suggests a strong, stable cooperation norm rather than a reactive or contingent one. They appear risk-tolerant with respect to potential free-riding: they prioritize maintaining the cooperative equilibrium and high group payoffs over protecting themselves against occasional exploitation. Fairness for them seems to mean “everyone contributing fully,” and they act as if that standard is both expected and achievable.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nTheir tone is friendly, succinct, and cooperative. They endorse the high-contribution strategy explicitly and frame it as a shared “plan” for “big bonuses,” reinforcing group norms rather than arguing or lecturing. They sometimes ask simple clarification or coordination questions (for example about whether everyone is rewarding) and occasionally make brief motivational comments about earning more money. They acknowledge others’ coordination proposals and express agreement, even when they do not fully follow through behaviorally later. They do not challenge or confront others directly about their actions; even when someone defects, they do not call them out in chat. Instead, they use chat mainly to reinforce collective strategies, signal generosity (“I give everyone”), and align verbally with group-wide reward schemes. Their engagement style is cooperative and encouraging but low-intensity: they participate enough to coordinate, not to dominate the conversation or negotiate in detail.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey almost never use punishment and show no interest in retaliatory behavior generally. The sole instance of punishment occurs immediately after the only clear defection from full contribution. In that case, they target the lone defector and apply a substantial sanction, while leaving all other players untouched. This pattern is highly selective and consistent with a norm-enforcing motive: punishment is reserved for clear, unambiguous deviation from a well-established full-contribution standard. They do not punish anyone else at any other time, even when discussions around rewards, fairness, and earnings might have given them justification to sanction “under-rewarders.” This suggests they view punishment as a tool to deter outright free-riding on contributions, not to fine-tune fairness in the reward stage or to retaliate for low generosity. Their willingness to bear a nontrivial personal cost to punish a single defector indicates a commitment to protecting the cooperative norm, but they keep punishment rare and targeted rather than using it routinely.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey are a high, sometimes extreme, rewarder with a strong inclination toward inclusive generosity. They frequently spend significant resources to give positive incentives to others, often distributing rewards broadly and symmetrically across all cooperating peers. This behavior is consistent with a strategy of reinforcing the fully cooperative equilibrium and signaling goodwill rather than maximizing immediate personal payoff. At several points they experiment with giving no rewards or selectively rewarding just one or a few partners, suggesting some sensitivity to their own net earnings and to whether others are also rewarding. However, they repeatedly return to wide, almost egalitarian reward distributions, and explicitly describe themselves as giving to everyone. They do not appear to condition rewards on fine-grained differences in others’ behavior; as long as others are contributing fully and broadly aligned with the group, they tend to treat them similarly. The single defector receives no reward and instead is punished, showing that rewards are reserved for cooperators. Overall, they use reward as a primary tool to sustain cooperation and express solidarity, accepting short-run personal costs in exchange for maintaining a generous, high-trust environment."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a stable, unconditional full cooperator. They always contribute their entire endowment, showing no sensitivity to marginal personal returns, free-riding opportunities, or small deviations by others. Their behavior suggests a strong internal norm to “do the socially efficient thing” and maintain maximum group provision, independent of short-term self-interest. They do not appear to condition their actions on others’ exact contribution levels; even when one group member briefly contributes less, they continue to fully cooperate without punishment, reduction, or visible protest. This indicates high tolerance for minor norm deviations and a preference for norm stability over reactive adjustment. The player appears comfortable bearing the risk that others may not fully match their cooperation; they prioritize the collective outcome and adherence to a simple “always contribute everything” rule rather than calibrating contributions to protect themselves.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThe player does not send any chat messages, despite others using chat to encourage cooperation. This reflects a silent, non-leadership communication style: they neither initiate coordination nor verbally reinforce emerging norms. Instead, they “speak” through their consistent contributions. Their lack of verbal engagement suggests either low desire to manage others’ behavior directly, low need for social signaling via talk, or simple preference/comfort with passive participation. They are nonetheless responsive in the behavioral sense: they align their contributions with the emerging high-cooperation norm, but they do not explicitly praise, pressure, or negotiate with teammates. Overall, they are a quiet cooperator who supports group goals through action rather than words.\n\n<REWARD>\nThe player never uses the reward mechanism, even when others are clearly cooperating at high and stable levels and when rewarders are identifiable to recipients. This indicates a strong reluctance to spend personal resources on direct positive incentives or gratitude payments, even in a fully cooperative environment. Their strategy appears to be: contribute maximally, but do not pay extra to influence or thank others. This could reflect several possibilities (all with low confidence): they may view contribution itself as sufficient cooperation; they may not see additional benefit from rewarding in an already cooperative group; they may be conserving payoff; or they may be indifferent or uncomfortable with active, targeted social interventions. There is no evidence that their decision to withhold reward is punitive; it is uniformly applied and not contingent on others’ actions. They are thus best described as a “non-rewarding cooperator”: they help via public good contributions but do not invest in second-order cooperation through reward.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nNo rewards are given to this player, so their response to being rewarded is unknown. There is no evidence about whether they would reciprocate rewards, form alliances with rewarders, or shift behavior after receiving recognition. Given their general pattern, the safest characterization is that their contribution behavior likely remains stable and high regardless of social reinforcement, but this is inferred with low confidence and not directly observed."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a stable, unconditional high contributor. They always contribute the full endowment in every available decision, including early, mid, and final rounds, despite substantial variation in others’ behavior and despite explicit calls from others to stop contributing near the end. Their cooperation is not contingent on short‑term reciprocation, group averages, or end‑game incentives; they continue to contribute even when free‑riding is visibly profitable and socially endorsed by some others. This indicates a strong internal norm favoring contribution over individual payoff maximization, low willingness to exploit others even when safe, and a readiness to accept payoff disadvantage relative to free riders. Risk tolerance appears moderate: they are willing to “see how things go” early on but ultimately stick with full cooperation regardless of outcome volatility. Their fairness concept seems group‑welfare‑oriented rather than payoff‑equality‑oriented, as they do not adjust contributions to punish defectors or to match the group’s declining average.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nTheir communication is sparse, neutral in tone, and non‑confrontational. They enter the conversation minimally and avoid criticizing or shaming low contributors or free riders, even when others do so. When they speak, they briefly acknowledge joining the cooperative effort and mention that they initially want to observe how the game unfolds before fully committing, which suggests a reflective and cautious mindset. They do not attempt to lead coordination, set explicit norms, or argue about the merits of rewarding or contributing; instead, they quietly align with the cooperative camp. They show no hostility or sarcasm and do not escalate conflicts between other players. Their style is low‑engagement but aligned with cooperation, preferring action (consistent contributions) over extended discussion or persuasion. Responsiveness beyond this is unknown due to limited chat content.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThey exhibit almost no classic end‑game defection. Even when others openly discuss that the final rounds are approaching and some advocate for withholding contributions, they continue to give the full amount. Knowledge of the finite horizon does not translate into reduced cooperation or a shift to self‑interested play. There is no observable last‑round “grab” behavior; instead, their pattern of full contribution persists unchanged. This suggests either a strong internalized cooperative principle that dominates backward‑induction logic, or a belief that sticking with cooperation is preferable even when it is not strategically rewarded in the short run. They do not join the explicit calls to refuse donating in late rounds, nor do they voice frustration about others’ end‑game free‑riding.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey never use the reward mechanism, despite being eligible every round and despite other players using it at least once in the environment. They are aware that rewarding exists (the interface message is shown repeatedly), yet they spend nothing on rewards and receive some reward only early on from others, not reciprocated by them. There is no evidence that they experiment with reward for strategic reinforcement, reciprocity, or norm‑setting. Combined with their consistent high contributions, this pattern resembles a “pure cooperator” who sees contribution as the main vehicle of cooperation and either finds formal rewarding unnecessary, unappealing, or not cost‑effective. Their silence in discussions about whether rewarding has any point leaves their valuation of the mechanism itself unknown, but behaviorally they ignore it entirely.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThey receive reward from at least one other player but never publicly acknowledge it, never comment on it in chat, and never reciprocate via the reward mechanism. There is no sign of alliance‑building, targeted thanks, or attempts to preferentially treat prior rewarders. Their contributions remain uniformly high to everyone, independent of who rewarded them earlier. This suggests that interpersonal gratitude signaling, if present internally, does not translate into strategic reward use or explicit social bonding in this setting. Whether they even notice the identity of the rewarder is unknown, but their observable behavior is non‑reciprocal with respect to rewards.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey do not comment on, or react explicitly to, others’ contribution levels, payoffs, or reward expenditures, even when non‑contributors are named and criticized by other players, and even when some players visibly earn much more by free‑riding. They refrain from moralizing, blaming, or defending any side. Their own contribution choices also show no conditional response to these outcomes: they keep contributing fully regardless of deteriorating group behavior, payoff gaps, or perceived unfairness. They also do not praise or reward generous contributors. This combination suggests a relatively detached stance toward others’ specific outcomes, with a focus on maintaining their own cooperative standard rather than adapting to or policing others’. Emotional reactions to others’ gains and losses are unknown; the observable stance is quiet, steady, and non‑reactive."

Their strategy does not appear to adjust to changes in group behavior, observed defection, or horizon effects. This suggests either a fixed norm of “always contribute” or a deliberate choice to prioritize group efficiency over individual earnings, regardless of others’ actions. They tolerate substantial exploitation by free-riders without retaliating or downgrading their own contributions. Their behavior is consistent with a strong cooperative or rule-following type rather than a conditional cooperator or payoff-maximizer.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThey speak minimally and only once, to offer a brief greeting at the start. They make no further comments on strategy, fairness, rewards, or others’ behavior, and they do not join norm-enforcement talk or shaming of free-riders. They do not try to persuade, coordinate, or react to emerging coalitions, even when others explicitly discuss contribution strategies and “refusing to donate.” This indicates a low-engagement, quiet style: they participate behaviorally through their contributions but not socially through chat. Their tone in the one message is neutral and polite; beyond that, their stance toward conflict, persuasion, or group governance is unknown.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThey maintain full contributions through to the final round, despite explicit reminders that it is the last round and clear suggestions from others to stop contributing. They show no observable end-game decay or attempt to exploit the final period. Awareness of the horizon is likely (the information is visible and discussed), but they do not act on it strategically. This pattern is consistent with a horizon-insensitive cooperative rule: they behave the same early and late in the game, even when short-term incentives to free-ride are strongest.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey never spend on rewards, even when others reward high contributors and when rewarding behavior is visible and identifiable. They do not experiment with targeted rewards, reciprocity, or coalition-building via positive incentives. Their refusal to engage with reward persists across conditions: when rewards are actively used by some, when they are not used by most, and when they could be used to reinforce cooperation or retaliate against non-cooperation. This suggests either that they view rewards as unnecessary or inefficient, that they are strongly payoff-conserving in this dimension, or that they simply choose a “no reward” rule and stick to it. They cooperate via contributions but avoid paying extra to shape others’ behavior.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThey receive a small amount of reward early in the game but never reciprocate to those who reward them or to other contributors. They also do not acknowledge reward in chat. There is no sign that being rewarded affects their later decisions about rewarding or contributing; their contributions remain maximally cooperative, and their use of the reward mechanism remains absent. This fits a type that is non-reciprocal in the formal reward channel: they neither build alliances through mutual rewarding nor respond to generosity with targeted payback. Whether they feel gratitude internally is unknown; behaviorally, they ignore the reward mechanism, both as giver and as strategic responder.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey show no behavioral reaction to others’ payoffs, reward expenditures, or free-riding. Despite visible exploitation by non-contributors and visible use of rewards by some players, they neither adjust contributions downward nor engage in sanctioning or compensatory rewarding. They do not comment in chat on others gaining more by not contributing, nor on the perceived unfairness or irrationality that other players discuss. Their choices stay fixed at full contribution, regardless of others’ earnings or strategies. This suggests a type that is either norm-driven (“I contribute because that’s what you’re supposed to do”) or extremely tolerant of unequal outcomes, with low inclination to enforce social norms or protect themselves against exploitation. Their beliefs about others’ motives and rationality are unknown; their behavior indicates that such beliefs, if present, do not alter their own cooperative rule."

They do not attempt detailed coordination on contribution levels, nor do they join the blame or targeting of specific low contributors. Their engagement style is low‑volume, with short, evaluative remarks rather than sustained dialogue or persuasion. They respond more to structural concerns (mechanism design, others’ aggregate behavior) than to interpersonal drama.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThey show no end‑game decay in cooperation. Even when others explicitly argue that, because the game is almost over, everyone should stop contributing, they continue to give fully. They appear aware that the game has a fixed, short horizon, but this does not alter their rule of behavior. They resist last‑round defection pressure and even express a negative judgment of those who follow it, implying a stable internal norm that is not relaxed at the end. There is no visible attempt to “cash out” or to exploit the final round.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey never use the reward option, despite being eligible every round and despite at least once receiving a reward from another player. Their earlier statement indicates skepticism about the instrumental value of rewarding, suggesting they see no payoff advantage or coordination benefit in spending coins this way. There is no evidence they use reward as reciprocity, as a signal of alliance, or as a way to promote cooperation. Their strategy with respect to prosocial incentives remains purely contribution‑based; they separate their willingness to cooperate from any willingness to incur extra costs to influence others through rewards.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThey receive a reward in one instance but do not respond in chat or through reciprocal rewarding. There is no observable gratitude, alliance formation, or attempt to reciprocate to that specific player or to reward anyone at all.

However, they do not comment on specific individuals’ payoffs, nor do they single out free‑riders or rewarders for praise or blame. When others coordinate around non‑contribution and some exploit high contributors, they react by criticizing the group as a whole rather than adjusting their own choices or engaging in targeted sanctioning. Overall, they observe outcome patterns enough to form a skeptical belief about rewards and a negative judgment of collective free‑riding, but they keep their own behavior fixed and avoid personalized responses to particular players’ gains or losses."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a stable, unconditional full cooperator across all rounds. They always give their entire endowment to the public good, regardless of what others do, how contributions around them fluctuate, or how close the game is to ending. They do not appear to condition their behavior on others’ past contributions, on observed free-riding, or on group-level trends; they continue to fully contribute even when many others clearly benefit more by withholding. This pattern suggests a strong internal norm or rule (“always contribute fully when MPCR is high”) rather than payoff-maximizing adaptation. They show high risk tolerance in the sense of willingly exposing themselves to exploitation and persistently accepting lower relative payoffs compared to defectors. Fairness concerns, if present, do not translate into reduced contributions; they do not attempt to restore equity via defection. Their strategy is cooperative, rigid, and non-retaliatory.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThey do not send any chat messages. They also do not visibly reference or react (via behavior shifts) to specific chat content. This indicates a low-engagement or silent participation style in communication channels: they listen (or at least observe outcomes) but remain nonverbal. They neither try to coordinate nor persuade others, and they do not publicly shame free-riders or praise cooperators. Their social style in this environment is passive and non-confrontational. It is unknown whether they internally care about others’ remarks or group norms; behaviorally, they abstain from explicit social interaction and let their contribution pattern speak for itself.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThey maintain full cooperation through the final round, despite clear awareness in the group that the game horizon is short and that many others are starting to deviate from full contributions. They do not shift to defection when others propose end-game non-cooperation, and they do not attempt to exploit the last round. There is no sign of cooperation decay in their play; their behavior is time-invariant from start to finish. This suggests either that they do not adopt backward-induction logic in their strategy, or that they follow a consistent principle that disregards the end-game incentive to free-ride. They also do not use the final round to experiment with alternative strategies like conditional defection or signaling.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey never use the reward mechanism. They do not reward high contributors, do not attempt to incentivize group cooperation, and do not reciprocate when others (if it occurred) reward someone else. Since they themselves are never rewarded, there is no observed opportunity to see direct reciprocal rewarding from them. Their unwillingness to spend on rewards holds even when rewarding might help reinforce a highly cooperative phase, and even though the cost/benefit is symmetric for giver and receiver. This pattern indicates a preference to avoid side-payments altogether, suggesting that they focus solely on direct contributions as their cooperative act. It is unknown whether they avoid rewarding because they see no strategic benefit, because they are conserving payoff, because they are confused about its purpose, or because they adhere to a norm of “cooperate but don’t engage in extra mechanisms.”\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThey are never observed receiving any reward, so there is no evidence of how they respond to being rewarded or of any reciprocal alliance-building. Consequently, their propensity to reward back benefactors, form stable cooperative subgroups via mutual rewards, or signal gratitude through the mechanism is unknown. Given their overall refusal to use rewards at any point, even without personal experience as a recipient, a reasonable (but still low-confidence) inference is that they would be unlikely to reciprocate even if rewarded; however, this remains speculative and should be treated as unknown.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey observe others’ outcomes and can see who defects and who contributes, as well as who spends on rewards, but they never adjust their own behavior in a way that reflects strategic reaction to these observations. They continue full contributions despite visible free-riding that gives others higher payoffs, and despite others experimenting with rewards. They neither join nor counteract emergent patterns of exploitation or retaliation via changing their own contribution level or using the reward tool. They do not appear to condition on the presence of extreme cooperators or extreme defectors; high-earning free-riders do not trigger any observable response. Their stance is behaviorally invariant: others’ payoffs, costs, and strategic moves do not modulate their actions. This suggests a type that is cooperative by principle rather than by contingent response to others’ outcomes, with learning or adaptation to the strategic landscape being minimal or absent (at least within this short game)."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a consistently full contributor: they always give their entire endowment. Their behavior indicates that they understand the efficiency of full contribution when the multiplier exceeds one, and they actively advocate for everyone to contribute the maximum. They appear strongly committed to a norm of universal full cooperation rather than conditionally matching others’ levels. Even after group deviation from the agreed high-contribution norm, they maintain full contribution instead of reducing their own to protect against exploitation, suggesting a preference for principled cooperation over short-term self-interest. Their risk tolerance seems relatively high: they are willing to expose themselves to being exploited by lower contributors if that aligns with the efficient, “correct” strategy in their understanding. Concerns about strict fairness in immediate payoffs are less salient than achieving group efficiency and sustaining a cooperative norm.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nTheir communication is brief, task-focused, and norm-oriented. They engage in the group conversation to clarify the “right” contribution level and use simple, reason-based persuasion, referencing the structure of the game to justify full contributions. The tone is cooperative and calm, with no visible sarcasm or hostility. They try to align the group on a clear rule for contributions and later on a clear rule for punishment, indicating a preference for explicit, shared norms. They respond directly to emerging group suggestions and build on them rather than ignoring them, but they do not chat for social bonding; their messages are instrumental, aimed at coordination and enforcement. Overall, they adopt an engaged but succinct style: they join the discussion at key decision points and then fall silent once the plan is set.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey do not actually spend on punishment in the observed game, but they explicitly propose using punishment as a deterrent against under-contribution. This suggests a willingness in principle to employ costly sanctions to enforce a cooperative norm, not in retaliation for personal harm but to uphold group-agreed standards. Their trigger for punishment appears to be deviation from a collectively endorsed maximum-contribution rule, especially when such deviation undermines efficiency. The timing of their proposal, coming after a successful period of full cooperation and just before some players reduce contributions, implies that they think about punishment as a forward-looking enforcement tool rather than as emotional revenge. However, because they never carry out punishment, their actual threshold for acting on this willingness and their selectivity among deviators remain unknown. Their internal weighing of punishment costs versus benefits is also unknown.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey observe others’ contributions and resulting payoffs but do not comment on specific individuals’ outcomes or complain about the distribution, even when they personally earn less than some partially contributing counterparts. They seem more concerned with whether everyone follows the cooperative rule than with the exact payoff ranking in any given round. Their push for punishment is framed around contribution behavior, not around who gained more or less in the last outcome, indicating that their focus is on norm compliance rather than envy or payoff comparison. They show no visible emotional reaction in chat to being relatively worse off when others reduce contributions, and they refrain from immediate punitive action despite having the opportunity, so their emotional sensitivity to inequity is unknown. The available evidence points to a player who tracks group behavior at a strategic level—who did or did not follow the norm—rather than dwelling on detailed payoff differences."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a primarily cooperative, mildly opportunistic contributor who generally follows the group norm of full contribution but occasionally free-rides when it seems unlikely to be noticed or sanctioned.\n\nThey overwhelmingly choose the maximal contribution option and maintain this across most of the game, even when others sometimes deviate. This suggests they accept the cooperative norm and are comfortable giving up the private endowment when they expect the group to do the same. Their contributions do not collapse over time; they repeatedly return to full contribution after deviations by others, so they do not display strong conditional cooperation in the sense of punishing defectors by systematically lowering their own contributions.\n\nAt a few points they contribute nothing despite high or near-unanimous contributions from others. These choices are infrequent and not followed by any explanation in chat, but they coincide with periods when overall cooperation is already strong and when the player is not being singled out in discussion. This pattern is consistent with occasional strategic free-riding: taking advantage of others’ contributions once a high-cooperation norm is established, while relying on the fact that no explicit sanction or tracking mechanism exists.\n\nThey do not verbally advocate for any contribution rule, do not try to enforce fairness norms, and do not publicly criticize low contributors. Their behavior suggests they internally value the higher payoffs from mutual cooperation but are also attentive to personal payoff maximization and willing to defect quietly when the social or reputational cost appears low. Risk tolerance appears moderate: they are willing to continue contributing even when some others defect, implying they are not highly loss-averse about “wasted” contributions, yet they also hedge with a few free-riding moves rather than naively contributing every time.\n\nOverall, their strategy is: “Contribute fully by default to preserve the cooperative environment and enjoy large group returns, but occasionally exploit the public good in a low-visibility way for extra personal gain,” without openly challenging or reinforcing norms in communication.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThis player’s communication is minimal, polite, and socially oriented rather than strategic. They offer a brief greeting at the start, explicitly state that they are a human participant when prompted, and later answer a casual, off-topic question about having eaten. They do not initiate discussions about strategy, incentives, or fairness, nor do they join others in trying to coordinate on contribution rules.\n\nThey never pressure others to contribute, never complain about low contributors, and never praise or thank high contributors. This indicates an avoidance of leadership or enforcement roles and a preference for blending into the group. They respond when directly or implicitly invited into simple social exchanges but otherwise remain quiet, suggesting a low-visibility, low-conflict engagement style.\n\nTheir tone is neutral to friendly, with no sarcasm, insults, or strong emotional expression. They show no evidence of trying to manipulate others’ beliefs about the game or the payoff structure, and they refrain from participating in the more intense norm-enforcement or joking that others engage in. Communication appears to serve identity confirmation and light social presence rather than coordination or persuasion.\n\nIn sum, they engage enough to appear cooperative and “present,” but they strategically stay out of any debates or norm-setting conversations, keeping a low profile that matches their mostly cooperative but occasionally opportunistic contribution behavior."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a “sociable conditional cooperator with opportunistic free‑riding.” They do not follow a single stable rule but alternate between full contribution and full defection, with a slight tilt toward contributing.\n\nThey readily contribute when group cooperation feels salient, when others are overtly coordinating on full contributions, or when they are socially engaged in the chat. They also sometimes contribute without any immediate pressure, suggesting that they accept the cooperative norm in principle and do not aim to purely maximize short‑term monetary payoff.\n\nAt the same time, they periodically free‑ride, especially in the middle and later parts of the game, even when cooperation is high. These zero‑contribution choices occur in situations where they can safely expect many others to contribute, indicating awareness of the material advantage of defection. They appear comfortable exploiting group cooperation intermittently rather than systematically; they do not consistently defect once cooperation is established, but rather “dip in and out” of free‑riding.\n\nTheir contribution pattern is thus volatile rather than monotonic: they oscillate between prosocial and selfish moves instead of showing a steady decay or unwavering cooperation. This suggests moderate risk tolerance and a willingness to experiment with both strategies, but without pushing the group into collapse.\n\nConditioning on others: they clearly pay attention to others’ behavior. When other players complain about non‑contributors or attempt to organize full contributions, this player tends to be on the contributing side, which indicates a responsiveness to social expectations and reputational concerns. However, this conditionality is imperfect: they still defect on some cooperative rounds, implying either limited self‑control, playful opportunism, or a lesser weight on fairness than on personal gain.\n\nThey show no explicit fairness enforcement: they neither shame low contributors nor lobby them directly. Their own intermittent defection suggests that they do not hold a strict “everyone must always give” fairness norm. Instead they seem comfortable with a “mostly cooperative, sometimes selfish” equilibrium, as long as the group continues to function.\n\nUnder uncertainty about the number of rounds, they do not visibly shift into an end‑game collapse pattern; their last decisions still mix cooperation and defection. This points to relatively weak backward‑induction reasoning or to a preference for maintaining the social game over perfectly timing exploitation.\n\nOverall, their strategy is: contribute often enough to sustain cooperation and social approval, but occasionally exploit high‑contribution environments to boost personal payoff, without openly challenging group norms.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nTone is light, playful, and affiliative. The player engages early and consistently with the social side of the game, asking where others are from, joking about age, and participating in banter. They present themselves with a humorous, slightly self‑aware style rather than focusing solely on profit maximization.\n\nThey do not use the chat to coordinate specific contribution strategies or to persuade others to act in a particular way. Unlike some players who explicitly exhort full contributions or call out defectors, this player stays away from moralizing or enforcement. They neither criticize non‑contributors nor defend them; they remain socially positive and non‑confrontational.\n\nResponsiveness to others is high: they pick up on others’ topics (location, age, identity of avatars), respond to playful comments, and reciprocate teasing nicknames. They show clear awareness of who others are (e.g., distinguishing between themselves and similarly named avatars) and engage in small, identity‑based role‑play. This indicates attentiveness and a preference for mutual recognition within the group.\n\nThey occasionally signal alignment with the group’s cooperative mood indirectly, e.g., by affirming that they are “good now” after earlier behavior that might have drawn negative attention. This suggests some sensitivity to reputation and a desire to be seen as part of the cooperative in‑group, though they never explicitly apologize for free‑riding or justify it.\n\nTheir communication style is inclusive rather than domineering: they ask open questions, invite others to share, and participate in collective joking about the researchers and the experimental setup. They show no signs of hostility, trolling, or withdrawal, even when others discuss defectors.\n\nThey do not appear to be focused on rules or technicalities of the game in chat; they leave that to others and treat the interaction more as a casual social experience. Overall, they are a socially engaged, playful participant who values group rapport and positive atmosphere more than strict norm enforcement, and they let their contribution behavior diverge from a purely cooperative self‑presentation without verbal justification."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a verbally pro-cooperation “team player” who nonetheless opportunistically free-rides when it is safe and profitable. They initially match a moderately high cooperative norm and then quickly endorse the group’s push toward full contribution. Their stated intentions track the cooperative equilibrium implied by the multiplier, and they explicitly commit to increasing their contribution alongside others. However, their actual pattern is conditional and self-serving rather than principled: after having experienced full mutual cooperation and seeing that the group can coordinate, they later reduce their own contribution while continuing to present themselves as aligned with the high-contribution plan. This indicates a willingness to exploit trust once a cooperative norm is in place, suggesting a strategic, payoff-sensitive cooperative stance rather than unconditional altruism. They tolerate inequality in their favor and show no attempt to correct it through higher giving or punishment, consistent with an egoistic payoff focus under a cooperative façade. Their risk tolerance appears moderate: they are willing to cooperate early when it is unclear how others will behave, but later they reduce their contribution only after the norm is established, which lowers the risk of coordinated punishment or social backlash.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThey communicate briefly, in a low-key, affiliative tone, aligning themselves with others’ cooperative suggestions. They support simple contribution rules proposed by others and verbally agree with moves toward higher contributions, signaling group-mindedness and willingness to coordinate. They present themselves as compliant and agreeable, affirming others’ plans rather than initiating complex strategies of their own. When another participant suggests aggressive use of punishment against low contributors, they advocate restraint and delay in using the sanctioning mechanism, indicating a preference for maintaining group harmony and avoiding immediate escalation. Their messages are short and responsive, showing attentiveness to others’ proposals but not strong leadership; they adapt to the emerging consensus rather than driving it.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey never make use of the punishment option, even when there is clear deviation from the fully cooperative norm and when they themselves stand to gain relatively from low contribution. Their expressed stance toward punishment is cautious: when another player proposes sanctioning low contributors, they argue for waiting rather than endorsing immediate punishment. This behavior suggests a generally low willingness to engage in costly sanctioning and an aversion to conflict, even when punishment could serve as a deterrent or a fairness-restoring tool. There is no evidence of retaliatory motives, norm-enforcing zeal, or targeted selectivity; instead, they appear to prefer norms to be upheld verbally and by example rather than through formal penalties. Their non-use of punishment even when they themselves under-contribute further suggests they anticipate or hope others will also refrain from punishing, consistent with a strategy that quietly benefits from sanctions remaining dormant.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey show no explicit verbal reaction to others’ payoffs, contribution patterns, or punishment behavior. They receive full information about others’ outcomes but do not comment on fairness, inequality, or the absence of sanctions. Their subsequent behavior, however, is consistent with learning that the group is highly cooperative and that punishment is unused: once they observe repeated high contributions and no one deploying sanctions, they decrease their own contribution while still maintaining friendly communication. This implies that they interpret others’ cooperative actions and non-punishment as an opportunity to relax their own contribution without fear of reprisal. They do not signal concern or guilt about creating advantageous payoff differences, nor do they praise others for cooperating. Overall, their response to outcome information is behavioral rather than verbal: they quietly adjust their strategy to exploit a lenient, trusting environment while preserving a pro-social image in chat."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThe player acts as a verbally strong cooperator but with a late deviation. They initially advocate and follow a high, equal-contribution norm, then privately exploit it once it appears solidified. Early on, they push for a specific positive contribution rule and match it with full contributions, signaling commitment to group welfare and efficiency. When the group successfully coordinates on full contributions, they maintain high giving once but later reduce their own contribution while publicly affirming a high-contribution standard. This pattern fits a “strategic conditional cooperator with opportunistic streak”: they support efficient cooperation while it is being built, then quietly free‑ride once trust and expectations are in place. Their choices suggest they understand that full contribution is collectively efficient and use that norm, but are willing to undercut it when they expect others to keep cooperating. Contribution behavior is somewhat volatile rather than rigid; it responds to the social environment and is not purely selfish or purely altruistic.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThe player communicates briefly, in a directive and upbeat style, and takes early initiative in norm-setting. They propose simple, easily followed rules rather than engaging in detailed calculations, and use short affirmations to maintain consensus. They respond to others’ coordination efforts and show flexibility, agreeing to group adjustments once others suggest more efficient or clearer norms. Their tone is cooperative and encouraging, not confrontational or moralizing. They continue to verbally align with high-cooperation norms even when their later contribution choices diverge from what they say, indicating a preference to maintain a cooperative image and group harmony rather than openly contesting norms. They do not directly challenge others or comment on specific individuals’ choices, and they do not escalate talk around punishment; they let others discuss enforcement without adding to it. Overall, they engage enough to coordinate but avoid deep argument, conflict, or explicit accountability language.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThe player never uses the punishment option, even when opportunities arise to sanction deviations from the stated high-contribution norm (including their own and others’ later lower contributions). They also do not encourage, endorse, or refine others’ suggestions about using punishment as an enforcement tool. This suggests a low propensity to engage in costly punishment, and an avoidance of formal sanctioning roles. Their behavior is consistent with a preference for soft, verbal norm-setting rather than hard enforcement, and with avoiding personal cost to police others. Motives such as deterrence, reciprocity, or retaliation remain unknown; they neither signal a desire to punish defectors nor react to others’ mild norm-enforcement talk. Overall, they appear reluctant to use institutional punishment even when it could protect the cooperative standard they helped establish.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThe player sees others’ contributions and payoffs but does not comment on any differences in earnings or on anyone’s prior undercontribution. They also ignore their own relative payoff advantages when they free‑ride later, at least in public communication. They do not acknowledge the mismatch between stated high-contribution norms and observed lower contributions by themselves or others, and they do not use outcome information to criticize, justify, or negotiate. There is no observable emotional reaction—positive or negative—to others gaining more or less, or to the complete absence of punishment costs and deductions. This suggests they either downplay outcome disparities in their social communication or strategically avoid drawing attention to them, particularly when they benefit from the situation. Their use of outcome feedback seems mainly instrumental and private (to guide their own later deviation) rather than something they openly discuss with the group."

They strongly favor cooperation over individual profit, repeatedly choosing contributions near or at the maximum even when the return from the public fund is lower than the private return. Their giving pattern is generally stable and high rather than erratic. After seeing clear evidence of others free-riding, they slightly lower their contribution once but quickly revert to full cooperation, suggesting that fairness concerns and efficiency motives exist but are overridden by a strong internal norm to contribute. They appear willing to incur substantial personal payoff losses relative to free-riders, indicating low aversion to being exploited and relatively low risk aversion about ending up with a below-average payoff. Their strategy suggests a preference for the socially efficient outcome and internalized cooperation norms over strict payoff maximization.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThe player shows no classic “end-game defection” pattern. Even as the game progresses and horizon effects should encourage self-interest, they do not switch into a low-contribution, last-round exploitation mode. Instead, they maintain or return to very high contributions at the end, despite clear evidence that high giving is not reciprocated by all others. This indicates that their cooperative stance is not contingent on future reciprocity or repeated-interaction incentives; they appear to cooperate as a standing principle rather than as a forward-looking strategic investment. Their awareness of the final round does not substantially erode their willingness to contribute, implying that their behavior is guided more by stable norms or identity (“I am the kind of player who contributes”) than by backward induction or end-game logic.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThe player observes pronounced free-riding by some others and corresponding payoff advantages for those low contributors, yet continues to contribute at a high level. They do make a modest downward adjustment after seeing clear one-sided exploitation, which indicates they notice and care about others’ behavior to some degree, but they stop well short of matching selfish play. Even when others’ higher payoffs make their own relative disadvantage salient, they do not retaliate or attempt to equalize outcomes through strategic withholding. In an environment without punishment or reward tools, they respond more by reaffirming their cooperative norm than by trying to discipline or mirror others’ strategies. Overall, they appear tolerant of inequality and exploitation, prioritizing their own commitment to cooperation over reactive responses to others’ payoffs."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThe player fits a “conditional, profit‑sensitive cooperator” type with substantial within-game variability. They often choose the socially efficient contribution (putting in their full endowment) but also occasionally free‑ride completely or give moderate amounts. Their pattern is not monotonic over time; instead of a steady decline, they oscillate between high and zero contributions. This suggests they pay attention to others’ behavior and their own payoffs and are willing both to support and to exploit the group depending on context.\n\nThey clearly understand the incentives: they repeatedly choose the individually dominant free‑riding option in some rounds and the fully cooperative option in others, which is consistent with deliberate, not random, choice. They are willing to incur substantial personal cost to boost the public fund in many rounds, indicating at least a partial internalization of cooperative norms or a desire for group success, but they do not follow a strict fairness rule (they sometimes take much more than they give relative to others).\n\nTheir conditionality appears asymmetric: they do not systematically “punish” low contributions by consistently dropping to zero afterward, nor do they rigidly match others’ levels; instead they sometimes cooperate strongly even when others are mixed, and sometimes free‑ride even when others are contributing a lot. This suggests a mix of opportunism and periodic recommitment to cooperation rather than a clean reciprocity rule like “match the group average.” Risk tolerance toward “wasted” cooperation is moderate: they are willing to contribute fully even when there is clear evidence of repeated free‑riding by others, but not in every such situation.\n\nOverall, the contribution profile is: often high, sometimes zero, occasionally intermediate, with choices that appear purposeful and payoff-aware rather than random or purely altruistic.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThe player speaks very little and uses a brief, cooperative tone. At the outset they explicitly endorse a proposal for full cooperation. This aligns with a willingness to coordinate and appear prosocial in front of the group. After that, they do not initiate further strategic discussion or challenge others’ behavior. They do not confront low contributors, call out “wolves,” or respond to the mild social commentary in the chat. This indicates a low-engagement, non-confrontational communication style.\n\nThey show no evidence of trying to persuade defectors back into cooperation, and they do not publicly justify their own shifts between high and zero contributions. There is no visible attempt to signal conditionality or to threaten future behavior through words. Instead, they let their actions speak for themselves. Their social style in chat is “quiet supporter”: they initially express agreement with cooperative norms, then withdraw from discussion and focus on play rather than conversation.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThe player shows no classic “end‑game collapse” pattern. In the final segment of the game, they repeatedly choose the fully cooperative contribution, including in the very last decision. This suggests that awareness of the approaching end does not push them toward pure short‑term self-interest. Instead, they either remain aligned with cooperative norms or find it instrumentally appealing to continue contributing even when there are few or no future rounds for reciprocity.\n\nBecause their contributions fluctuate earlier and then stabilize at high levels near the end, they might be using a simple heuristic like “finish strong/cooperative,” or they might be indifferent to the finite horizon implications. There is no visible attempt to “cash out” by defecting in the last round once future retaliation is impossible.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThe player observes detailed feedback about others’ contributions and payoffs and clearly adapts somewhat, but their reactions are mixed. They do not comment on others’ earnings in chat, do not shame low contributors, and do not explicitly praise high contributors. They also do not systematically align their contributions with any one subgroup of players. Instead, they sometimes exploit high-contributing groups by free‑riding and sometimes join them with full cooperation.\n\nTheir alternation between free-riding and contributing suggests they are sensitive to the payoff consequences of others’ behavior: when others are generous, free‑riding is very profitable, and they occasionally take that option; when they value group returns or perhaps reputation or self-image more, they revert to full contributions. However, there is no clear evidence that specific payoff patterns or specific individuals’ outcomes drive these changes; the mapping from observed outcomes to their behavior is noisy. Their response to others’ outcomes can be summarized as “quietly opportunistic but periodically prosocial,” without explicit social enforcement via communication."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a generally high contributor with moderate downward flexibility. Their typical choice is to give a substantial portion of their endowment, often above the group average, but they do not rigidly stick to full cooperation. They alternate between full and partial contributions rather than drifting into persistent free-riding. When group contributions fall, they reduce their own giving somewhat but maintain clearly cooperative levels instead of retaliating to the minimum. When the group appears more cooperative, they respond by sustaining or increasing their own contributions rather than exploiting. They show some concern for personal payoff, as seen in occasional lower contributions, but overall prioritize group efficiency and fairness. Their pattern suggests conditional cooperation with a relatively high personal standard and moderate risk tolerance for being exploited: they are willing to keep giving even when others free-ride, but they do not maximize personal income by systematically under-contributing.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThis player is mostly quiet and observant, engaging minimally in chat. They do not initiate coordination early, nor do they try to organize or enforce group norms during the main part of the game. They show no evidence of confronting specific individuals, persuading them, or joining ongoing joking/teasing dynamics. Their sole explicit statement is a brief self-reflective comment near the end, where they characterize the group (or possibly themselves) as “selfish,” indicating that they are monitoring the social environment and have a moral or evaluative lens on cooperation. The tone of that remark is resigned rather than aggressive; it does not attempt to shame or rally others, just to acknowledge the situation. Overall, they lean toward low-visibility, low-conflict participation: they cooperate behaviorally but do not try to lead, argue, or negotiate.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nAwareness of the finite horizon does not push this player into a clear cooperative collapse. In late rounds, their contributions fluctuate but remain mostly high, including fully cooperative decisions very near the end. They do briefly lower their contribution just before the final round, which increases their own payoff substantially, suggesting some strategic attention to personal earnings as the game concludes. However, they then immediately return to full contribution in the final round even though the game is about to end and others’ behavior offers an opportunity to free-ride. This combination indicates mixed motives: they balance payoff maximization with a persistent cooperative norm, and they are not purely backward-inducting. The self-referential comment about selfishness appears in the final round and coincides with them choosing to contribute fully, which implies that, despite recognizing or anticipating selfish behavior around them (or in themselves earlier), they end the game reaffirming a cooperative identity. Overall, their end-game strategy shows only mild decay and some internal tension between norm-following and self-interest.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThis player is clearly attentive to the broader outcome structure but does not react in a strongly punitive or vengeful way. When others earn more through low contributions, they do not sharply retaliate by dropping to minimal contributions. Instead, they adjust moderately, staying within a cooperative range. They also do not engage in chat to call out specific high-earning free-riders, even when payoff differences are salient. Their later behavior suggests that seeing others benefit from selfishness does not fully erode their willingness to contribute; they sometimes even increase contributions after such patterns. Their one explicit evaluative comment about selfishness indicates they interpret outcome patterns through a fairness lens, but they internalize this mostly as observation rather than as a trigger for active sanctioning. In sum, they are a tolerant, mildly conditional cooperator: sensitive to inequity and exploitation, but reluctant to escalate or withdraw cooperation solely in response to others’ advantageous outcomes."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a generally high contributor who aims for group cooperation but adjusts contributions in response to perceived free-riding. They contribute well above what a purely self-interested player would, often close to or at the maximum, and rarely choose very low amounts. Their pattern shows conditional cooperation: they sustain generous contributions when others also give, and they scale down when they see repeated zero or very low contributions from several players. They do not, however, retaliate fully by dropping to the minimum; even when others appear selfish, they continue to put in a moderate-to-high amount, suggesting a mixture of pro-social preference and self-protection. Their choices are somewhat volatile but within a band of relatively cooperative behavior rather than swinging between extremes of full defection and full cooperation. They appear to hold an informal fairness norm that others “should” contribute something nontrivial, and they register visible frustration when several players give nothing. They tolerate some inequality but show sensitivity when non-contribution seems systematic. Overall, this is a “conditional high cooperator with mild frustration,” not an unconditional altruist and not a strict payoff maximizer.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThe player uses chat sparingly but instrumentally. Early on, they explicitly attempt to coordinate the group toward full cooperation, directly proposing that everyone contribute all of their endowment. This indicates awareness of the social optimum and a willingness to lead coordination efforts. Their tone is concise and informal, including brief corrections of their own typos, which suggests comfort but not heavy investment in social bonding. They engage in light, playful teasing when another player asks who is behaving selfishly, but they do not escalate or moralize harshly. When cooperation deteriorates, they make a short, critical comment about others’ repeated low contributions, indicating that they track patterns and feel entitled to question non-cooperators. They respond to others’ thematic chat (e.g., the “wolf”/predator motif) with brief agreement and participation, but they do not drive the humor. Overall, they engage selectively, mainly to coordinate and to signal disapproval of perceived selfishness, rather than to chat for its own sake.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThis player shows no strong evidence of standard end-game defection. They remain cooperative through the final phase and often increase or maintain high contributions near the end. Their contributions in the last few rounds are among their higher levels, including near-maximum and maximum choices. They do not appear to exploit the finite horizon by cutting contributions when only a few rounds remain; instead, they continue to support the public good as long as others also seem to be contributing substantially. This suggests either limited strategic focus on backward induction or a preference structure where maintaining cooperation and/or fairness is more salient than squeezing out final-round earnings. Horizon awareness is present at the game level (config states they can see rounds remaining), but from behavior alone, there is no clear sign they use that information to strategically reduce cooperation; if anything, they double down on a cooperative or pro-social self-image toward the end.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThe player clearly observes how others are behaving and earning, and they react more to others’ contribution choices than to explicit payoff numbers. When others contribute nothing for multiple periods, they verbally call this out, implicitly criticizing those players’ strategy as selfish. They also engage with a running theme of “wolf” or “selfish” behavior, lightly accusing another player when asked who the selfish one is. However, their behavioral response is measured: they reduce their own contributions when they feel exploited but never to the extreme of full defection for extended stretches. Instead, they seem to seek a balance where they protect themselves from being too exploited while still participating in group gains when others step up. They do not display targeted reciprocity toward specific individuals; because they see all contributions, they react to the overall contribution climate rather than tailoring their behavior to particular players. Emotional tone in response to outcomes is mild irritation rather than strong anger or vindictiveness. Absent punishment or reward tools, they use their own contribution level and occasional critical comments as their main levers to respond to others’ outcomes and strategies."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a moderate, stable contributor who does not move toward full cooperation despite verbally endorsing it. They consistently give a mid-level amount relative to their endowment and maintain that level across rounds, even when others express clear support for maximal contribution. Their behavior suggests they understand that higher group contributions increase everyone’s payoff but choose a personally safe, “middle” level rather than risking full cooperation. They do not condition their contribution strongly on specific others (e.g., the free rider); they neither escalate generosity to inspire them nor cut back in protest. Fairness norms appear present in words (encouraging higher giving) but only weakly implemented in actions, indicating a mild preference for self-insurance over strict equity. Risk tolerance in contribution is moderate: they are willing to contribute nontrivially but avoid the extreme cooperative choice.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThey are socially engaged, friendly, and informal, greeting the group and using humor and self-deprecation. They actively encourage collective cooperation, framing higher contributions as a way for everyone to benefit. They try to coordinate the group toward higher giving and echo others’ cooperative proposals, yet do not personally match the proposed level. They are responsive to emerging topics (e.g., non-contributors, light political joking) and participate in group banter without hostility. Their style shows comfort with group interaction and a desire to belong, using inclusive language and affirming others’ comments. They do not confront specific players aggressively and avoid direct blame, opting instead for general encouragement and agreement with others’ critiques. Overall, they engage rather than withdraw, using conversation to build a cooperative narrative even when their own choices are more cautious than their rhetoric.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThey show awareness that the game has multiple rounds and talk as if planning for future cooperation, but they do not adjust their own contribution upward in the final available opportunity. Their messages imagine continued play and future coordinated contributions even when no further round actually occurs, indicating either inattention to the precise horizon or a default habit of thinking in repeated-game terms. There is no visible “end-game defection spike” in their behavior; instead, they simply maintain their earlier mid-level pattern. This points to weak horizon-driven strategizing: they conceptually support sustained cooperation over time, but their actual decisions do not reflect a distinct end-of-game optimization.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey observe that the group’s contributions are generally high and express approval and enthusiasm about that, treating strong cooperation as socially desirable. They verbally push for even higher group contributions after seeing that cooperation pays off, implying a basic understanding of the payoff structure and group benefits. When it becomes clear that at least one player is persistently free riding, they align socially with those criticizing that behavior but do not escalate into direct hostility; their tone remains more joking and political in flavor than punitive. They do not have access to formal punishment or reward tools in this setting and show no attempt to create informal sanctions beyond light agreement with others’ complaints. Their main adjustment to observed outcomes is rhetorical rather than behavioral: they talk more about everyone contributing fully but keep their own contributions at the same cautious level. This pattern suggests that seeing free riders and payoff differences affects their commentary and group alignment more than it changes their personal strategy."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a moderately strong cooperator who becomes fully cooperative under pro-cooperation norms. They begin with a substantial but not maximal contribution, suggesting a willingness to contribute significantly without immediately adopting the most extreme cooperative strategy. When group messaging later emphasizes full contribution, they escalate to giving their entire endowment, indicating responsiveness to social cues and a conditional cooperative pattern: they are willing to match or exceed what appears to be the emerging norm when others talk about maximizing group benefit. Their behavior is consistent with valuing group welfare over short-term individual payoff, especially once they see that cooperation is common. They do not exhibit opportunistic free-riding even when such a strategy would increase personal payoff, implying relatively low tolerance for exploiting others and a higher tolerance for personal payoff risk in favor of collective gain. Their contributions are stable in the sense that they never move toward defection; instead they move upward in cooperation. Fairness norms are biased toward “everyone should contribute a lot,” and they act accordingly, rather than calibrating to the least cooperative members.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nTheir communication is brief, affiliative, and norm-signaling. They participate minimally in the chat but use their one message to endorse a collective, solidarity-based frame emphasizing shared effort and common benefit. This indicates a preference for cooperation framed as “we’re in this together,” rather than as individual optimization. They do not directly pressure or call out specific low contributors, nor do they join in later blame-oriented messages, suggesting an avoidance of confrontation and a low inclination to police or shame others. They also do not engage in back-and-forth discussions or strategy elaboration, implying a low-verbosity, low-dominance interaction style: they prefer to support a cooperative atmosphere with a simple moral/collective cue and then let actions speak for themselves. Overall, they are socially positive, non-aggressive, and mildly prosocial in tone, but not highly talkative or persuasive.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThis player does not display classic end-game defection. Despite clear knowledge that the game is short and approaching its end, they increase their contribution to the maximum level rather than decreasing it. This suggests that their cooperative motivation is not purely future-oriented or based on expectations of long-term reciprocation. Instead, they appear guided by a principled or norm-based approach (“we should all contribute for the common good”) that is stable even in the final opportunity to free-ride. They seem attentive to the temporal horizon (since it is made explicit), but they do not exploit it; if anything, the later stage plus stronger cooperative messaging amplifies their willingness to fully cooperate. This pattern is consistent with a type that prioritizes maintaining or affirming a cooperative identity over strategically exploiting the final round. Learning across rounds appears in the form of increased alignment with strong-cooperation talk rather than a payoff-maximizing response to observed free-riding.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThe player observes that some others contribute very little or nothing and thereby earn higher payoffs, but there is no evidence of them reacting with punitive language, criticism, or visible resentment. They neither join the group’s later negative commentary about a persistent free-rider nor attempt to socially sanction that individual. At the same time, they also do not shift toward lower contributions in response to observing these unequal outcomes, indicating that their cooperative stance is robust against such exploitation. They appear to accept asymmetric payoffs without retaliating or withdrawing cooperation, which implies a relatively high tolerance for inequality when it arises from others’ free-riding. From observable behavior, they seem more anchored to their own prosocial standard and to broad cooperative norms than to strict reciprocity or payoff comparison. Emotional state and detailed beliefs about fairness are unknown beyond this—there is no direct expression of satisfaction or frustration regarding others’ gains or losses—so inferences about their internal reactions remain low confidence."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a perfectly stable, moderate contributor. They always contribute exactly half of their endowment and never adjust this level despite substantial variation in others’ behavior, total contributions, and final payoffs. Their strategy is simple and rule-like: “I put in a fair, middle amount every time,” with no detectable experimentation or trend over the game. They do not try to match the group’s average, do not escalate to full cooperation when others are highly cooperative, and do not drop toward free-riding when others’ contributions fall. This indicates a strong internal fairness norm anchored at “half,” combined with low reactivity to social or payoff signals. They appear risk-averse with respect to strategy change: once they find a behavior that yields solid payoffs, they stick to it, even though higher contributions would raise group and personal returns given the multiplier. They prioritize steadiness and simplicity over payoff maximization and do not appear to condition their contributions on any specific peer’s behavior.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThis player never uses punishment, despite repeated opportunities and clear variation in others’ contribution levels, including occasional low contributions by peers and visible use of punishment by others. Their inaction persists regardless of whether some players contribute less than the group norm or whether punishment might have been effective at disciplining a specific target. This suggests a strong reluctance to incur personal costs to harm others, even for potential norm enforcement. They do not appear motivated by retaliation, do not mimic others’ punitive strategies, and do not engage in second-order punishment (punishing non-punishers). The pattern is consistent with a non-punitive, harm-averse type that prefers to let the contribution structure “speak for itself” rather than enforcing norms through costly sanctions. Whether this is due to moral discomfort with harming others, skepticism about the effectiveness of punishment, or simple self-interest in avoiding costs remains unknown.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nThis player is never punished during the game, so their direct behavioral response to identifiable punishers is unknown. There is no evidence of pre-emptive adaptation to avoid punishment; their contribution level is unchanging from the start and does not react to others’ sanctioning patterns. Given their stable, moderate contributions and non-punitive stance, if they were punished in a future setting, one might expect low propensity for counter-punishment and a tendency to maintain their own norm-following behavior; however, this is speculative and confidence in this extrapolation is low.\n\n<REWARD>\nThis player never uses rewards, even when others contribute more than they do and when prosocial reward behavior is clearly present in the group. They do not invest to encourage high contributors, nor do they attempt to strategically reinforce allies or cultivate reciprocity. Their stance appears efficiency- and cost-focused at the individual level: they avoid spending coins on mechanisms that transfer payoff away from themselves, even when such transfers could plausibly improve future cooperation. They also show no sign of imitating others’ rewarding behavior. The absence of rewards, combined with steady moderate contributions, fits a “self-contained cooperator” profile: willing to contribute reliably to the public good but not willing to pay extra to manage others’ behavior through positive incentives.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThis player is never rewarded, so their direct reactions to identifiable rewarders are unknown. They do not adjust their contributions in response to the general presence of rewards in the environment; their behavior remains unchanged while others use rewards multiple times. There is no observable attempt to signal for future rewards by increasing contributions, nor any sign of forming implicit alliances with known rewarders. Whether they would reciprocate rewards via higher contributions or via counter-reward in another setting is unknown.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThis player observes substantial information each round: others’ contributions, payoffs, and costs spent on punishment and reward. Yet they display no behavioral adjustment in response. They do not increase contributions when others contribute very high amounts and group payoffs rise, and they do not decrease when others free-ride more or when punitive conflict escalates among others. They ignore both negative and positive incentive signals directed at other players and do not seem to take advantage of apparent “safe” opportunities to free-ride when cooperation stays high. This indicates low sensitivity to social comparison and low engagement with the strategic social dynamics. Their primary focus appears to be on maintaining a personally acceptable, predictable payoff stream rather than tailoring their behavior in response to others’ gains, losses, or enforcement activity. Overall, they behave as a stable, internally guided cooperator who treats others’ outcomes as background information rather than as cues for adaptation."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a rigid, unconditional medium contributor. They always give the same moderate amount, well below the emerging group norm but far above the minimum. Their contributions do not react to punishment, to changes in others’ contributions, or to shifts in group efficiency. This indicates a pre‑set personal rule (“this is my fair share”) rather than strategic conditional cooperation. They appear unconcerned with aligning to the majority’s higher standard, yet also unwilling to exploit the group by free‑riding fully. They tolerate being a mild under‑contributor despite repeated signals (via punishment and group behavior) that the group favors higher cooperation. They seem risk‑averse to extremes: they avoid both very low and very high contributions, sticking to a stable middle regardless of social or strategic feedback. Whether they consciously calculate payoffs is unknown; however, their lack of adjustment despite clear evidence that higher contributions are typical suggests low responsiveness to payoff optimization and social conformity.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThis player never spends on punishment, despite: (a) consistently contributing less than most others, (b) being punished themselves on multiple occasions, and (c) witnessing substantial punishment activity in the group. They do not punish low contributors when such targets appear, nor do they retaliate after being punished. This indicates a strong aversion to costly punishment in any form. Their motive appears neither norm-enforcing nor revenge‑oriented. They implicitly free‑ride on others’ willingness to punish norm violators: they benefit from enforcement without contributing to its cost. The absence of retaliation, even when they are singled out among otherwise high contributors, suggests low aggression and a relatively thick skin toward social sanctions. Whether they view punishment as unjust or simply not worth the cost is unknown; what is clear is that they adopt a “no punishment, ever” stance.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThis player shows striking insensitivity to social and payoff feedback. Their own contribution and punishment decisions remain unchanged despite: being punished, observing that other players routinely contribute more, seeing some players repeatedly targeted for severe deductions, and noticing that contribution levels and earnings fluctuate over time. They do not react by increasing contributions to avoid further punishment, by decreasing contributions in frustration, or by joining in sanctioning detected low contributors. This pattern suggests a detached or self‑contained style: they follow an internal rule and largely ignore outside signals. They appear tolerant of earning slightly less than they could in a fully aligned, high‑contribution role, and tolerant of being punished without attempting to correct others or defend themselves. Their implicit belief seems to be that individual behavior is their own business; they neither try to shape others’ outcomes nor allow others’ choices to reshape theirs. Whether they consciously infer group norms or future consequences is unknown, but behaviorally they function as a “fixed‑rule moderate contributor who abstains from enforcement,” maintaining their course regardless of the social or payoff environment."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a mostly high, rule-like contributor with a brief, exploratory phase of free-riding. Across the game, they almost always give the full endowment, with only a small minority of rounds in which they keep everything. Their default is to cooperate, and they quickly return to that default after testing the alternative.\n\nThey appear to use a simple conditional heuristic: when others contribute at or near full levels and group efficiency is strong, they continue to contribute fully without hesitation. When average contributions drop and free-riding becomes more visible, they briefly try defecting themselves but do not convert this into a persistent low-contribution strategy. This suggests they value the cooperative norm and are willing to bear costs for it even in the presence of some free-riding.\n\nTheir fairness norm seems moderately strict: they continue to contribute fully even when several others are clearly contributing nothing. They do not systematically match the lowest contributors; instead, they seem anchored on “full contribution” as their reference behavior, occasionally deviating but not stabilizing on low effort. This pattern is consistent with a “conditional cooperator with a high cooperation baseline” rather than a strict reciprocity type that closely tracks the detailed pattern of others’ contributions.\n\nRisk tolerance with respect to cooperation is relatively high. They keep contributing in the face of uncertainty about punishment patterns and others’ future behavior, and they do so even after they themselves are targeted by punishment while cooperating. They do not react by withdrawing from the public good; instead, they revert to or maintain high cooperation, indicating that they are willing to risk being exploited or misunderstood rather than abandon the cooperative strategy.\n\nOverall, their type is: “principled high contributor with mild, short-lived experimentation in free-riding, anchored in a cooperative norm rather than finely tuned payoff-maximization.”\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nAwareness of the horizon does not trigger a decay in their cooperation. In the final segment of the game, including the very last round, they maintain full contributions rather than shifting into an end-game defection pattern. There is no evidence of a deliberate final-round “grab” of private payoff.\n\nTheir end-game behavior is consistent with time-stable preferences for contributing: they treat late rounds much like earlier ones when group cooperation looks decent, continuing to provide full contributions even when some others do not. When cooperation surges toward the very end, they align fully with that high-cooperation state and stay there.\n\nThis suggests that, for this player, the knowledge of remaining rounds (finite horizon) does not override their cooperative heuristic. They do not appear to run backward induction logic or, if they do, they do not allow it to dictate a shift toward defection. Their strategy is more rule-based (“I contribute”) than dynamically re-optimized as the game approaches termination.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThe player never uses the punishment option at any point, despite being repeatedly exposed to clear, low-contribution free-riders and experiencing times when their own cooperative behavior coincides with low group contributions. They also receive punishment themselves, both while cooperating and while free-riding, yet they never retaliate. This indicates a strong reluctance to engage in costly sanctioning, independent of whether they are a victim or observer of norm violations.\n\nTheir non-use of punishment holds even when punishing would be individually cheap relative to the scale of free-riding and could, in principle, help stabilize cooperation. This suggests that they either (a) place intrinsic disutility on harming others, even free-riders; (b) are skeptical that anonymous punishment will be effective or correctly interpreted; or (c) prioritize their own earnings and see punishment as an unattractive cost. From behavior alone, the exact motive is unknown; what is clear is that they consistently choose not to punish.\n\nThey also do not engage in “moralistic retaliation” after being punished themselves. Being targeted does not trigger sanctioning of others, even when low contributors are easy to identify. This supports the view that they are non-punitive by disposition in this environment, rather than simply waiting for a personal grievance to justify punishment.\n\nIn sum, they are a non-punishing, cooperation-focused type: they support the public good mainly through their own contributions rather than through enforcing norms via costly sanctions."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a generally high contributor who quickly aligns with the cooperative majority once the group pattern is clear. They begin with an intermediate contribution, then briefly test a strong free‑riding move, and subsequently commit to near‑maximal giving for the rest of the game. Their contributions track the apparent cooperative norm rather than the marginal per‑coin return, indicating that fairness and group alignment matter more than strict payoff maximization. The one low‑contribution deviation suggests they occasionally probe whether their own contribution level matters for either payoffs or social sanctions, but they do not persist in exploiting others even when they could. They tolerate being below the group average once without reacting via punishment or reward, implying relatively low sensitivity to short‑run disadvantage and a higher focus on stable cooperation. Risk tolerance appears moderate: they are willing to contribute fully even in the presence of a chronic low contributor and intense punishment dynamics, relying on the group’s overall cooperative structure rather than hedging against exploitation. Conditionality is present but coarse: they condition on the overall pattern (group seems cooperative → they stay highly cooperative), rather than finely adjusting to the exact mix of low and high contributors.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nAwareness of the finite horizon does not induce end‑game defection. The player maintains high contributions through the final round, even as at least one other group member sharply reduces contributions. They do not appear to switch strategy or to “cash out” cooperation near the end, suggesting either a preference for stable norms over last‑round exploitation or a belief that consistency is more important than small last‑round gains. There is no visible escalation or reduction in use of punishment or reward at the end because they never use these tools at any point, so no end‑game shift in sanctioning occurs. Overall, their strategy is horizon‑insensitive: they behave similarly in early, middle, and final phases once they have settled into their cooperative pattern.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThe player never uses punishment, despite having multiple targets that could be justified by standard fairness norms (e.g., a persistent near‑zero contributor, occasional under‑contributors, and those who later cut back sharply). They refrain from punishing even when others’ punishment imposes substantial costs on them, and even when punishment could plausibly serve as deterrence. This consistent non‑use suggests a punishment‑averse or non‑confrontational type. Possible motives include a dislike of harming others, skepticism about the effectiveness or efficiency of punishment, or a desire to avoid escalation in an already punishment‑heavy environment. The group exhibits intensive punishment activity among others, yet this does not induce them to join in or “share the burden” of norm enforcement. Their stance is closer to a cooperative pacifist than to a conditional cooperator with altruistic punishment. Whether they would punish in more extreme defection scenarios is unknown; given current data, their threshold for punishing appears very high or practically unattainable.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nThe player is punished multiple times by others but never retaliates and never adjusts punishment behavior in response. They do not start punishing specific individuals who targeted them, nor do they reduce their contributions in a way that looks like revenge or defiance. After being punished following a low contribution, they actually move toward higher and more stable cooperation, which is consistent with tolerance or at least non‑retaliation rather than spite. Whether they interpret punishment as a signal to conform, as noise, or as unjust but not worth responding to is unknown; however, there is no behavioral evidence of either counter‑punishment or targeted retribution. They also do not appear to selectively punish any of the frequent punishers, despite clearly being able to identify them. Overall, they respond to being punished with behavioral stability and continued cooperation, not with aggression, avoidance, or norm‑breaking.\n\n<REWARD>\nThe player never uses the reward option, even toward strong, consistent cooperators who might be natural reward targets. Given that reward is relatively inefficient mechanically, this may indicate that they pay attention to institutional efficiency and see reward as a poor use of resources compared with simply contributing. It may also reflect a general reluctance to intervene in others’ payoffs at all, whether positively or negatively, preferring to express prosociality solely through their own contribution level. Their absence from both punishment and reward channels suggests a strategy of “quiet cooperation” rather than active norm management. Whether they would reward in an environment where reward is more efficient than contributions or punishment is unknown.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThey are occasionally rewarded by others but show no change in contribution, punishment, or reward behavior afterward. There is no evidence of reciprocating reward, forming alliances via mutual rewarding, or favoring particular partners in any systematic way. Their cooperative pattern is already high and remains so regardless of who rewards them, suggesting that gratitude does not translate into observable sanction behavior within this game. This could reflect a belief that the best “thanks” is continued cooperation rather than targeted reward, or simply indifference to reward mechanisms. Any tendency toward direct reciprocity via reward is unknown but likely weak in this institutional setup.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThe player is exposed to extreme punishment usage by others and to a persistent low contributor who absorbs heavy sanctions over time. Despite seeing these outcomes, they do not join the punitive majority, nor do they adjust their contributions downward in protest or upward as explicit alignment with punishers; instead, they settle into stable high cooperation. This indicates that their behavior is only weakly contingent on the precise distribution of payoffs, sanctions, and deductions among others. They appear neither intimidated into cooperation by harsh punishment of defectors nor motivated to participate in the sanctioning process. They also do not exploit the situation by free‑riding on others’ enforcement efforts. Overall, they seem to monitor group outcomes enough to recognize the dominant cooperative norm and to recognize that they themselves are sometimes targeted, but they choose a strategy of consistent cooperation and non‑intervention regardless of who is being punished or rewarded. Their beliefs about the fairness or legitimacy of others’ punishment patterns are unknown; behaviorally, they remain a cooperative, sanction‑neutral participant in a highly interventionist group."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a predominantly high contributor who treats near-full cooperation as their default. They repeatedly give the maximum feasible amount, deviating only once with a low contribution immediately after being personally punished. That deviation appears reactive rather than part of a longer-term defection strategy, because they promptly revert to full contributions afterward despite continued heterogeneity in others’ behavior. They tolerate coexisting with at least one persistent free rider and a mild under-contributor without adjusting their own contribution downward in a sustained way, suggesting either strong pro-social or norm-following preferences, or a focus on group efficiency over personal payoff optimization. Their willingness to contribute fully alongside a known defector indicates low aversion to being “taken advantage of,” or at least a higher weight on maintaining cooperation than on strict payoff-maximizing fairness. Contribution levels are highly stable over time except for the single retaliatory-looking dip, suggesting low volatility and some robustness to noise and punishment. Risk tolerance appears moderate: they are willing to risk being exploited by free riders, but they also show they can reduce contributions when directly targeted, implying they are not blindly altruistic.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThe player shows no meaningful end-game decay in cooperation. They continue to contribute fully through the final rounds, including the very last round, despite the absence of future interaction. This suggests that their cooperative behavior is not primarily driven by fear of future punishment or by future-oriented reciprocity, but more by a stable internal norm or preference. They do not change their use of punishment or reward mechanisms in the final stages (they remain inactive after the early game), implying little strategic horizon-based shift in sanctioning behavior as the game ends. If they are aware of the horizon, they do not visibly exploit it to defect or to exploit others’ continued cooperation. This is consistent with a type that either values cooperation intrinsically or focuses on simple, stable heuristics rather than dynamic end-game strategizing.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThe player uses punishment very sparingly and highly selectively. They punish only once, and that punishment targets the extreme free rider, which aligns with a norm-enforcement or fairness motive rather than competitive or spiteful motives. They never punish moderate under-contributors or anyone who appears cooperative overall, even when those players deviate slightly from the informal “full-contribution” norm later. They also never join the large-scale sanctioning coalitions that other players form in later rounds. This restraint suggests they are reluctant to spend on punishment despite its high effectiveness, perhaps due to efficiency concerns, aversion to hostility, or uncertainty about the social value of escalating sanctions. Their single punishment occurs when the target has visibly benefitted from the group’s high contributions while contributing nothing, indicating sensitivity to very salient free riding. The fact that they do not punish again even after being punished by someone else suggests they do not use punishment as retaliation. On balance, they appear as a “minimal but targeted norm enforcer” who intervenes only when a defector’s behavior is stark and early, and then prefers to let others or the group dynamics handle enforcement thereafter.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nThe player is punished once after lowering their contribution. In response, they do not retaliate against the punisher, nor do they adopt a sustained defection strategy. Instead, they return quickly to full cooperation and cease all use of the punishment mechanism. This pattern is consistent with either (a) interpreting punishment as a signal that high contributions are expected and complying with that signal, or (b) independently choosing to revert to their prior cooperative norm regardless of the punishment. There is no evidence of counter-punishment, grudges, or targeted hostility toward any specific punisher, even though punishers are identifiable. The player’s behavior fits a forgiving or at least non-vengeful style: they absorb the punishment, adjust their contribution upward, and do not escalate the conflict. Whether they consciously attribute the punishment to their own low contribution versus other factors is unknown, but their subsequent behavior is compatible with accepting the feedback rather than resisting it.\n\n<REWARD>\nThe player never uses the reward option at any point, despite having multiple opportunities and being surrounded by several consistently high contributors. This consistent non-use can reflect several possible motives: they may view the reward technology as inefficient (costly relative to its impact), unnecessary given already high cooperation, or strategically unimportant compared to maintaining their own contributions. It could also signal a preference to avoid positive discrimination among cooperators, treating high contributions as a baseline expectation rather than something that merits extra reinforcement. Since they also refrain from punishing most of the time, their overall pattern suggests a “low-intervention” approach to social control mechanisms: they are willing to set an example via their own contributions but do not invest extra resources to shape others’ behavior through formal incentives.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThe player is never rewarded by anyone, so their direct reaction to positive incentives remains unknown. There is no evidence about whether they would reciprocate rewards, increase cooperation further, form alliances, or shift their sanctioning decisions in favor of rewarders. Given their stable high contributions even without receiving rewards, it is plausible (though not demonstrable) that rewards would not dramatically change their cooperative baseline, but any specific reciprocity tendencies toward identifiable rewarders remain unknown.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThe player has full visibility of others’ contributions, payoffs, and sanctioning behavior, yet responds in a highly restrained and stable manner. They clearly distinguish between extreme and moderate deviations: they react once to a clear free rider with punishment, but they ignore lesser under-contribution and do not adjust contributions downward to “match” others. They also do not join the heavy sanctioning waves that others deploy against repeat low contributors later, suggesting either disapproval of excessive punishment, a desire to avoid further costs, or a belief that additional sanctions are redundant once a social signal is established. They do not mirror others’ aggressive styles or apparent vendettas; instead they maintain cooperative contributions even while observing large punishment costs and severe deductions inflicted on others. This indicates that their behavior is not heavily swayed by observing chaos or conflict—cooperation is robust to others’ punishment battles. They also show no visible attempt to exploit information about who is being heavily sanctioned (e.g., by reducing contributions alongside them), reinforcing the interpretation that their primary adjustment to others’ outcomes is limited and focused: a single early attempt to discipline the most blatant free rider, followed by a return to quiet, example-based cooperation."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a moderately prosocial, steady contributor with mild upward flexibility. They typically contribute around half of their endowment, holding this level quite consistently over time. They sometimes increase contributions above their baseline, including occasionally contributing very high amounts, but they never drop to very low or zero. Their behavior suggests a stable internal norm of “contribute a fair, mid-level amount” rather than strictly matching others or free-riding.\n\nThey do not display clear conditional cooperation in the sense of sharply adjusting to others’ average contributions; despite substantial variation in peers’ behavior and heavy use of punishment in the group, their own contributions remain in a relatively narrow band centered on a medium level. When they deviate, it is more often upward than downward, which points to a willingness to shoulder extra cost for group benefit, at least occasionally. They do not appear strongly risk-averse about being exploited; they continue to contribute at moderate or higher levels even when some low contributors persist and when norm-enforcing punishment by others is clearly active.\n\nOverall, this player behaves like a “quiet, norm-abiding cooperator”: they are not a maximal altruist, but they are reliably cooperative, refrain from exploiting others’ generosity, and are willing to increase their share slightly when the cooperative climate supports it.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nAwareness of the finite horizon does not lead this player to unravel their cooperation. In the final phase, they maintain or even raise contributions relative to their usual baseline, including in the very last decision. They do not attempt an end-game defection or payoff grab, despite clear evidence that others are willing and able to punish deviations from group norms.\n\nThis pattern suggests that their contribution rule is not driven by backward induction or short-term payoff maximization. Instead, they appear to treat “how much is fair” as relatively time-invariant, continuing to apply their internal norm to the end. If anything, the late-game pattern hints at a mild inclination to leave on a “cooperative note” rather than to exploit the final opportunity, although confidence in that interpretation is low.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThis player never uses punishment, despite being embedded in a group where punishment is frequent, targeted, and sometimes severe. They refrain from punishing both clear under-contributors and clear over-users of the punishment mechanism. Their zero use of punishment persists throughout the interaction, regardless of how egregious others’ behavior might appear.\n\nThis can indicate several non-mutually-exclusive motives:\n- A strong preference to avoid costly conflict and interpersonal aggression.\n- A belief that others are already enforcing norms sufficiently, making their own punishment unnecessary.\n- A payoff-oriented aversion to spending coins on an action with no direct monetary return.\n- A general reluctance to take on the role of enforcer or to single others out.\n\nGiven their consistent cooperation, their non-punishment does not look like cynical free-riding on others’ enforcement; instead it resembles a “principled non-punisher” or “conflict-averse cooperator” profile: willing to do their part via contributions, but unwilling to harm others even when it might support norm compliance.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nThis player is never punished. Consequently, there is no direct evidence on how they respond to being sanctioned or to identifiable punishers. Their fairness norm and medium-to-high contributions would give little reason for others to target them, and indeed the group does not do so.\n\nTheir hypothetical response to punishment (e.g., whether they would retaliate, comply, or disengage) is unknown. There is no data on whether they adjust contributions in anticipation of possible punishment either; their stable pattern suggests they are not strongly driven by fear of sanctions, but that remains an inference with low confidence.\n\n<REWARD>\nThis player never uses the reward mechanism, even though several others in the group repeatedly spend on both rewards and punishments. They choose not to reward high contributors or apparent cooperators, nor do they use rewards to build alliances or to signal approval.\n\nGiven the reward technology here is payoff-neutral (cost equals benefit), their non-use might reflect:\n- A simple preference to keep decisions minimal and not engage with the secondary mechanism.\n- Low interest in explicit social signaling via monetary gifts, even toward cooperators.\n- A belief that contributions themselves are sufficient signals of prosociality, making extra rewarding unnecessary.\n- A weak strategic interest in shaping others’ behavior via positive reinforcement.\n\nBecause they nonetheless contribute reliably and sometimes generously, their lack of rewarding does not indicate selfishness, but rather a non-interventionist style: they cooperate quietly on the primary task and refrain from “meta” interventions in others’ payoffs.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThis player is never rewarded. Therefore, there is no evidence about how they respond when someone grants them a reward, nor about reciprocity or alliance-building toward identified rewarders. Whether they would increase contributions, reciprocate, or ignore such gestures is unknown.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThis player observes a rich environment of strong norm enforcement and selective generosity around them: some participants consistently punish low contributors, some repeatedly punish specific targets, and others frequently reward particular peers. High and low payoffs, severe deductions, and sizable reward expenditures are all visible. Despite this, the player’s own behavior remains strikingly stable: medium-to-high contributions, no punishment, no reward.\n\nThe most plausible interpretation is that they mainly track the broad cooperative climate rather than micromanaging reactions to each person’s outcome. They neither join punitive coalitions against frequent low contributors nor respond to perceived overuse of punishment or reward with countermeasures. They appear largely indifferent, behaviorally, to the detailed pattern of who gains and who loses from the sanctioning system, beyond whatever aggregate effect it has on overall contributions.\n\nIn new PGG environments, this “quiet cooperator, non-enforcer” type is likely to:\n- Maintain a medium contribution level anchored in an internal fairness norm.\n- Be relatively insensitive to complex sanctioning dynamics, as long as they are not personally targeted.\n- Avoid both punishment and reward, even when norm enforcement or gratitude signaling might be beneficial.\n- Remain cooperative through the end of the interaction without exploiting the final rounds."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a stable, moderate cooperator with a simple, largely unconditional rule. They almost always contribute a fixed, mid-range amount that does not track small changes in others’ behavior. They occasionally deviate upward once but otherwise keep using the same level, even when surrounded by many high contributors and persistent low contributors. They do not appear to chase precise fairness by matching others’ contributions or punishing free-riding through their own contribution level. They seem comfortable earning good payoffs while letting others shoulder extra cooperative cost, suggesting a pragmatic, mildly self-interested fairness norm: they are willing to contribute a reasonable share, but not to match the group’s top cooperators. Risk tolerance around contribution is low; they avoid extreme under- or over-contribution and stick to a safe, predictable pattern.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThey show no discernible end-game shift. Contribution behavior at the start, middle, and final rounds looks effectively the same, including in the very last round when some others sharply change their contributions. They do not appear to exploit the finite horizon by reducing cooperation near the end, nor do they escalate to higher contributions to “go out on a cooperative note.” This suggests either (a) they are not actively using backward-induction style reasoning, or (b) they adopt a “set-and-forget” heuristic and do not see strategic value in changing it as the game nears completion.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey never use punishment, despite persistent and visible low contributors, and despite punishment being comparatively efficient in impact per coin. They refrain both when low contributors are lightly treated and when they are heavily targeted by others. This consistent inaction indicates a strong reluctance to spend resources harming others, even for potential deterrence. They likely view punishment as not worth the cost or as socially undesirable, and they do not engage in second-order punishment (punishing those who punish, or punishing those who fail to cooperate with punishments). There is no evidence of retaliatory punishment in response to being punished. Overall, they act as a non-punishing, tolerant type, letting others bear all enforcement costs.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nThey are punished at least once and do not respond with any visible change: they neither adjust their contributions in the punisher’s direction nor retaliate with punishment. Their contribution level remains at its usual setting immediately afterward, and they continue not to use the punishment tool at all. This suggests they either discount punishment as noise, do not infer clear information from it, or simply prioritize their own simple rule over reacting to sanctions. There is no behavioral sign of spite or grudges and no sign of “compliance” to punishment demands; they are behaviorally inert with respect to punishers.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey never reward anyone, including very high contributors or individuals who consistently spend to reward others. They pass up many opportunities to cheaply send positive signals or reinforce cooperation. Given that rewards are cost-neutral at the social level (cost equals grant), their refusal suggests either a strong cost-minimizing motive (saving every coin for themselves) or indifference to relational/reciprocal signaling. They do not use rewards strategically to build alliances, thank high contributors, or counterbalance punishment in the group. Their stance is a strictly non-rewarding one: they free-ride on others’ use of rewards just as they free-ride on others’ punishment efforts.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThey receive no rewards, so direct evidence of reciprocity toward rewarders is unavailable. Since they never reward anyone in any context, even when multiple others repeatedly reward different peers, the best inference is that they do not condition their reward decisions on having been rewarded. If they were to be rewarded, their existing pattern suggests low likelihood of reciprocating in kind; they appear focused on their own payoff rule rather than relational exchange. Confidence on counterfactual reciprocity is low, but all observable behavior points toward non-reciprocating in terms of rewards.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey observe frequent, often intense punishment of low contributors and repeated reward flows from a subset of generous players to selected peers. They never adjust their own contribution, punishment, or reward decisions in apparent response. They maintain their contribution rule and zero use of the sanctioning tools, regardless of who gains or loses from punishment and reward. This indicates low behavioral sensitivity to others’ payoffs, enforcement actions, or changing fortunes. They do not join majority norms against persistent low contributors, nor do they move closer to the more cooperative “core” despite that core being repeatedly reinforced by others. Their stance is best characterized as observational but detached: they let others coordinate norms and bear enforcement costs while they keep a personally satisfactory, moderate-cooperation, no-enforcement strategy."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a generally high, prosocial contributor who occasionally shades contributions downward in response to context and incentives. They routinely give well above the group average and often at or near the maximum, suggesting a strong cooperative norm and low aversion to paying personal cost for group benefit. Their behavior is not rigid: they sometimes lower their contribution by a few coins when free-riding or anti-social punishment around them makes full cooperation look less rewarding or less respected, but they do not pivot to low contributions or clear defection. They do not appear to condition contributions finely on specific others’ exact amounts; instead they track broad patterns (some persistent under-contributors, many medium‑to‑high contributors) and maintain a generally cooperative stance. Fairness seems important: their own contributions remain high even when others contribute less, but they use punishments rather than reduced contributions as their main fairness-enforcement tool. Risk tolerance for exploitation is moderate: they accept being more generous than many others, but occasionally trim their amount, especially when they have been targeted despite contributing highly.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nAwareness of the finite horizon does not lead them to a typical end‑game collapse of cooperation. They continue to contribute at or near the maximum in the final stages, including the very last round, even when some others clearly slack off. Instead of cashing out, they use the last round to enforce a salient fairness norm when someone contributes nothing, accepting a direct payoff loss to express that norm. Across the last several rounds, they slightly vary contributions but do not show a monotonic downward trend, indicating that future‑oriented strategic thinking (“no point cooperating now”) is weaker than their preference for consistent cooperative identity and norm enforcement. They seem to treat the end of the game as an occasion to confirm standards rather than abandon them.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThis player is willing to incur meaningful costs to punish what they interpret as unfairly low contributions, especially when someone contributes dramatically below the group. They target clear under‑contributors selectively rather than punishing broadly or symmetrically. Their punishment profile fits “altruistic norm enforcer”: they are prepared to lose coins to impose sizeable deductions on perceived free‑riders, and they do so even when many others are already punishing the same targets, meaning they are not just filling gaps but adding to a collective sanction. They almost never punish medium or high contributors and do not use punishment instrumentally to compete with peers or to retaliate against those who outperform them. They largely avoid punishing moderate deviations and reserve it for conspicuous offenders or for striking end‑game norm violations (such as a zero contribution when most others still contribute). Their pattern suggests a deterrence or expressive motive—making clear that low cooperation is unacceptable—even when short‑run monetary returns from punishing are negative. They do not appear to escalate punishments in response to being targeted themselves; their targets are driven by others’ contributions, not by who punished them earlier.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nWhen others punish them, they do not change their behavior in vindictive or appeasing ways. After being targeted despite contributing highly, they continue to contribute generously and do not respond with counter‑punishment toward those who previously punished them, even though identities are visible. This indicates either indifference to anti‑social punishment or a deliberate refusal to engage in punishment wars. They do not noticeably reduce their cooperation to avoid being punished, nor do they attempt to buy goodwill by rewarding or by relaxing their own punishment toward harsh punishers. Their stance toward punishers is thus best described as non‑retaliatory and norm‑consistent: they keep cooperating and keep punishing low contributors according to their own standards, rather than adapting to others’ punitive behavior.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey almost never use the reward option, despite frequently observing high contributions and others’ active rewarding. This suggests they either see little instrumental value in costly reward, or they judge the technology as too weak compared to punishment, or both. Their cooperative norm is expressed mainly through their own high contributions and through punishing defectors, not through actively subsidizing cooperators. The absence of rewarding even for repeated high contributors implies that gratitude signaling or alliance‑building via rewards is not central to their strategy. They rely on contributions and sanctions rather than positive reinforcement to shape group behavior.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nWhen they receive rewards, their behavior shows no distinct reciprocity toward the specific rewarders: contribution levels remain driven by their own cooperative standard and the broader environment, and they do not start rewarding or preferentially punishing/forbearing in response to who rewarded them. Nor do they appear to “join” a reward coalition, despite seeing some players repeatedly use rewards. This implies that rewards do not strongly alter their beliefs about others or their own tactical choices; they accept them passively but do not treat them as the basis for alliances or special treatment. Any internal feeling of gratitude is not expressed through measurable behavioral changes.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey track others’ contribution and sanction profiles closely enough to differentiate chronic low contributors, steady cooperators, and those who occasionally defect sharply. Their punishment choices show sensitivity to large payoff imbalances caused by free‑riding: when low contributors still earn well, they are more likely to punish them strongly, indicating a concern with both contribution fairness and resulting payoffs. They do not emulate players who spend heavily on punishments or rewards; instead they maintain a comparatively moderate use of sanctions and almost no use of rewards, even when others engage in extreme sanctioning that drives some payoffs sharply negative. They seem unimpressed by anti‑social punishment and do not copy it. High payoffs earned through cooperative contributions do not trigger envy or competitive punishment from them; they tolerate others doing better than themselves as long as contributions look fair. Overall, they interpret outcome tables primarily through the lens of contribution norms and exploitative gains, using that information to guide selective punishment while keeping their own contribution strategy largely stable and prosocial."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a generally high contributor with occasional, deliberate deviations. They usually give the full endowment, sustaining high contributions across the game, including early and late stages. The few reduced contributions are not random drift: they appear when the player is actively experimenting with incentive use (punishing or rewarding) or perhaps testing how much they can free-ride once the public-good level looks secure. They do not condition contributions tightly on others’ exact amounts; they continue to contribute fully even when some group members chronically give less. This suggests a norm-driven or outcome-focused cooperative stance rather than a strict “matched contribution” strategy. They seem willing to sacrifice their own payoff to maintain a high public good, showing relatively low risk aversion regarding being exploited and a higher priority on group efficiency or personal cooperative identity.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nAwareness of the finite horizon does not lead them to unravel cooperation. Contributions remain high at the end, with no evidence of deliberate end-game defection. In the final stage, they instead shift effort into costly positive reinforcement, increasing reward spending even though there is no future round in which to benefit from changed behavior. This pattern suggests they do not rely on backward induction; they either discount the theoretical prediction of end-game collapse or prioritize expressing prosocial or approval norms over strict payoff maximization. Any end-game adjustment is toward “parting gifts” and norm-signaling, not toward self-interested withdrawal.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThe player uses punishment sparingly and in short, concentrated bursts rather than as a persistent tool. They target individuals who are highly visible focal points (either very high contributors or central to group payoff dynamics), but there is no straightforward alignment with contribution levels; some punishment targets are actually strong contributors. This indicates that their punishment is not a clean, contribution-based “altruistic punishment” pattern. It may reflect a low-confidence attempt to discipline perceived norm violators in a complex environment where others are already heavily punishing, or a reaction to broader group dynamics (e.g., frustration with aggressive punishers, attempts to rebalance status, or confusion about who is responsible for reductions). Overall, they are willing to incur substantial personal cost in isolated rounds to sanction others, but they quickly abandon this and revert to no-punishment once it does not clearly improve outcomes. They never escalate punishment into vendettas across many rounds, suggesting limited taste for ongoing hostility and a primarily instrumental, exploratory use of sanctions rather than sustained spite or moralistic aggression.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nThe player is repeatedly punished by others at several points, often heavily, despite contributing generously. Their behavioral response is not retaliatory: after being hit, they do not systematically punish back the likely offenders, and they do not collapse their contributions in revenge. When their own brief punishment phase ends, it does not track a simple “you hit me, I hit you” logic toward specific individuals. Instead, they maintain or even restore high contributions and typically stop using punishment themselves. This pattern suggests a high tolerance for being targeted, relatively low inclination toward direct retaliation, and a tendency to stabilize the environment by resuming cooperation rather than by entering punishment cycles. Whether they interpret the punishment as unfair or as a coordination attempt is unknown, but behaviorally they display forgiveness or at least non-retaliation and a focus on re-establishing normal cooperative play.\n\n<REWARD>\nThe player shows a clear willingness to spend on rewards, including in situations where reward is structurally weak (one-for-one transfers) and especially near the end. They allocate rewards selectively, often toward players who either contribute less than average or suffer heavy punishment, not just to the highest contributors. This reveals a nuanced, norm-expressive motive: they appear to use reward both as encouragement for lower contributors and as support or sympathy for those being punished severely. The heavy, costly reward expenditure in the final round—despite no future to shape—strongly suggests intrinsic satisfaction from signaling approval or kindness, or a desire to “correct” what they see as unfair outcomes, rather than a purely strategic attempt to change future behavior. They do not mechanically reward all cooperators; their pattern is attentional and targeted, consistent with a socially sensitive, context-responsive rewarder.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThe player receives some rewards from others but does not clearly engage in direct, dyadic reciprocity. They do not reliably reward those who have previously rewarded them, nor do they form stable “mutual reward” alliances. Instead, their reward decisions track broader patterns (who is low, who is hurt, who may need encouragement). This indicates that they do not treat rewards as a transactional currency but as a tool for shaping or expressing group norms. Their lack of targeted reciprocation also aligns with a more impartial or role-based prosocial stance: they reward when a situation seems to call for it rather than because a particular person rewarded them before. Whether they feel gratitude internally is unknown; behaviorally, gratitude does not translate into identifiable tit-for-tat.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThe player appears highly attentive to group payoffs, punishment flows, and reward costs. Their interventions line up with salient imbalances: they sometimes punish individuals who are central in the outcome structure or appear as focal beneficiaries/actors, and they often reward those whose net outcome looks harsh due to heavy deductions or who sit at the lower end of contribution or payoff distributions. They do not chase the absolute top earners or lowest earners in a purely payoff-based way; instead they seem responsive to perceived fairness tensions—cases where someone’s punishment seems excessive or where a low-contributing player might be nudged upward with positive reinforcement. They also avoid engaging in the massive, ongoing punishment wars that some others sustain, suggesting a preference for limiting overall wasteful sanction costs. Overall, their behavioral type is: a mostly unconditional high contributor who is experimentally willing to use sanctions but ultimately gravitates toward gentle, norm-signaling reward and non-retaliatory cooperation, with a strong concern for perceived fairness and the emotional “tone” of others’ outcomes, even when that comes at a personal cost."

They begin by matching or exceeding the apparent cooperative standard and repeatedly choose contributions that are above the group average. Their default inclination is to treat full or near-full contribution as appropriate behavior, suggesting a fairness norm that favors strong public-good provision rather than strict payoff maximization.\n\nThey show some flexibility rather than rigid idealism: after sustaining high contributions, they occasionally lower their input while still remaining roughly in the cooperative range. These downshifts align with periods where many others contribute little or zero, indicating conditional cooperation: they are willing to support the group, but they also respond to visible free-riding by protecting their own payoff. The adjustments are modest rather than extreme, implying they tolerate some inequality and do not immediately collapse their contributions when others defect.\n\nThey appear to value efficiency and group welfare more than short-run personal earnings, given that contributing heavily is individually costly relative to the low marginal per-capita return, yet they persist with high contributions for most of the game. This points to either prosocial preferences, adherence to a “do the right thing” heuristic, or a belief that maintaining high contributions helps stabilize cooperation over time.\n\nThere is no evidence that they deliberately track or mimic any single peer; instead, they respond to the general contribution climate. Their pattern suggests they attend to the distribution of contributions (especially clear low contributors and non-contributors) and then adjust their own level within a relatively narrow band rather than oscillating wildly. Overall, they act as a robust but not unconditional cooperator: they are inclined to lead with generosity, remain cooperative under moderate disappointment, and only partially retreat from cooperation when low contributors persist.\n\nRisk tolerance regarding uncertainty about game length and others’ behavior is medium to high. They repeatedly choose actions that are locally dominated from a purely selfish standpoint, indicating willingness to risk earning less in order to sustain cooperation. However, their later reductions in contribution show that this is bounded: if the cooperative environment erodes, they hedge rather than continuing to fully sacrifice.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThis player never uses the punishment option despite repeated exposure to clear free-riding and consistently identifiable low contributors. Their willingness to punish appears effectively zero in this setting. They do not engage in targeted sanctions against persistent non-contributors or chronically low contributors, even when doing so would be relatively cheap and potentially impactful.\n\nThe absence of any punishment across varying contribution climates suggests a stable underlying disposition rather than simple oversight. At minimum, they are reluctant to impose material harm on others, even anonymous partners, and they do not use punishment as a tool to enforce fairness or reciprocity. Whether this reluctance stems from moral aversion to harming others, doubts about the effectiveness of punishment, or an instrumental desire to maximize their own payoff by avoiding the cost of sanctioning is unknown; the data only support the conclusion that they refrain entirely from punitive action.\n\nThey also never experience punishment themselves, so there is no evidence about retaliatory motives or reactions to being sanctioned. Their non-use of punishment persists despite continued cooperative behavior, which implies they are willing to absorb some exploitation by free-riders rather than pay to discipline them. This is consistent with a “cooperative non-punisher” or “tolerant cooperator” profile: they prefer to adjust their own contributions downward when necessary instead of using costly punishment to shape others’ behavior."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a “stubborn moderate cooperator.” They almost always contribute the same intermediate amount, with only one brief deviation downward and one brief deviation upward. Their default is to give a consistent, non-maximal share that is below what many others give but still far from free-riding. They do not systematically adjust contributions in response to changes in others’ average behavior, even when they are repeatedly the unique low contributor among mostly high contributors, and even when they are singled out by punishment. This suggests they treat their chosen level as a personal fairness norm or comfortable compromise between self-interest and group benefit, rather than using a flexible, conditional cooperation strategy. They show low reactive volatility: feedback from others (via punishment, rewards to others, or shifts in group contributions) does not produce sustained upward or downward trends in their own giving. Their risk tolerance appears moderate: they are willing to undercontribute relative to others despite visibility and sanction risk, but they also avoid extreme free-riding that might trigger harsher responses or collapse group cooperation.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey never use punishment, despite having multiple opportunities and a clear pattern that one specific partner targets them with costly sanctions. This indicates a very high threshold for imposing costs on others and a strong reluctance to spend personal resources for either deterrence or retaliation. Their behavior does not show targeted or proportional sanctions toward lower contributors, nor retaliation against someone who persistently punishes them. From this, it is reasonable to infer that they either (a) view punishment as inefficient or not worth the cost, (b) are conflict-averse and prefer not to escalate, or (c) are focused on maximizing own payoff without engaging in norm enforcement. Because they themselves are consistently under the group’s contribution norm, it is also plausible that they recognize their own vulnerability and avoid a punishment “war”; however, this is uncertain. Overall, they function as a non-enforcer type: they free-ride somewhat on the norm-enforcement efforts of others without joining those efforts.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nWhen another player repeatedly punishes them, they do not retaliate, they do not significantly increase their contribution to align with the punisher’s implicit demand, and they do not shift into a punitive stance toward anyone else. Their contribution pattern remains essentially stable after being sanctioned multiple times, including instances where the sanction is substantial. This indicates that punishment does not successfully coerce them into higher cooperation and does not trigger counter-punishment. They appear to “absorb” the punishment and continue with their own strategy, implying either a strong commitment to their chosen contribution level, indifference to others’ attempts to control their behavior, or uncertainty about how to interpret the sanction. They exhibit behavioral forgiveness or at least non-retaliation: even persistent, costly punishment aimed at them does not change their treatment of the punisher relative to other group members.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey never use rewards, even though several others actively reward high contributors. They do not reciprocate those prosocial signals, and they do not selectively reinforce any partner’s behavior. This suggests that they either place low value on norm-reinforcement via positive incentives, consider the reward mechanism inefficient for their own payoff, or are generally uninterested in actively shaping others’ behavior. The absence of rewarding despite clear evidence that others employ it implies they do not try to join the “prosocial coalition” that uses rewards to sustain high cooperation. Their stance is thus passive with respect to positive incentives: they benefit from a high-contribution environment that others help sustain, but they do not invest in maintaining it.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThey never receive rewards from others in this game, so their direct response to being rewarded is unknown. Because they consistently refrain from using reward on anyone, including players who are frequently rewarding others, it is uncertain whether they would respond with reciprocal reward or higher contributions if they ever were rewarded. There is no behavioral evidence that they attempt to form alliances with rewarders or distinguish rewarders from non-rewarders in their own actions.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey observe a group where several players often contribute close to the maximum and sometimes spend on rewards, while one player regularly devotes substantial resources to punishing them. Despite this, they do not visibly condition their behavior on others’ payoffs, spending, or treatment of them. High contributors’ relatively strong earnings and prosocial signaling do not induce them to match those contribution levels, and the punisher’s lower payoffs (due to punishment costs) do not induce them to exploit that player further or adjust contributions downward. They appear largely indifferent, behaviorally, to whether others are sacrificing for the group (via high contribution or reward) or sacrificing to enforce norms (via punishment). This points to a type that monitors the environment enough to see that cooperation is stable and beneficial, and then “locks in” a personally satisfactory contribution that exploits some of the surplus generated by others’ generosity while avoiding extreme opportunism. Their social style is quiet and self-contained: they neither coordinate with prosocial players nor escalate conflict with punishers, and they maintain their own rule-of-thumb strategy regardless of others’ detailed outcomes."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a moderately prosocial but self-interested conditional cooperator with a clear floor below which they do not want to be exploited. They reliably contribute a substantial, but not maximal, portion of their endowment, anchoring around a stable mid-to-upper range rather than oscillating wildly. Their contributions track the group’s generally high cooperation level: they rarely match the top contributors, but they clearly avoid the lowest contributions when others give little. When the environment looks stable and cooperative, they maintain or slightly increase their own giving. When they personally become a target of sanctions or see that deviating downward is possible, they lower contributions, sometimes sharply, but they do not drop into persistent, extreme free-riding. Even after being penalized for low or zero giving, they return to meaningfully positive, though below-maximum, contributions.\n\nThey appear to use a hybrid rule: a “comfortable” contribution they repeat by default, with adjustments in response to how much others seem to tolerate lower contributions. They do not strictly match others’ exact levels; instead, they stay somewhat below the modal top contributors, suggesting a concern for payoff as well as group welfare. There is no evidence of risk-seeking experiments like all-in contributions or pure defection across the game; they instead display conservative, incremental adjustments. Their fairness norm seems to be: “I should contribute a decent amount, especially if most others do, but I’m entitled to keep a bit more than the very generous players, and if I’m punished I may push back by contributing less.”\n\nOverall, they behave like a cautious, outcome-oriented conditional cooperator: generous enough to sustain high group returns, yet guarded against being the “sucker.”\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey never spend on punishment, even though they themselves are punished multiple times, including at least once very heavily. This strongly indicates a high aversion to costly sanctioning. They are willing to eat deductions rather than retaliate. There is no sign of targeted, low-cost “signal” punishment or of systematic punishment of low contributors or extreme antisocial behavior. This absence persists despite repeated exposure to clear free-riding, unusual contribution patterns, and dramatic overuse of punishment by others.\n\nThis pattern makes it likely that they either (a) believe punishment is not worth the cost to themselves, even when morally justified, or (b) prefer not to take on an enforcement role, leaving norm-policing to others. They appear neither altruistic punishers nor vengeful retaliators. If they update beliefs about punishment, it is expressed through changes in their own contributions, not through sanctioning others. Their type is thus best described as a non-punishing, non-enforcing cooperator: they are responsive to punishment as a signal but not as a tool they themselves deploy.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey never use rewards, despite seeing many others spend heavily to reward cooperators. This suggests they prioritize securing and preserving their own payoff over investing in long-run reciprocity through positive incentives, even when the reward technology is relatively favorable. They do not appear to “tip” high contributors or repay those who benefit them indirectly. Their giving is thus not coupled to a reinforcement strategy aimed at stabilizing cooperation via rewards.\n\nThe consistent absence of rewarding behavior indicates that, for them, cooperation is its own decision problem: they contribute what seems appropriate without additionally paying to shape others’ behavior. They likely view rewarding as optional or inefficient, or they may believe that the prevailing high-contribution norm is strong enough without their intervention. Gratitude, if felt, is not expressed in costly transfers. In type terms, they are a “non-rewarding conditional cooperator”: they follow cooperative norms but do not invest extra to strengthen them.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey clearly pay attention to the environment, but their reactions are expressed almost exclusively through their own contribution choices, not through direct sanctions or rewards. When many others are giving high amounts and the group is generating large payoffs, they maintain solid contributions while keeping themselves slightly below the most generous players, indicating awareness of and adaptation to the prevailing norm. Being punished, especially harshly, does not trigger visible retaliation or a collapse into total free-riding; instead, it is followed by a brief reduction in their own contribution and then a return to intermediate levels. This points to a mix of resentment and cautious pragmatism rather than pure spite or blind compliance.\n\nThey observe extreme behaviors around them: some players over-punish or self-damage massively; others oscillate between low and high contributions; a few wield rewards heavily. None of this draws them into similar extremes. They do not mimic costly moralism, nor do they “give up” when others act erratically. Their adaptation is modest and payoff-focused: they adjust their own giving based on what is tolerated and what seems safe for their earnings, while opting out of the more expressive, identity-laden behaviors of punishing or rewarding.\n\nIn personality terms, they present as a reserved, economically cautious cooperator: willing to shoulder a fair share of the public good, sensitive to how others treat them, but strongly disinclined to spend resources enforcing norms or expressing approval/disapproval through costly mechanisms."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a moderate, relatively stable contributor who stays close to the emerging group norm rather than clearly leading or clearly free-riding. They neither maximize personal payoff by contributing very little, nor adopt a strongly altruistic or high-sacrifice strategy. Instead, they contribute at a middle-to-slightly-below-group level when others are generous, and move slightly upward when the group appears more coordinated and cooperative.\n\nTheir contributions shift within a narrow band rather than showing large volatility. The direction of adjustment suggests some conditionality: they appear sensitive to the pattern of others’ behavior and the broader cooperation climate rather than rigidly sticking to one level. They do not insist on strict equal matching with any specific peer but seem comfortable being “in the pack.”\n\nThey do not exploit clear opportunities to free-ride heavily when others give a lot, implying at least a weak fairness or reciprocity norm. At the same time, they are not willing to consistently over-contribute relative to others, indicating concern for their own earnings and a reluctance to be the “sucker.” Overall, they balance self-interest and group interest, leaning toward cautious cooperation.\n\nTheir behavior is consistent with moderate risk tolerance: they are willing to invest in the public good despite a relatively low marginal per-capita return, but they also protect themselves from extreme downside by avoiding very high contributions.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThis player displays no strong end-game defection pattern. Their cooperation does not collapse as the game approaches its end, and they do not appear to systematically reduce contributions simply because the horizon is short and future reciprocity is limited.\n\nInstead, they remain engaged with the cooperative dynamic through the final round and are willing to contribute at a level that supports the public good. This suggests that they either do not heavily weight standard end-game backward induction logic, or they place meaningful value on maintaining cooperative norms even when future material benefits from reputation or reciprocity are minimal or nonexistent.\n\nThere is no clear evidence that they try to “cash out” aggressively at the end. Horizon awareness is present in the environment but does not drive a sharp strategic shift. Their type can thus be described as weakly or non-opportunistic with respect to the game’s finality, maintaining moderate cooperation through the last available opportunity.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThis player does not use the punishment mechanism at any point, despite punishment being relatively effective in terms of impact per unit cost. They consistently choose to spend nothing on punishment, even when clear deviations from cooperative behavior occur and when they themselves become a punishment target.\n\nThis suggests a reluctance to incur costs to sanction others, consistent with a “non-punisher” or “forgiving by default” profile. They do not engage in norm-enforcing punishment, nor do they retaliate when they are punished. They appear to prioritize preserving their own earnings and/or avoiding escalation over actively shaping others’ behavior through costly sanctions.\n\nTheir inaction in punishment, even when they could reasonably justify sanctioning low contributors or apparent aggressors, implies low inclination toward both deterrence and revenge. This might be due to skepticism about the effectiveness of anonymous punishment, discomfort with harming others even at low cost, or a general preference for letting the group dynamics play out without direct intervention. Based solely on behavior, their underlying motive for abstaining from punishment is unknown, but the pattern itself is clear and stable.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThis player observes others’ contributions, payoffs, and punishment patterns and adjusts their behavior modestly rather than dramatically. They do not react with visible retaliation when punished; instead, they continue to participate cooperatively in the public good at a similar or slightly higher level, which indicates tolerance of unfair outcomes or at least a decision not to escalate conflict.\n\nThey do not appear to condition their actions strongly on who gains or loses from punishment, nor do they attempt to exploit those who have been heavily sanctioned. There is no evidence that they target perceived “winners” or “losers,” likely because they never punish at all. They also do not seem to sharply withdraw cooperation after observing harsh or possibly antisocial punishment patterns from others, suggesting a level of resilience: the presence of punitive behavior in the group does not push them into full defection.\n\nTheir adjustments in contribution suggest that they are aware of the cooperative climate—responding to whether others appear more or less aligned—but they react smoothly rather than with abrupt shifts. They likely infer that some group members are enforcing or disrupting norms, but they continue to focus on a middle-ground contribution strategy rather than actively reshaping outcomes through punishment or extreme cooperation. Their beliefs about the fairness or unfairness of specific punishment decisions are unknown, but their behavioral response is calm, non-retaliatory, and moderately cooperative."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a mostly cooperative, occasionally opportunistic type who alternates between full cooperation and short, isolated bouts of free-riding. They consistently either give everything or nothing, never splitting the endowment. Their dominant pattern is to match a high-contribution norm: when others appear to contribute fully and there is no recent conflict, they fully contribute and sustain that level. However, they occasionally test defection even in a clearly cooperative environment, suggesting some willingness to exploit or probe the limits of the group’s tolerance. These defections are not escalatory or sustained; after facing negative consequences, they switch back to full contributions rather than pushing further. They do not react by overcompensating (e.g., contributing extra when others increase slightly); instead they simply restore the baseline cooperative behavior. Their choices indicate low sensitivity to risk about short-term earnings (they are willing to cooperate even after profitable defection is possible) but moderate sensitivity to social sanctions (see below). Overall, they behave like a conditional cooperator who periodically experiments with selfish deviations.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nAwareness of the finite horizon does not lead this player to unravel cooperation. They maintain full contributions through the final stretch and do not attempt a last-moment free-ride, even when they already know that punishment is a credible threat. There is no sign of increasing defection or “grab what you can” behavior as the end approaches. If anything, their behavior in the later part of the game is more stable and cooperative than in the middle, suggesting that once they internalize the group norm and punishment structure, they prioritize maintaining that pattern over exploiting the final rounds. Any subtle beliefs about others’ end-game behavior are unknown, but observed choices indicate that they do not strategically time defections to the end of the game.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThis player never uses costly punishment, despite clear opportunities to sanction a teammate who occasionally defects (when that player is visible). This holds even after they themselves are repeatedly punished for their own defections, and even when punishment appears effective in shaping their behavior. They show no inclination to retaliate, to enforce norms on others, or to engage in “moralistic” punishment. Their stance appears to be a strict cost-avoidance rule regarding sanctioning: they preserve their own payoff and tolerate others’ mistakes or selfishness rather than paying to correct them. Whether this reflects a principled aversion to punishment, a belief that others will handle enforcement, or simple payoff-maximizing reluctance to spend on sanctions is unknown; what is clear is that they act as a non-punishing, compliance-oriented participant.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nWhen punished, the player reliably adjusts toward compliance rather than escalation. After experiencing deductions tied to their own free-riding, they do not continue or intensify defection; instead, they revert to full contributions and keep them stable for an extended period. They also never respond with counter-punishment, even though punishers are identifiable and they repeatedly bear non-trivial deductions. This pattern indicates high responsiveness to social sanctions and a tendency to treat punishment as a corrective signal rather than as an affront. Their behavior suggests a personality inclined toward accommodation and norm acceptance once boundaries are made clear. Any nuanced emotional reaction (resentment vs acceptance) is unknown, but behaviorally they follow a “get back in line and don’t strike back” pattern after being sanctioned."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a strategic, mixed contributor who alternates between full free-riding and full contribution rather than using intermediate levels. They are clearly aware of the social environment and adapt their choices to the observed pattern of others’ contributions: they sometimes contribute fully when many others are also contributing, and sometimes free-ride despite high group cooperation. Their pattern does not strictly follow a simple conditional cooperator rule (e.g., “match others”); instead, they appear to balance personal payoff maximization with occasional cooperative moves. They do not insist on strict fairness: they are willing both to exploit high contributors and to join them. Their volatility in contribution suggests they are experimenting or strategically toggling between roles rather than following a rigid norm. Their willingness to be among the lowest contributors in some rounds shows tolerance for social risk (being identified and punished) in exchange for higher short-term payoffs. Under uncertainty about others’ future behavior, they appear to test both cooperative and selfish responses rather than commit to one stable identity.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThe player shows awareness of the finite horizon and does not drift into pure end-game defection. Instead, they end with full contribution and receive positive social reinforcement for it, indicating that they maintain or even slightly increase cooperation at the end rather than letting it decay. This suggests that they do not treat the final round purely as a one-shot payoff-maximization opportunity; they remain responsive to established group norms and social feedback even when there is no future interaction within this game. Their final-round cooperation is consistent with a desire to maintain a cooperative image or to be “deserving” in social terms, even if there is no direct future payoff from that reputation in this setting.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThe player consistently abstains from using punishment, despite experiencing multiple instances of being punished themself. This indicates a strong reluctance to spend resources to sanction others, whether for deterrence or retaliation. They do not appear motivated by vengeance, norm enforcement, or payoff equalization via punishment. Even when there are clear low contributors in the group, they choose not to sanction them, suggesting that norm-policing is not part of their strategy. Their behavior is consistent with a type that prefers to adjust own contributions rather than actively shape others’ behavior through costly negative sanctions. Whether this is due to moral aversion to punishment, skepticism about its effectiveness, or simple cost-consciousness is unknown.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nWhen punished, the player does not retaliate through punishment, does not escalate, and does not withdraw into stable defection. Instead, they sometimes move toward cooperation following episodes in which they are targeted. This indicates a relatively non-confrontational, non-retaliatory stance toward punishers: they appear willing to accept negative feedback without engaging in counter-sanctioning. They do not visibly shift to systematically “comply” with presumed punishment demands; their subsequent choices remain mixed rather than becoming uniformly cooperative. Overall, they respond to being punished with mild behavioral adjustment and continued experimentation, not with revenge or entrenched hostility.\n\n<REWARD>\nThe player never uses the reward option, even when there are consistent high contributors and even when they themselves benefit from others’ cooperation. This suggests a strong reluctance to spend resources on positive reinforcement. They do not appear to seek to build alliances or signal gratitude via costly rewards. Their cooperative moves are not accompanied by attempts to shape others’ behavior through incentives; instead, they treat contribution and redistribution as the main levers of interaction. This may reflect a cost-minimizing mindset, indifference to direct reciprocity tools, or uncertainty about the strategic value of rewarding; which of these is primary is unknown.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nWhen they receive reward, the player does not reciprocate with direct reward but does at times maintain or adopt cooperative contributions afterward. They accept positive reinforcement without mirroring it in kind, indicating that they prioritize their own payoff over symmetric reciprocity in the reward channel. However, they do not exploit rewards by immediately reverting to full defection; instead, they remain behaviorally flexible and sometimes continue to cooperate. This pattern fits a type that is receptive to social approval but not willing to pay to return favors in this mechanism. They may internalize reward as confirmation that cooperation is valued, influencing their contribution choices more than their use of the reward tool itself."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a late-converting conditional cooperator with an initial free‑riding bias. When contributing is framed as an all‑or‑nothing choice, they start by consistently taking the selfish option even in a cooperative environment, indicating an initial priority on individual payoff over group welfare. They update their behavior after accumulating social feedback via rewards and punishments, eventually switching to full contribution and then maintaining it to the end. Their shift suggests they are responsive to norms: once it becomes clear that high contribution is the prevailing pattern and is socially reinforced, they align with that pattern. The change is abrupt rather than gradual, implying a strategic “test, then conform” style rather than continual fine‑tuning. They tolerate some personal disadvantage (being punished while not contributing, and later contributing despite lingering low contributors) once they perceive a stable cooperative norm backed by incentives. Their risk tolerance appears moderate: they are willing to experiment with non‑cooperation early, but once they sense that the environment rewards cooperation, they avoid further deviation.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThe player shows no visible end‑game defection: once they switch to full cooperation, they sustain it through the final round despite knowing the horizon. This suggests that, after internalizing the cooperative norm and associated incentives, they are not inclined to exploit the last round for short‑term gain. They appear horizon‑aware in the sense that their behavioral change occurs mid‑game rather than only right before the last round, but they do not display the classic pattern of cooperation decay as the end approaches. Their strategy seems anchored more in current social expectations and payoff structure than in a backward‑induction logic. Whether they explicitly think in terms of end‑game reasoning is unknown, but behaviorally they maintain consistency once settled on a cooperative stance.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThis player never uses punishment, even when others free‑ride more heavily than they do and even after being punished themselves. This indicates a strong reluctance to incur personal cost solely to impose losses on others. They do not appear motivated by retaliation, deterrence, or norm enforcement through negative sanctions. The absence of any punitive response when they are personally targeted suggests they either downplay punishment as a useful tool, accept it as part of the game, or prefer to respond through positive strategies (changing their own contribution or using rewards). Their threshold for using punishment is either very high or principled against using it; which is unclear, but their observed type is a non‑punisher.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nWhen punished while free‑riding, the player does not retaliate and does not try to “punish back,” despite having full opportunity and identifiable punishers. Instead, their later behavioral change moves in the direction that punishers likely want: they increase their contribution and align with the cooperative norm. This suggests a compliance‑oriented or adaptive response rather than vindictive behavior. They appear to interpret punishment (and accompanying reward patterns) as information about prevailing expectations rather than as a provocation. They neither reward nor punish their punishers specifically, so direct targeted reciprocity toward punishers (positive or negative) is not evident; their adjustment is global rather than directed at particular individuals.\n\n<REWARD>\nThe player is willing to spend on rewards and uses them selectively to reinforce cooperative behavior. They reward high contributors while still free‑riding themselves, which indicates a strategic or norm‑signaling use of rewards rather than purely reciprocal gratitude. At times they reward multiple cooperative peers simultaneously, suggesting they care about broadly supporting the cooperative cluster rather than forming a narrow dyadic alliance. The magnitude of rewards remains small relative to potential payoff, consistent with a cautious or budget‑conscious approach: they acknowledge and support cooperation but do not invest heavily in it. They never combine reward with simultaneous punishment, preferring exclusively positive sanctioning. Overall, they act as a low‑intensity positive reciprocator and norm supporter: using reward to encourage cooperation, including cooperation they are benefitting from without yet fully matching.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThe player receives rewards after they begin contributing, and they do not respond by engaging in explicit reciprocal reward toward those specific individuals. Instead, their main response is to maintain cooperative contributions while ceasing to use the reward tool themselves. This pattern suggests that the positive feedback helps stabilize their cooperative choice, but they do not use it to build targeted alliances or tit‑for‑tat reward cycles. They seem satisfied to be recognized and do not escalate reward behavior in response, implying a limited interest in active “reward networks.” Their orientation is more: contribute in line with others and let any further reward dynamics be handled by others. Whether they feel gratitude at a psychological level is unknown, but in strategic terms they answer reward with stable cooperation rather than direct reciprocal transfers."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a highly flexible conditional cooperator–defector who alternates between full free-riding and high contributions rather than settling into a stable pattern. They are clearly aware that others tend to contribute generously and repeatedly face situations where their own contribution is far below the group average, but they do not consistently adjust upward to match that norm. Instead, they sometimes jump to very high contributions, including full or near-full provision, and at other times revert to zero even when others remain generous.\n\nThey does not follow a simple “match-the-average” rule. They contributes nothing in many periods when others are substantially above them, yet in other periods voluntarily moves to the cooperative side, even when others are not unusually generous. This suggests that their decisions are not purely driven by fairness or reciprocity norms. Rather, they appears to be experimenting with different contribution levels or opportunistically choosing between free-riding and cooperating based on short-term payoffs and mood/heuristics rather than a fixed rule.\n\nOver the game, they show no monotonic cooperation decay or simple “end-game defect” pattern. High contributions are scattered throughout the interaction, including late in the horizon, and low contributions are also scattered, including in the middle and late game. This irregularity suggests either low concern with norm consistency, or a player who continually weighs immediate private gain against the public return on a round-by-round basis, without committing to a stable identity as “cooperator” or “defector.”\n\nTheir behavior indicates tolerance for the risk of negative social response: they repeatedly free-ride in cooperative environments where sanctioning is possible, and they continue to do so even after being punished more than once. They appears comfortable exploiting the group when it seems lucrative, and only sometimes chooses to “do their part,” without evidence of a strong guilt or fairness-driven correction.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThe player is horizon-aware in the minimal sense that they know the game length, but there is no clear signature of a sharp end-game collapse. They alternates between high and zero contributions both before and within the final third of the game. In the last several periods, they continues to mix between full free-riding and substantial contributions, including near the final round, instead of shifting to a pure defection strategy.\n\nThis pattern suggests they does not treat the end of the game as a decisive signal to abandon cooperation. Instead, they maintains the same opportunistic, mixed strategy: sometimes cooperating substantially, sometimes free-riding, with no visible tightening toward one extreme linked specifically to the horizon. Any end-game adjustment in their beliefs or incentives is low-confidence/unknown from the transcript; the observable pattern is continued volatility rather than systematic decay or escalation.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThe player uses punishment very sparingly and is not a consistent enforcer. Across the entire interaction, they punishes only in a tiny minority of opportunities, and even then at low intensity. This selective use suggests that they is not motivated by a strong norm-enforcement or altruistic-punishment motive.\n\nGiven that others routinely contribute more than they do, most available targets, when they punish, are not extreme free-riders relative to the group. From this, it is difficult to infer a clear, principled trigger such as “punish those far below the average” or “punish those below my own contribution,” since their own contribution is often at the minimum. It is more plausible that when they do punish, it is either a reaction to having been punished themselves (retaliation) or an ad hoc attempt to influence behavior without a stable fairness rule. However, without seeing the distribution of incoming punishments by target, this remains low-confidence.\n\nTheir punishment intensity is modest rather than maximal. They is willing to spend a nontrivial but small amount to harm another player; they does not appear to invest heavily in deterrence. This indicates that they places more value on preserving their own payoff than on strongly shaping the group’s norms through costly sanctions.\n\nOverall, they is best characterized as a reluctant or instrumental punisher: mostly refraining from punishment, occasionally using it, but not as a central part of their strategy.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nThe player is punished multiple times when free-riding, including in settings where others are cooperating substantially. Despite this, they does not pivot to a stable, higher-contribution strategy. After punishment, they sometimes increase their contribution dramatically in subsequent periods, but they also sometimes continue to contribute nothing after punishments or revert to zero following periods of cooperation. This mixture suggests that punishment does not reliably elicit long-term compliance.\n\nBecause the transcript does not show who punished them, their direct response to specific identifiable punishers is unknown. There is no clear evidence of targeted retaliation: their very rare use of punishment does not obviously track prior low contributions by particular peers, and there is no consistent pattern of them punishing right after being punished. Therefore, their tendency toward revenge against specific punishers is unknown/low-confidence.\n\nAt the aggregate level, they appears tolerant of being sanctioned. They is willing to continue free-riding after having experienced costly deductions, which implies either a relatively low sensitivity to social disapproval or a belief that the expected private gain from free-riding still outweighs the expected cost of further sanctions. Their behavior is consistent with a player who views punishment more as an occasional cost of doing business than as a binding social signal that must be heeded.\n\nIn interpersonal terms, they behaves more as a self-focused, payoff-driven participant than a responsive partner trying to repair their standing with the group or with particular punishers. Their overall style in the face of sanctions is neither clearly conciliatory nor clearly vindictive; it is best characterized as instrumentally indifferent, with limited and inconsistent adjustment."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a consistent low-to-moderate contributor who anchors on a fixed contribution level rather than closely matching the group. They typically give the same mid-range amount regardless of whether others are contributing more or less, suggesting a stable internal “fair” number rather than responsive adjustment. At two points they sharply drop to almost zero contribution while others remain highly cooperative, showing a willingness to free-ride when they choose, even at the risk of standing out. These drops follow earlier periods of high group cooperation and occur despite the clear evidence that contributing more is socially rewarded and norm-consistent, indicating that they prioritize personal payoff over strict fairness or reciprocity.\n\nThey do not increase their contribution in response to having been punished earlier for undercontribution, nor do they attempt to “repair” their reputation when the group heavily sanctions them. This suggests low responsiveness to social pressure and weak conditional cooperation: they do not systematically raise contributions just because others are generous, and they are not easily nudged toward higher cooperation by enforcement. They may see their moderate baseline as already “acceptable,” even when others are doing substantially more, and view the rare very low contributions as justified experimentation or opportunistic defection.\n\nOverall, they behave like a self-interested, mildly cooperative free-rider: willing to put in some amount that is not minimal, but also comfortable benefiting from others’ higher generosity without matching it. Risk tolerance appears moderate: they accept the risk of punishment for conspicuous low contributions, but do not fully exploit the game by always contributing zero, suggesting some concern about norms, future repercussions, or internal discomfort with pure defection.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThis player never spends anything on punishment, despite repeated opportunities and visible instances of others contributing much less or behaving in ways many players do punish. They refrain from sanctioning even clear low contributors, even when such punishment is common in the group and could, in principle, support higher future cooperation. This strongly suggests a “non-enforcer” or anti-punishment stance: they prefer to avoid personal cost to discipline others and are unwilling to trade off their own payoff for norm enforcement.\n\nBecause they never punish, their motives are partly unknown, but several inferences are plausible with low-to-moderate confidence: they may see punishment as inefficient, may dislike the idea of harming others, or may be strategically avoiding being perceived (in expectation) as a punisher in environments where retaliatory punishment is possible. Their consistent abstention, even when they themselves are repeatedly punished, also indicates that they are not retaliatory; they do not use the mechanism to strike back at anonymous aggressors or to try to deter future hits. They appear willing to absorb deductions rather than engage in costly conflict.\n\nThey therefore function as a pure second-order free-rider on punishment: they rely on others to bear the cost of enforcing norms while personally neither contributing to norm enforcement nor adjusting strongly in response to it.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThis player is repeatedly punished for contributing less than the group, especially when they choose very low contributions, yet they do not escalate their contributions or start punishing in response. Their behavior after being sanctioned suggests they accept punishment as a cost of their strategy rather than a signal that prompts cooperation. They do not show clear gratitude or mimicry toward high contributors; instead, even in a highly cooperative environment with many generous players and active punishers, they maintain their own preferred level and occasionally defect further.\n\nThey also witness other low or moderate contributors being heavily punished while high contributors are generally left untouched, making the normative pattern of the group quite salient. Nevertheless, they only partly align: they keep a moderate contribution most of the time but are willing to deviate sharply downward when it suits them. The lack of upward adjustment after observing strong sanctions on others indicates that their beliefs about punishment are either that it is tolerable noise, that enforcement is not credible enough to change their calculus, or that the short-run gain from free-riding justifies the risk.\n\nPersonality-wise, they present as pragmatic, payoff-focused, and relatively thick-skinned: they neither retaliate nor conform strongly, and they avoid investing in social control of others. They appear to treat others’ outcomes and punishment behavior primarily as background information rather than as normative guidance. Their adaptation over time is limited: they test lower contributions, see that these attract costly sanctions, but do not fully back off from this behavior, suggesting either that they undervalue social approval and group welfare, or that they deliberately accept some expected punishment in exchange for higher private benefits. Overall, they resemble a quietly self-interested participant who participates enough to avoid being a total outlier most of the time, but who remains willing to opportunistically exploit cooperative others, and who is largely indifferent to the punishment-and-reward structure shaping others’ outcomes."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a moderately erratic, self-interested conditional cooperator who tracks group behavior but does not commit to a stable norm. Contributions range from full to zero, without a simple monotonic trend. The player sometimes contributes less than almost everyone else, sometimes more than many others, and occasionally matches or exceeds the high-contribution core. This pattern suggests that they understand that contributing can be profitable in a highly cooperative group, but they are willing to free-ride when they feel secure or possibly when they feel mistreated.\n\nThey appear sensitive to social context: when the group is strongly cooperative, they are willing to contribute substantially, including at the maximum. However, they are not anchored to a specific fairness rule such as “match the group average” or “always contribute high”; instead, they vary contributions in a way that appears to balance personal gain, perceived fairness, and reactions to recent punishment against them.\n\nRisk-wise, they tolerate the possibility of drawing punishment by under-contributing, especially when others are contributing a lot, and do not consistently “hide” inside the group average. This points to a moderate risk tolerance and a willingness to test how much deviation is tolerated. There is no consistent upward or downward drift; their behavior looks reactive rather than planned over the horizon. Their fairness norm is mixed: they sometimes behave like a contributor who supports the public good and other times like a calculated free-rider, with no clear long-run commitment to one identity.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThe player is willing to use costly punishment, but sparingly and in a targeted way. They never launch large punishment campaigns; they use single, low-cost units when they do punish. Their punishment is not continuous; there are rounds without any punishment and rounds with a small amount. This intermittent pattern indicates they do not see punishment as a default enforcement tool but as something to deploy in specific situations.\n\nBehavior suggests two likely triggers: (a) frustration or perceived unfairness in how others treat them (they are punished several times despite often contributing reasonably), and/or (b) disapproval of very low contributors relative to a cooperative group. Because punishers are anonymous, the player cannot know exactly who targeted them, but their decision to keep punishing lightly even after being punished themselves indicates they accept punishment as part of the strategic environment and do not fully retaliate in a vindictive way. Any retaliatory motive, if present, is limited rather than explosive.\n\nThe scale and frequency of punishment suggest they are more oriented toward signaling and mild deterrence than maximizing harm: they are willing to pay to impose costs, but they appear cost-conscious and do not escalate. They do not behave like a pure altruistic enforcer who systematically punishes all “defectors” to uphold a strict norm; instead, they act as a selective, low-intensity punisher whose primary goal is likely to nudge or express disapproval rather than to police the entire group. Their threshold for intervening is nontransparent from the data and thus the exact rule they use to choose targets is unknown.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThis player closely tracks others’ contributions and outcomes and uses this information to adjust but not fully anchor their own behavior. They see that most others are generally cooperative and that mutual high contribution yields high payoffs, yet they oscillate between participating in this cooperative pattern and exploiting it. Being punished multiple times does not push them into a clearly cooperative or clearly antisocial trajectory; instead, they continue to mix cooperation and free-riding, and they sometimes punish others even when they themselves have recently been punished.\n\nTheir willingness to keep contributing substantially after suffering deductions indicates that they are not purely spiteful or demoralized by punishment. They accept that others can and will impose costs and continue playing the efficiency game rather than shifting into pure revenge or nihilistic defection. At the same time, they do not “buy” full compliance in return for leniency: they never lock into unwavering high contributions to avoid further punishment.\n\nThey respond to visible extreme behaviors in the group (especially very low contributions against a high-contribution backdrop) with some punitive action, suggesting that they care about relative fairness and the integrity of the cooperative environment, but only to a limited, low-intensity degree. They do not systematically reward high contributors (reward is unavailable anyway) nor do they clearly protect fellow cooperators through differential treatment; their reactions are more about occasional correction than about building reputational alliances.\n\nOverall, they are a self-interested, moderately risk-tolerant conditional cooperator who uses light, selective punishment as a tool to express disapproval or mild deterrence, while remaining willing both to benefit from the group’s cooperation and to exploit it when they judge it profitable or feel aggrieved. Their exact beliefs about others’ intentions are unknown, but their behavior is consistent with expecting a generally cooperative group that tolerates some deviation and some punishment “noise.”"

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a predominantly low contributor who occasionally switches to full cooperation in response to strong cooperative norms or salient coordination opportunities. They consistently choose one of the available extremes (all or nothing) and never mix between them, suggesting a simple, rule-based decision style rather than fine-tuned optimization.\n\nThey frequently free-ride when others contribute substantially, accepting being a clear minority defector among mostly high contributors. This indicates a relatively low concern for fairness in the sense of matching others’ efforts, and a willingness to benefit from public contributions without reciprocating. They tolerate being singled out behaviorally (as one of very few defectors) without self-correcting immediately, so aversion to standing out or being morally judged appears weak or absent.\n\nAt the same time, they do sometimes fully contribute in periods where the group’s cooperative level is high and relatively stable. In those moments, they align with the group rather than exploiting it, suggesting some conditional willingness to uphold a cooperative norm once it feels focal or clearly re-coordinated. Their cooperation is not monotone over time, however: after stretches of defection in a cooperative group, they can still flip back to full cooperation, and then back again to defection later. This points to a volatile “opportunistic conditional cooperator”: they respond to high cooperation with some cooperative episodes, but they do not maintain cooperation reliably, even when others do.\n\nThey show no clear tendency to match specific peers’ contributions or distinguish between high and low contributors in their own contribution choices; their switches are coarse and driven more by broad environment (overall cooperation level and possibly recent payoffs) than by detailed fairness accounting. Risk-wise, they are willing to “risk” cooperating even when others are partly defecting, and willing to “risk” defecting even when others are strongly cooperative and punishments are likely. This suggests moderate risk tolerance and a focus on short-term payoff considerations over social safety.\n\nOverall, their contribution behavior fits an individualistic, payoff-oriented, but not purely selfish type: they primarily exploit cooperation, occasionally join it when it seems salient or rewarding, and do not invest in sustaining high cooperation over time.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThe player shows clear horizon awareness: as the final round approaches, they converge to full contribution and maintain it through the last period. They do not display the classic end-game unraveling where cooperation decays near the end; instead, they move toward cooperation in the penultimate and last rounds.\n\nThroughout the game, their cooperation level fluctuates, but in the final portion of the horizon, once a strong cooperative pattern re-emerges among others, they join it rather than exploiting it one last time. This indicates either (a) a preference for ending on a cooperative, norm-conforming note, or (b) a belief that late cooperation in a highly cooperative environment still yields good payoffs despite the lack of future rounds.\n\nThey do not appear to switch to an aggressively exploitative stance right before the game ends, even though defection would be strategically safe from retaliation in future rounds. This absence of “last-round opportunism” suggests that their opportunism is not tightly coupled to the finite-horizon logic; instead, they seem more responsive to the contemporaneous cooperative climate than to the countdown itself.\n\nIn sum, in end-game conditions they lean toward aligning with group cooperation rather than maximizing one-shot exploitation, which is consistent with a player who is opportunistic but not fully cynical about norms, and who is at least somewhat influenced by the desire to coordinate with the prevailing behavior at the close.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThe player never uses the punishment option at any point, despite frequent opportunities and recurrent punishment directed at them. They also never experiment with minimal or symbolic punishment. This consistent non-use indicates either a deliberate anti-punishment stance, a strong cost-avoidance motive, or an expectation that punishment is ineffective or not worth the expense.\n\nThey receive repeated deductions over many rounds, plausibly linked to their frequent defection when others are cooperative. Yet they do not respond by punishing back, suggesting low inclination toward retaliation or spite. They also do not use punishment instrumentally to discipline low contributors in periods when they themselves cooperate; they rely entirely on others to police norms, if at all, and keep all their coins for payoff rather than norm enforcement.\n\nThis lack of engagement with punishment, even when they are a clear target, suggests that they treat the punishment mechanism as something to be endured or ignored rather than as a strategic tool. They appear to accept being punished as a cost of their strategy, rather than trying to deter it via counter-punishment or using it to shape others’ behavior. Their focus remains on choosing contribution levels, not on influencing the social environment through sanctions.\n\nOverall, they are a non-punishing, non-retaliatory defector-leaning type: they free-ride when advantageous, occasionally cooperate when group norms or payoffs make it attractive, and abstain entirely from costly sanctioning, even in the face of persistent punishment from others."

Their one instance of contributing is isolated and not maintained; it appears more like a strategic test of what happens when they cooperate than a stable norm or commitment to fairness.\n\nTheir contribution pattern is conditional and reactive: after observing that contributing yields a lower payoff than free-riding while others continue to contribute at high rates, they return to non-contribution and stick with it. This suggests a simple, outcome-oriented heuristic: prefer the action that generates higher own payoff given others’ apparent willingness to contribute.\n\nThey do not exhibit a fairness norm focused on equalizing payoffs; they repeatedly accept earning more than most others via free-riding. There is no sign that they are trying to match others’ behavior or “do their part” for the group when that conflicts with their own monetary interest.\n\nRisk tolerance appears moderate: they are willing to try the less individually safe option (cooperating) once, but once the outcome confirms that this reduces their payoff relative to free-riding, they abandon it. This pattern indicates some openness to exploration but a quick return to self-interested exploitation when the environment proves favorable to free-riders.\n\nOverall, the type is best characterized as an outcome-driven opportunistic free-rider: they are attentive to payoff structure, test cooperation briefly, then reliably defect when defection is clearly more profitable.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThe player consistently responds to others’ high contributions and relatively lower payoffs by positioning themselves to benefit from those contributions rather than aligning with them.\n\nWhen others earn less than the player while contributing more, the player does not move toward more cooperative behavior; instead, they maintain or revert to free-riding. This indicates that others’ worse outcomes do not trigger compensatory behavior, guilt, or attempts to restore equity. Rather than being deterred by the evident exploitation of cooperators, the player appears to treat these outcomes as confirmation that free-riding is the best response to the group’s behavior.\n\nThey also seem to treat others’ continuing contributions as a stable resource: as long as enough others keep contributing, the player is content to free-ride. There is no evidence that seeing some peers also free-ride leads them to increase their own contributions to protect the public good. Instead, observing that free-riders can do well or better appears to reinforce their own low-contribution strategy.\n\nBecause there is no punishment or reward available, we cannot observe any direct costly reaction to others’ payoffs. However, the indirect behavioral adjustments strongly suggest that this player is not motivated by others’ welfare or by disapproval of inequality; they update their behavior solely in response to how others’ actions affect the profitability of free-riding versus contributing, and they choose the option that maximizes their own payoff even when it clearly leaves others worse off."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThe player is a predominantly self-interested free rider with occasional, short-lived cooperative deviations. Their default is to keep the entire endowment and rely on others’ contributions. The pattern is highly skewed toward non-contribution, with only rare switches to full contribution. These cooperative moves are isolated and do not convert into a new stable pattern; the player quickly reverts to non-cooperation even when others are contributing at substantial levels.\n\nThe player appears to recognize the incentive structure: they consistently choose the individually payoff-maximizing action given others’ ongoing willingness to contribute. They do not match others’ high contributions, and they accept being the main beneficiary when others act cooperatively. This suggests weak or absent fairness concerns within the game context and a low internalization of efficiency norms (they do not move toward the socially optimal high-contribution outcome even when it is repeatedly demonstrated by at least some co-players).\n\nThere is some evidence of strategic experimentation or momentary norm-following: they contribute fully on a small number of occasions despite strong evidence that free riding yields higher personal payoffs. These cooperative episodes are infrequent and not sustained, suggesting either low commitment to cooperative norms or low confidence that cooperation will be reciprocated in a way that justifies the cost.\n\nOverall volatility is low: they maintain a dominant free-riding strategy with only a couple of brief cooperative departures, not a responsive tit-for-tat or contingent strategy. Their risk tolerance for “wasting” contributions appears low; once it is clear that at least one peer systematically free rides and that contributing does not reliably improve their own earnings, they avoid further costly cooperation. They do not show evidence of using contributions to enforce norms or signal trustworthiness.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThe player is clearly aware of the game horizon: they can see how many rounds remain, and their behavior near the end is consistent with an end-game logic that favors strict free riding. As the game approaches its conclusion, they maintain or intensify their baseline non-contributory stance rather than attempting any last-moment cooperative surge. There is no sign of “final-round generosity” or symbolic cooperation.\n\nCooperation does not decay from a high baseline; instead, the baseline is already low, and it remains low through the end. Occasional earlier contributions do not blossom into a reciprocal pattern that might then unravel; rather, the player continues to choose the safer, individually rational action as the remaining number of rounds shrinks. End-game behavior is thus consistent with a backward-induction style: when future reciprocation is limited or nonexistent, there is no reason, in their revealed preference, to bear the personal cost of contributing.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThe player closely tracks that others sometimes incur substantial costs by contributing while the player benefits disproportionately. They do not respond by adjusting toward fairness or reciprocity when others earn less than them due to their own contributions. Instead, they continue to exploit these cooperative acts, suggesting low sensitivity to outcome inequality inside the game.\n\nThey also witness extended periods where at least one peer contributes regularly and another often free rides, creating a clear contrast in both strategies and resulting payoffs. The player does not align with the contributor out of solidarity, nor do they punish the free rider (not possible in this configuration), nor do they voluntarily “compensate” contributors through increased cooperation. Their main reaction to the outcome structure is to keep choosing the action that preserves or improves their own payoff, irrespective of whether others are advantaged or disadvantaged in that round.\n\nWhen everyone converges on non-contribution and all players earn the same moderate payoff, the player does not treat this equality as a cue to reintroduce cooperation. Instead, they maintain non-contribution, indicating that equality per se does not motivate them toward greater provision of the public good. Their behavior suggests that others’ outcomes matter primarily as an input to understanding what they can profitably free ride on, not as a target to equalize or as a basis for building mutual cooperation. Overall, they act as an opportunistic, low-inequity-aversion type who is comfortable benefiting from others’ costs and does not adjust contributions in response to observed payoff distributions."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a calculated, opportunistic conditional cooperator who mixes moderate giving with frequent free-riding. They treat contribution as a flexible tool rather than a moral rule. Across the game, they alternate between contributing nothing, small amounts, and mid-level contributions, with no long stable pattern; this indicates strategic volatility rather than a fixed “always cooperate” or “always defect” stance.\n\nThey appear highly payoff-focused: they repeatedly exploit situations where others are contributing heavily by giving nothing while still benefiting from the public fund. At the same time, they occasionally contribute moderate amounts even when free-riding would be profitable, suggesting they value maintaining group contribution levels to keep the public fund from collapsing completely.\n\nThey seem sensitive to the general cooperation climate. When group contributions are high or being pushed upward, they often join with a non-maximal, compromise contribution rather than fully matching high cooperators. When contributions are slipping or mixed, they tend more toward zero or low contributions. This pattern suggests they believe others will usually keep contributing enough to sustain a decent fund and that they can ride that while occasionally “topping up” to avoid being a pure exploiter.\n\nThey do not appear strongly fairness-driven in a strict sense; they repeatedly accept payoff advantages over high contributors without visible discomfort. However, they are not purely exploitative either; they show willingness to contribute meaningful amounts periodically, especially when cooperation is salient in the chat or appears to be re-coordinating.\n\nRisk tolerance regarding cooperation is moderate: they are willing to contribute even when there is some risk that others may not, but they often hedge by contributing only partially instead of going all-in. They do not commit to extreme cooperative strategies; instead, they maintain flexibility and reserve the option to revert to free-riding when it seems advantageous or safe.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThe player’s communication is sparse but socially engaged. They never initiate strategic planning about contributions themselves, but they participate lightly in the ongoing social narrative. Their tone is casual and somewhat playful. They respond to others’ prompts or jokes more than they start their own coordination efforts.\n\nThey acknowledge group dynamics with short affirmations and comments, occasionally aligning verbally with others’ remarks. They use brief, low-effort messages rather than long arguments, suggesting low investment in persuasion. There is no clear attempt to instruct others how much to contribute; instead, they comment around the social framing (e.g., playing along with the “wolf” narrative) rather than directly about optimal group strategy.\n\nThey show responsiveness to direct questions or cues from others, but they do not lead. Their engagement style is reactive rather than proactive: they answer, agree, or lightly tease, but they do not push a new cooperative norm or try to rally the group. There is no evidence of anger or moral condemnation; their social demeanor appears even-tempered and somewhat humorous.\n\nOverall, they are socially present enough to blend into the group but strategically opaque: they do not use chat to signal their own contribution intentions reliably, nor to justify their free-riding or contributions.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThis player is clearly horizon-aware: as the game approaches its final rounds, they adjust behavior in ways that reflect recognition of the impending end but do not simply collapse into full defection. In the late phase, they sharply vary between zero and moderate contributions, including returning to nontrivial giving in the final rounds.\n\nThey do not exhibit a smooth monotonic decline in contributions. Instead, they use the endgame to alternate between exploiting high cooperators and occasionally supporting the group when contributions are coordinated upward again. In the final rounds, when group cooperation spikes, they join at an intermediate level rather than going to maximum or minimum, indicating they still care about extracting value from the common pool rather than purely maximizing their last-round private payoff at all costs.\n\nThere is no explicit verbal reference to the game ending, but behavior shows that they are no longer experimenting or searching for a norm; they are exploiting known patterns (others’ tendency to contribute) while still contributing enough not to be an outlier. This suggests a pragmatic end-game mindset: prioritize earnings, but keep the group’s cooperation engine running if it is still beneficial.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThe player pays attention to others’ contributions and resulting payoffs, as evidenced by the way their own contributions track the overall cooperation climate. When others contribute heavily and bear more of the cost, they are willing to enjoy the payoff advantage and do not visibly express guilt or gratitude. They tolerate payoff asymmetries that favor them without remark.\n\nTheir chat responses occasionally reflect awareness of behavior patterns (such as identifying who is acting “wolf-like”), but they do not directly criticize or praise specific payoff outcomes. They do not publicly confront high contributors or low contributors, nor do they explicitly complain about being exploited; this suggests a relatively nonjudgmental stance toward inequality in outcomes.\n\nInstead of moralizing, they adapt quietly: if others keep the fund high, they lean toward freeriding; if others start cutting back or re-coordinating, they increase their own contribution somewhat. This indicates that others’ outcomes function for them primarily as strategic information rather than emotional triggers.\n\nBecause punishment and reward are unavailable, there is no direct evidence of how they would use such tools. However, their tolerance for enjoying advantages without commentary hints that, if such mechanisms were present, they might be reluctant to spend resources punishing or rewarding others and would instead rely on silent strategic adjustment. Overall, they appear outcome-aware and opportunistic, but socially low-conflict and emotionally muted in response to others’ gains or losses."

Their default pattern is to keep their entire endowment and let others fund the public good. Full contributions occur only a few times and do not persist; they are isolated choices rather than the start of a cooperative streak.\n\nThey strongly exploit any cooperative environment that emerges. When others contribute highly, they reliably continue to free-ride rather than reciprocate. They still free-ride even when others’ cooperation is stable, indicating low intrinsic motivation for fairness or efficiency and a focus on personal gains over group outcomes.\n\nTheir cooperation appears weakly conditional at best: early in the game, they sometimes contribute when others are contributing substantially, but they quickly shift to a robust non-contribution strategy despite continued contributions from others. This suggests that early cooperation is either exploratory or based on a short-lived fairness or norm-testing impulse, which is then overridden by the clear monetary advantage of defecting.\n\nThey do not show gradual adjustment or partial giving; choices are binary and polarized between full contribution and full defection. Once they settle into free-riding, their behavior is highly stable with two late “exceptions” that look more like experiments or noise than true norm-following. Because they occasionally contribute even when free-riding is clearly more profitable given others’ behavior, some minor weight on norms, curiosity, or desire to probe others’ responses is possible, but overall their revealed preference is strongly payoff-driven.\n\nGiven the multiplier is lower than the marginal private return from keeping coins, their behavior is consistent with a player who understands that unilateral defection is individually optimal, and who is willing to accept persistent payoff inequalities in their favor. Fairness concerns, if present at all, are weak and easily dominated by self-interest. Risk tolerance appears moderate: they are willing to depend on others’ cooperation for surplus while taking no personal risk of loss, rather than trying to “lead” or stabilize group cooperation at personal cost.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThis player consistently responds to others’ outcomes in a self-serving, exploitative way. When others earn less because they contribute more, the player continues to free-ride and does not shift toward cooperation to reduce inequality. When others cooperate heavily and earn strictly less than the player, the player maintains or even reinforces their free-riding stance, accepting a role as a beneficiary of others’ sacrifices.\n\nThey do not appear to “reward” high contributors through their own behavior; cooperative actions by peers do not lead to matching contributions, even when cooperation is widespread and sustained. Similarly, they do not appear to “punish” defectors through increased contribution or any costly action; when others reduce their contributions and receive lower payoffs as a result, the player does not step in to support the public fund.\n\nChanges in others’ payoffs occasionally coincide with the player switching to contribution, but these switches are not followed by sustained cooperative behavior and often run counter to immediate self-interest. This makes it difficult to attribute these changes to systematic fairness, reciprocity, or guilt; they more plausibly reflect low-confidence experimentation or momentary deviation rather than a stable prosocial rule. There is no evidence of strong emotional or moral reactions to inequality; the player tolerates large payoff advantages over cooperators without adjusting their strategy.\n\nOverall, the player behaves as a rational free-rider who tracks that defection reliably yields higher or equal payoffs than contribution, and they act accordingly. Their observed responses suggest weak or absent inequality aversion, minimal concern for group efficiency once the cost to themselves is salient, and little inclination to use their own behavior as a signal to coordinate on higher collective outcomes."

Across the game, contributions cluster heavily on taking the entire endowment for themselves. Full contributions are rare, appear in isolated instances, and do not establish a stable cooperative pattern.\n\nCooperative moves do not consistently follow others’ cooperation or defection in a simple tit-for-tat manner; instead, the player alternates between exploiting cooperative environments and briefly joining them. The switches between contributing and not contributing are frequent enough to count as volatile rather than stable, but they are not random: they preserve the player’s long-run advantage over most peers.\n\nThe player shows no clear fairness norm based on equalizing payoffs. They are frequently content to earn more than cooperative others and sometimes allow others to earn more than them without clearly retaliating via contribution changes in the next decision. This suggests they prioritize absolute payoff over strict payoff equality, and do not appear strongly inequality-averse in either direction.\n\nRisk tolerance appears moderate to low in social terms: the player does not invest consistently in the public good even when there is a clear pattern of others contributing. They rarely “test” sustained high-contribution profiles; instead, they often choose the safe, individually dominant free-riding option and let others bear the uncertainty of contributing.\n\nOverall, their default behavioral anchor is non-contribution, with occasional cooperative deviations that do not evolve into a stable norm and do not reliably punish or reward particular partners.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThe player is observably sensitive to the payoff structure but does not systematically condition on specific others’ earnings in a norm-enforcing way. They often allow themselves to benefit when others’ cooperation produces high group returns and do not incur any cost to correct or reciprocate those differences.\n\nWhen cooperative others receive notably lower payoffs than defectors (including themselves), the player does not shift into a consistently cooperative stance to protect or reward those individuals. Any cooperative bouts are short-lived and not tightly aligned with improving or defending others’ outcomes. This indicates a low propensity for altruistic compensation or reciprocity driven by concern over others’ relative losses.\n\nLikewise, when some peers clearly earn substantially less due to contributing while others free-ride, the player does not respond by “joining” the contributors to even the playing field in a sustained way. There is no evidence of targeted response to particular identities (e.g., consistently aligning with or against specific other players); their contribution pattern does not track any one peer’s fortunes.\n\nBecause neither punishment nor reward is available, the only way to react to others’ outcomes is via future contributions. The player does not use this channel as a consistent sanctioning or rewarding tool. Their non-contribution phases continue even after repeated opportunities to “support” apparent cooperators, and their occasional contributions do not persist as long-term support once exploitation becomes attractive again.\n\nIn sum, the player tracks payoffs enough to protect their own earnings but does not display structured, outcome-contingent responses meant to improve or worsen others’ payoffs; their reactions are best characterized as payoff-seeking rather than norm-enforcing or relationship-oriented."

Contribution behavior is volatile rather than stable: they switch multiple times between contributing and not contributing over the game, which indicates ongoing updating rather than a fixed plan from the start.\n\nThey display **conditionality** that is sensitive to the recent pattern of others’ contributions and to their own payoffs. After experiencing high personal payoffs while not contributing, they are willing to keep defecting even when others still contribute. When they try contributing and see that others exploit that by not contributing, they quickly revert to defection. This shows they track payoff consequences and react to perceived exploitation.\n\nAt the same time, they occasionally return to full contribution even after being exploited, suggesting they are not a pure money-maximizing egoist. Instead, they periodically test whether a more cooperative regime can be re-established. These cooperative moves are not random; they tend to appear when at least one or more others are still contributing or when contribution levels have fluctuated recently. That pattern indicates **hopeful but cautious conditional cooperation** rather than blind altruism.\n\nThey do not enforce a strict fairness norm (such as “I only contribute if almost everyone else does”). They are willing both to free-ride on clear cooperators and to join them at a cost to themselves. This points to **flexible norms**: they value higher individual payoffs but are willing to sacrifice some payoff to support or probe group cooperation under uncertainty.\n\nRegarding risk tolerance, they show **moderate risk acceptance in social terms**: they sometimes choose to contribute even when recent history makes exploitation by defectors likely. However, when a cooperative move is immediately met with substantial non-contribution from others, they react by reverting to the safer, higher-earning option of defection, indicating they do not tolerate sustained one-sided sacrifice.\n\nOverall, this player uses a **responsive, payoff-aware conditional strategy**: defaulting to free-riding, occasionally shifting into cooperative tests when there is some evidence or hope of group cooperation, and retreating quickly when those tests are not reciprocated.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThis player closely attends to how others’ choices translate into payoffs and adjusts behavior accordingly, even though they lack direct channels to communicate or sanction.\n\nThey appear largely **instrumental rather than empathetic** in their response to others’ outcomes. When others earn substantially less because they contributed while the player did not, the player does not shift immediately out of concern for their disadvantage; instead, they continue defecting if it is advantageous. This suggests that reducing payoff inequality or avoiding guilt is not their primary driver.\n\nHowever, they are **not purely exploitative**. Even after periods where defecting yields high payoffs for them and low payoffs for contributors, they sometimes switch to contributing, which lowers their own payoff relative to continuing defection. That pattern is consistent with a belief that **group outcomes might improve if enough players coordinate**, and they are occasionally willing to bear short-term losses to probe for such coordination.\n\nThey show **sensitivity to being on the losing side of others’ free-riding**. When they contribute and observe that others manage to secure higher payoffs by not contributing, they respond by abandoning cooperation in subsequent decisions. This indicates a strong aversion to being the “sucker” and a basic **reciprocity/retaliation logic**: they do not punish directly (no such mechanism exists), but they “punish” uncooperative environments by withdrawing their own cooperation.\n\nConversely, when they see patterns where multiple others are cooperating or at least some are repeatedly contributing, they become more willing to join them, implying **positive responsiveness to cooperative signals**, even in the absence of explicit rewards. The player seems to interpret others’ outcomes as **informative signals about likely future behavior** rather than as moral facts requiring redress.\n\nIn environments where others’ outcomes show that cooperation is unstable and easily exploited, they gravitate toward defection and maintain it. When others’ outcomes suggest that cooperation might be mutually beneficial and somewhat reciprocated, they intermittently support it. There is no evidence of them seeking to maximize or minimize inequality per se; their reactions are best explained by **adaptive, payoff-based learning about the strategic environment** rather than by strong pro-social or anti-social motives."

Their contributions oscillate between full cooperation and full defection rather than drifting gradually, suggesting deliberate switches rather than noise.\n\nThey initially cooperate fully despite visible free-riding by several others, indicating a willingness to test or support cooperation even when it is not yet majority behavior. After seeing that non-contributors earn strictly higher payoffs than contributors, the player temporarily becomes a pure free-rider, taking advantage of others’ willingness to contribute. This shows they are attentive to payoff structures and willing to exploit cooperative environments once these are revealed.\n\nThey do not lock into a permanently selfish stance, however. After benefiting from others’ giving, they later return to full contribution even when cooperation appears less common and less profitable. This reversal implies that their behavior is not guided solely by immediate monetary gain. Possible motives include an internal fairness norm, a desire to “do their part” at least some of the time, or experimentation with how contribution levels affect group behavior and returns. Because they resume full contributions even when this is personally costly relative to free-riding, their risk tolerance for earning below others in a given round is moderate: they accept lower short-run payoff to test or uphold cooperative behavior.\n\nAcross the sequence, they display conditionality that is more sensitive to payoff comparisons and group patterns than to simple majority behavior. They cooperate in some settings where cooperation is not dominant, and defect in some settings where others remain generous. This indicates they may be tracking perceived trends or testing hypotheses about the environment (e.g., “What happens to returns if I switch?”) rather than following a simple “match the majority” rule. Their fairness norm appears conflicted: they are willing to exploit and to sacrifice in different moments. Overall, they are best described as an exploratory, payoff-aware conditional cooperator with intermittent self-serving defection and a non-stable contribution pattern.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThe player is highly responsive to others’ payoff outcomes and clearly notices the payoff advantage of free-riding over contributing. After observing that defectors systematically earn more than cooperators, they promptly shift to full defection and maintain it while others continue to contribute, which shows that upward payoff comparisons matter and can trigger opportunistic behavior. They appear comfortable benefiting from others’ contributions without immediately reciprocating, so they do not hold a strict norm of avoiding advantageous inequality.\n\nLater, they voluntarily return to full contribution even when this choice yields lower earnings than that of some free-riders. This indicates that their response to payoff differences is not purely envy-driven or maximization-based; they tolerate disadvantageous payoff positions when they choose to act cooperatively. This suggests a mixed motivational profile: they react strongly to evidence that “suckers” lose out and temporarily avoid that role, yet they are also willing to re-enter a cooperative role even when it is known to be less lucrative.\n\nSince no punishment or reward is available in this environment, their reactions are expressed only through their own contribution choices. They neither exit cooperation permanently in response to exploitation by others nor blindly continue giving in the face of persistent free-riding. Instead, they update their behavior in both directions, which is consistent with an adaptive learner who uses others’ outcomes as feedback about when cooperation seems “worth it” or normatively appropriate. Their social preference type, inferred solely from these outcome-contingent switches, is an outcome-sensitive, ambivalent cooperator: they respond to payoff inequalities by alternating between opportunism and renewed attempts at cooperative contribution."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a conditional, payoff-attentive cooperator who starts fully cooperative and then shifts to full free-riding once patterns in others’ behavior and payoffs emerge.\n\nThey reliably choose extreme options (all-or-nothing), never using intermediate contributions when unavailable; this offers no information about their finer-grained preferences. Early behavior shows willingness to bear a substantial personal cost to support the group, even when others are not uniformly cooperative, which is consistent with an initial cooperative or norm-following inclination rather than pure self-interest.\n\nOver time, they become markedly more self-interested: they transition from always contributing to always keeping their endowment, despite the public fund remaining profitable. This shift coincides with persistent coexistence of contributors and non-contributors and with clear evidence that free-riders can earn as much or more than cooperators. Their later decisions are best interpreted as responsive to the observed incentive structure rather than random; they appear to recognize that taking the endowment while others give yields high payoffs and then act accordingly.\n\nThey do not appear to enforce or follow a strong fairness norm that would require everyone (including themselves) to contribute when the group is still producing large gains; instead, they accept an outcome where others contribute and they do not. There is no evidence of altruistic sacrifice beyond the initial cooperative stance, and no sign of “moral stubbornness” in the face of others’ free-riding: once they see that cooperation is not universal and that defectors do well, they join the defectors.\n\nRisk attitudes are partially observable. They show no sign of risk aversion with respect to the social environment in the early phase: they commit fully to cooperation despite uncertainty about others. Later, their switch to free-riding is payoff-improving and low-risk given the ongoing presence of multiple contributors, suggesting a pragmatic, outcome-oriented approach rather than a risk-seeking gamble.\n\nIn summary, their contribution pattern is: start as a full cooperator under uncertainty, then adapt toward full defection as evidence accumulates that others free-ride and that non-cooperation yields higher or at least competitive payoffs. Their cooperation is conditional on perceived reciprocity and on not feeling exploited, rather than unconditional or purely principled.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThis player is observant of outcome patterns and adjusts strategy based on realized payoffs, but there is no evidence of punitive or rewarding behavior, nor of direct emotional reactions, because no explicit punishment/reward actions occur in the game.\n\nThey repeatedly experience situations where non-contributors earn as much or more than contributors, and they update their behavior in a manner consistent with learning from these comparisons. When they and other full contributors earn less than free-riders, they subsequently align with the more profitable free-riding pattern. This suggests that they attend to relative earnings and are sensitive to being at a disadvantage, even if they do not have instruments to express disapproval directly.\n\nThey do not respond to cooperative behavior by reciprocating once they have turned to free-riding. Even when multiple peers continue contributing and thereby sustain a highly profitable public fund, they keep their own contributions at zero while benefiting from others’ generosity. This indicates that positive outcomes for others, by themselves, are not sufficient to elicit renewed cooperation once they have reclassified the situation as one where free-riding is acceptable or norm-consistent.\n\nBecause formal punishment and reward are unavailable, it is unknown whether they would be willing to incur a cost to sanction free-riders or to reward cooperators in other environments. There is also no direct information about emotional responses (e.g., guilt, resentment, gratitude); all inferences are based on strategy changes. With that caveat, their pattern suggests a primarily payoff-driven response to others’ outcomes: they imitate the more profitable role (free-rider) rather than trying to influence the group, and they tolerate inequality when it is in their favor."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThe player fits a “strategic opportunist with weak cooperative commitment” profile.\n\nThey are willing to make full contributions but do not maintain them. Their behavior alternates between fully cooperative and fully free-riding choices, with no gradual adjustments. This indicates high volatility rather than a stable norm-following pattern.\n\nThey begin by fully cooperating despite many others not doing so, which suggests an initial willingness to support group efficiency even when it is not strictly payoff-maximizing in a one-shot sense. However, once they see that many peers free-ride and earn more, they quickly switch to full free-riding and sustain this for multiple rounds, implying that perceived unfairness or exploitation pushes them toward self-interested behavior.\n\nThey appear sensitive to relative payoffs: their shift away from contribution coincides with situations where contributors earn less than non-contributors. When free-riding, they maintain that stance even as others continue to contribute, indicating a readiness to benefit from others’ cooperation rather than a strong reciprocity norm.\n\nTheir eventual return to full contribution is not easily explained by a simple “imitate-the-majority” or “always defect after being exploited” rule; the environment at that point still contains a mix of contributors and free-riders. This suggests some internal tension between self-interest and a desire to occasionally support the public good. However, the pattern as a whole skews toward maximizing own payoff while opportunistically taking advantage of others’ cooperation.\n\nRisk tolerance appears moderate: they initially accept the risk of being exploited by non-contributors, but after observing payoff disadvantages they mostly avoid that risk. There is no evidence of them sacrificing payoff to enforce a fairness norm; instead, they accept the existing mix of behaviors and adjust primarily for personal gain.\n\nOverall, they do not follow a pure “conditional cooperator” rule (contribute if others contribute) nor a pure “unconditional defector” rule. They behave more like an outcome-sensitive opportunist: briefly cooperative, then predominantly free-riding when it is clearly advantageous, with a late cooperative move that is not systematically tied to the group’s average but may reflect a residual preference for contributing or experimentation. Their fairness norm is weak: they notice the payoff asymmetry but respond by imitating exploitative behavior rather than trying to uphold a cooperative standard.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThe player clearly monitors others’ outcomes and incorporates them into their strategy. When non-contributors earn more than contributors, they adjust in the direction of those higher-earning strategies, indicating that relative payoff comparison strongly influences their decisions.\n\nThey do not incur any cost to alter others’ payoffs, even when mechanisms for punishment or reward are conceptually available in the environment description. Since actual punishment and reward actions are absent in the transcript, their willingness to use such tools is unknown. However, their shift to free-riding instead of attempting to “correct” others’ behavior suggests they respond to inequality by adapting their own strategy rather than by enforcing norms.\n\nThey appear largely tolerant of payoff differences as long as they are not personally disadvantaged. When they themselves are on the losing side of the payoff comparison, they change their contribution level to escape that disadvantage. When they are on the winning side, they do not move toward more fairness; they maintain payoff-superior free-riding. This pattern is consistent with payoff-driven adaptation rather than strong inequity aversion.\n\nTheir late return to full contribution occurs in a context where contributors and free-riders still coexist and where their own payoff from contributing is not clearly superior to free-riding. This indicates that their reaction to others’ outcomes is not purely mechanical imitation of the highest earner. It may reflect a limited willingness to sometimes align with cooperative peers despite the risk of being out-earned, but the evidence is weak and confidence in this interpretation is low.\n\nIn sum, they are attentive to others’ payoffs but primarily use that information to avoid being exploited and to position themselves among the higher earners, rather than to promote equality or punish exploitation. Their response to others’ outcomes is best characterized as self-oriented benchmarking rather than norm-enforcing behavior."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is best characterized as a predominantly selfish free-rider with a brief, exploratory deviation toward cooperation.\n\nThey consistently choose the individually payoff-maximizing option of keeping their entire endowment when possible. Their modal behavior is to contribute nothing while benefiting from the contributions of others. The one instance of contributing their full endowment appears atypical rather than a stable preference; it looks more like a test of what happens if they cooperate than a genuine shift in strategy.\n\nTheir pattern suggests low adherence to fairness or equality norms. They repeatedly position themselves on the high-earnings side relative to contributing peers and do not persist in cooperative behavior even after observing that the group continues to supply public contributions. The solitary cooperative move is not followed by any sustained attempt to share the burden of funding the public good.\n\nThey show conditionality that is weak and short-lived. After initially free-riding while others contribute substantially, they briefly switch to full contribution once it is clear that many group members are willing to put in resources. However, when this cooperative act predictably reduces their own payoff relative to other non-contributors, they immediately revert to full free-riding and maintain that stance. This indicates that their conditional cooperation, if any, is highly sensitive to immediate personal payoff comparisons rather than to group outcomes or norms.\n\nThey are payoff-focused and risk-averse to personally costly cooperation. When cooperation involves a clear relative loss compared to defectors, they abandon it and show no sign of experimenting further. They do not appear to take altruistic or “investment” risks for the sake of the group; the one cooperative act is quickly “corrected” once it proves individually disadvantageous.\n\nOverall, their contribution rule in similar environments is likely:\n- Default: contribute nothing.\n- Possible exception: briefly test full contribution early or midstream if others seem cooperative, but discontinue if this harms relative payoff.\nThey do not show gradual adjustment or intermediate contribution levels here (only all-or-nothing is available), but given their reactions, if partial contributions were allowed, they would likely choose low or zero levels unless doing more clearly protects or improves their own relative standing. Confidence in this extrapolation is moderate.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThe player pays close implicit attention to payoff rankings and uses them to guide behavior. After seeing that defectors earn more than contributors under the existing group pattern, they align themselves with the better-paid group (the non-contributors) and remain there. Their one cooperative act is immediately followed by a shift back to free-riding once it yields a lower payoff than that of non-contributors while still leaving contributors in the group.\n\nThey show no evidence of reciprocity toward high contributors in terms of adjusting their own behavior to protect or reward them. Even when others continue to invest in the public fund alongside clear non-contributors, this player chooses to remain in the advantaged defector position. This suggests low concern for inequality that favors them and little inclination to incur costs to support cooperators.\n\nThere is no punishment or reward mechanism in this environment, so direct enforcement responses cannot be observed. However, their behavioral adjustments indirectly “reward” free-riders (by joining them and confirming that defection is payoff-maximizing) and “penalize” cooperators (by refusing to share the contribution burden). This is consistent with a competitive or at least self-centered orientation: they appear more motivated by maintaining a favorable payoff position than by maximizing group welfare.\n\nThey exhibit rapid learning from outcome feedback: a single experience of being worse off than defectors while contributing is sufficient to shift them back to defection and keep them there. There is no sign of longer-term experimentation with different strategies to see if group outcomes improve; outcome sensitivity is short-horizon and self-focused.\n\nTheir likely response pattern in new PGGs is:\n- Track whether cooperators earn more or less than defectors.\n- If defectors are doing at least as well or better, continue to defect.\n- If cooperation were somehow tied to strictly higher personal payoffs, they might be willing to cooperate instrumentally, but not out of principle.\n\nTheir personality style, as inferred from outcomes, is instrumental and self-regarding rather than norm-driven or pro-social. They are responsive to others’ outcomes mainly as signals for how to secure or preserve their own advantageous position. Concern for relative payoff and avoidance of being the “sucker” being exploited by others’ defection are prominent; concern for mutual benefit beyond their own gain is weak or unknown but likely low."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a generally high contributor who alternates between full cooperation and moderate free-riding. They often give the entire endowment or half of it, rarely contributing very little. Their pattern suggests conditional cooperation: they appear more willing to give fully when others are also giving high amounts, and they reduce to a mid-level contribution when they either test or exploit a cooperative environment. They are not purely self-sacrificing; they balance own payoff with group returns and sometimes keep a substantial portion despite others’ full cooperation. Their behavior indicates awareness that high group contributions are profitable, but they are willing to deviate downward when they can still benefit from others’ generosity. Contribution choices are somewhat volatile but within a narrow band (medium vs. maximum), hinting at experimentation or mild strategic adjustment rather than random play. They appear comfortable taking advantage of a cooperative norm at times, but not to the extreme of contributing nothing. Their risk tolerance is moderate: they repeatedly invest heavily even after seeing others defect or fluctuate, implying they are willing to risk being the “sucker” occasionally to preserve or regain high group payoffs.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThe player communicates very little and only engages once the group has already established a norm and called attention to their behavior. They respond briefly and directly when someone questions their contribution, using a short reassurance that implicitly acknowledges group expectations and seeks validation. They do not initiate coordination proposals, explanations, or persuasion; they let others lead the norm-setting discussion. Their tone is cooperative and non-confrontational; there is no sign of irritation or defensiveness, and they appear willing to align with the group once attention is on them. Overall, they adopt a low-visibility, reactive communication style: they monitor the chat, intervene minimally, and only speak when socially prompted.\n\n<REWARD>\nThe player uses rewards sparingly and selectively. They are willing to spend on rewards but do so infrequently, suggesting that they reserve rewarding for specific situations rather than routine reinforcement. Their first use of rewards occurs in a context where cooperation is already very high, indicating that they may use rewards more as a signal of appreciation or encouragement than as a tool to change poor behavior. They do not systematically reward every instance of strong cooperation, nor do they appear to run a consistent “reward-the-highest-contributor” strategy. They receive rewards in several cooperative contexts, which may reinforce their sense that contributing relatively high amounts is socially approved, but their own rewarding does not clearly escalate in response. Overall, they show a moderate willingness to reward, with no evidence of targeted strategic reinforcement or explicit gratitude signaling beyond the bare act of rewarding itself. Their reward behavior suggests they tentatively support prosocial norms but prioritize conserving their own payoff over actively incentivizing others."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a high, mostly unconditional contributor who occasionally experiments with self-serving deviations. For most of the game, they give either the full endowment or very close to it, even when one group member persistently contributes very little. Their behavior shows a strong cooperative baseline that is not tightly conditioned on exact fairness or full reciprocity from all group members.\n\nThey are not perfectly rigid: they reduce their contribution a few times, including at least one sharp drop. These deviations do not become a new stable pattern; they return to high contributions afterwards. This suggests opportunistic testing or short-run self-interest rather than a committed switch to defection.\n\nThey tolerate inequality: they keep contributing a lot despite one clear low contributor and without any visible coordination to punish or isolate that player. They appear more focused on sustaining group provision with the reliable high contributors than on enforcing strict fairness norms on everyone.\n\nRisk tolerance is moderate-to-high in social terms. They consistently expose themselves to the risk that others might reduce contributions later, yet they keep cooperating. Economically, they do not exploit the individually rational strategy of free-riding for most of the game. This implies a cooperative orientation or prosocial preference rather than pure payoff maximization.\n\nOverall, their contribution profile fits a “cooperative but occasionally opportunistic” type: they default to strong cooperation, are robust to some free-riding, but are not entirely immune to short-term temptation as the game unfolds.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThey never send any chat messages and never respond directly to others’ comments, despite sustained attempts by others to coordinate and express appreciation. This indicates a silent, non-engaging communication style: they observe others’ talk but do not participate.\n\nThe lack of verbal coordination, combined with consistently high contribution levels, suggests they treat the game as an individual decision problem rather than as a social negotiation. They allow others to set the cooperative norm in chat but follow or adjust based on observed actions, not on conversation.\n\nTheir silence is not clearly hostile or supportive; it is more neutral/withdrawn. They do not publicly endorse the cooperative norm, do not complain about free-riders, and do not express gratitude when rewarded. This makes them socially opaque to others: they contribute like a strong cooperator but do not signal intentions or emotions verbally.\n\nResponsiveness to others’ communication is unknown in content terms; however, their behavior loosely tracks the group pattern (staying mostly aligned with the high contributors), which suggests they are at least paying attention to outcomes and possibly inferring norms indirectly from others’ talk.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThey are aware of the game horizon, as the interface displays remaining rounds, but they do not show a steady cooperation decay as the end approaches. They continue to contribute at or near full even when very close to the final round, including in the last round itself.\n\nThere is one marked low contribution late in the game, but it does not trigger a sustained shift to defection in subsequent rounds. Instead, they quickly revert to high contributions, including at the end. This pattern does not match a classic end-game unraveling strategy; it is more consistent with a one-off deviation or exploration.\n\nThey do not appear to condition their last-round behavior on reciprocal expectations or “last chance” exploitation. Their final-round choice aligns with their early-game cooperative mode, indicating either a stable internal norm of contribution or low salience of finite-horizon strategic thinking.\n\nIn summary, their strategy is only weakly shaped by end-game incentives; they maintain substantial cooperation rather than exploiting the final period.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey never spend any coins on rewarding others, even when others contribute maximally and express appreciation in chat. This shows a strong reluctance to incur personal costs for positive sanctions in this institutional setting.\n\nGiven the cost-benefit structure of reward (costly and efficiency-reducing from an individual standpoint), their behavior is consistent with self-interested evaluation of the reward mechanism: they are willing to cooperate via contributions but not willing to spend additional resources to reinforce others’ cooperation.\n\nThey receive rewards multiple times but do not reciprocate with reward spending, even toward those who likely rewarded them or consistently contributed highly. This absence of observable rewarding suggests they do not use reward as a strategic tool for alliance-building, reciprocity, or norm enforcement.\n\nThey rely entirely on their own contribution choices to influence outcomes and never attempt to shape others’ behavior via the reward mechanism. Their incentives appear to prioritize preserving their payoff over actively supporting or thanking others financially.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThey are rewarded on several occasions, but their subsequent behavior shows no clear change in contribution pattern that can be directly linked to being rewarded, and they never reward anyone in return. There is no observable direct reciprocity in the use of the reward mechanism.\n\nTheir contributions remain generally high before and after receiving rewards, so it is unclear whether reward has any motivational effect beyond what their baseline cooperative preference already dictates. Any internal feeling of gratitude is behaviorally invisible: they do not respond in chat and do not repay via rewards.\n\nIf they recognize specific rewarders, this recognition does not manifest as targeted behavioral changes (either extra contributions or reward-giving). Their response to being rewarded is thus best characterized as neutral in terms of observable strategy—no retaliation, no alliance formation, no signaling.\n\nOverall, they behave as a cooperative contributor who is largely indifferent, at least behaviorally, to the reward system and does not engage in explicit reciprocal rewarding."

Their contributions are usually at or slightly above the group average, but not maximally altruistic in a stable way. At multiple points they contribute their full endowment, indicating a willingness to prioritize group welfare, yet they also choose mid-range contributions that preserve a comfortable private payoff. Contribution levels fluctuate in response to others’ visible behavior: when partners contribute more, the player sometimes increases to full contribution; when others contribute little or free-ride, the player reduces back toward a moderate level rather than persisting at a high sacrifice. They appear to value fairness and mutual effort but not at any cost; they do not push a strict “always equal or above others” rule, nor do they clearly condition contributions on any one individual’s behavior. They tolerate some free-riding and asymmetry without sharp withdrawal. Risk tolerance seems moderate: they repeatedly risk being the highest contributor in the group, but they do not lock into that stance when it is not reciprocated.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nunknown (no chat content is provided, so tone, persuasion attempts, and direct coordination behavior are not observable).\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey never use the punishment option, even when others contribute substantially less or free-ride completely, and even though punishment is highly effective (large deductions for small cost). This indicates a strong reluctance to engage in costly negative sanctions. There is no evidence of reactive or retaliatory impulses toward low contributors or toward anyone who affects their relative payoff. They appear to prioritize keeping their own payoff and avoiding conflict over enforcing norms through harm. Whether this is driven by efficiency concerns (avoiding wasteful punishment) or by dislike of antagonism is unknown, but behaviorally they function as a non-punisher who tolerates deviations without imposing deterrence.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nThey are never punished by others, so their reaction to being targeted is unknown. There is no observable retaliation, compliance shift, or appeasement because they receive no negative sanctions.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey never reward anyone, including occasions where others contribute more than them or where a partner repeatedly benefits them via prosocial choices. Given that rewarding is payoff-neutral in this design (cost equals benefit), their refusal to use it suggests they do not adopt an active reinforcement strategy. They rely instead on passive adjustment of their own contributions, rather than using rewards to shape others’ behavior or signal gratitude. There is no sign that they attempt to form alliances via rewards or to encourage high cooperators with positive incentives.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThey receive small rewards multiple times from another player but do not reciprocate with rewards or visibly change their contribution pattern in a way tailored to that rewarder. Their cooperation level remains generally pro-social but not specifically responsive. This indicates low propensity for direct reciprocity via the reward mechanism and little interest in building dyadic exchange relationships. They also do not escalate their contributions beyond what they already do as a general cooperative baseline. Overall, they accept rewards passively without using them as a cue for special treatment.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey observe clear differences in others’ contributions, payoffs, and the presence of punishment events between other players, yet they maintain a calm, non-interventionist stance. They neither protect punished players nor join in sanctioning them, and they do not adjust contributions sharply in response to others’ gains or losses. When others benefit more than them, they do not exhibit envy-driven reduction in cooperation. When others are punished, they do not move to exploit the weakened player or compensate them. Their adjustments in contribution levels seem broadly responsive to the overall cooperation climate rather than to specific payoff shocks or sanction patterns. This suggests a player who monitors the environment but avoids direct involvement in sanction dynamics, and who maintains a baseline cooperative identity irrespective of local payoff inequalities or conflict among others."

They rarely match the highest contributor and rarely free-ride; instead they choose contributions in the mid-to-high range relative to the endowment. Their behavior suggests a preference for cooperative efficiency, but not at any cost: they sometimes reduce contributions when others lower theirs, and sometimes increase contributions when others’ cooperation rises. This pattern indicates conditional cooperation anchored around a “fair share” norm (roughly splitting the endowment between self and group, with occasional more generous moves). They tolerate some inequality and under-contribution by others without withdrawing cooperation entirely, implying moderate rather than extreme sensitivity to fairness violations. There is no sharp end-game drop; their final contributions remain non-zero and non-minimal, indicating they do not strongly pivot to pure payoff maximization even near the end. Overall, they appear as a pro-social conditional cooperator with bounded generosity and mild risk tolerance regarding being exploited by lower contributors.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nunknown (no chat content is provided in the transcript).\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey never use punishment despite multiple opportunities, even when another player clearly contributes much less or targets them with costly sanctions. This indicates a strong reluctance to spend resources on harming others, even when it could be justified by standard fairness norms or serve as deterrence. Their non-use of punishment persists across contexts with both mild and severe free-riding and after they themselves are punished, suggesting that retaliation is not a driving motive. They appear to prioritize conserving their own payoff and/or avoiding aggressive actions over enforcing norms through negative sanctions. This strongly points to a non-punitive, non-retaliatory type who accepts some exploitation rather than escalating conflict.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nWhen another player punishes them, they do not respond with counter-punishment at any later opportunity. Their contributions after being punished vary but do not show a clear compliance pattern directed specifically at the punisher (they continue to contribute at moderately high levels in general, not obviously favoring or targeting anyone). They also do not visibly reduce their cooperation in apparent spite. This suggests they are non-confrontational and absorb punishment without overt revenge. Whether they interpret punishment as informative feedback, as random hostility, or simply ignore it is uncertain, but behaviorally they show forgiveness or at least non-escalation. They maintain their broader cooperative stance rather than shifting into a defensive or vindictive strategy.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey never use rewards, even in situations where others contribute more than them or sustain high cooperation. Given that rewards are cost-neutral in immediate effect but can serve as positive reinforcement, their non-use indicates either a general preference not to engage with sanctioning mechanisms, a belief that rewards are unnecessary or ineffective, or a desire to keep decisions simple and self-focused. They do not selectively recognize or support the highest contributors through rewards, so they are not an “active norm enforcer” via positive incentives. Their pro-sociality is expressed mainly through their own contribution choices rather than through meta-level incentives.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nunknown (they are never rewarded in this game).\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey observe others’ contributions, payoffs, and the occasional use of punishment and reward, yet they do not adopt these tools themselves nor do they sharply mimic others’ payoff-maximizing behavior. When others defect more heavily or earn higher payoffs by contributing less, they do not collapse to minimal contribution, only moderating their level somewhat. When others increase their cooperation and gain strong payoffs, they respond with generally high contributions but do not differentially reinforce anyone via reward. They also do not appear to adjust behavior specifically to avoid future punishment, as their contribution pattern remains generally similar before and after being targeted. Overall, they seem to track the cooperative climate and adjust moderately, but they are relatively insensitive to others’ use of sanctions and to short-term payoff comparisons, maintaining a stable, moderately cooperative identity rather than chasing relative advantage."

At the same time, they repeatedly return to full contribution, indicating that they value group efficiency and do not settle into persistent defection even after being punished. Their pattern suggests a mix of norm compliance and opportunism: they appear to treat full contribution as the default “right” behavior but occasionally test or exploit the environment by defecting when they may feel safe or uncertain about others. Risk tolerance appears moderate: they are willing to risk punishment and social sanctions by defecting, but they also invest in costly punishment to uphold norms, which is itself risky in payoff terms.

Their “communication” is entirely through contribution and sanction decisions, which function as implicit signals. Through these, they signal strong disapproval of non‑contributors and acceptance of full contributors but do not explicitly reward good behavior.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThey remain fully cooperative at the end of the game and do not show a decay in contribution in the final period. There is no sign of an end‑game defection spike; instead, they align with the group’s high-contribution norm right through the last round. They also stop using punishment when the group is fully cooperative, showing that they track current conditions and do not use sanctions gratuitously at the horizon. Their horizon awareness is evident in that they have full information about remaining rounds, yet they still maintain cooperation at the end, consistent with either a preference for sustaining norms regardless of horizon or a belief that maintaining a cooperative reputation matters even when there is no future interaction in this specific game (true underlying motive remains uncertain).\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey are an active, selective norm enforcer who uses costly punishment against clear free‑riders but does not employ antisocial punishment. They only target players who contribute nothing when most others are contributing fully, suggesting a focus on enforcing a simple norm: everyone should contribute fully. They do not punish cooperators, and they do not respond with retaliation against apparent punishers; their sanctions always match visible contribution deviations rather than their own payoff changes. They are willing to punish even when it is individually costly and when the offender later cooperates again, indicating a deterrence or retributive motive more than strategic payoff maximization. They also expand punishment to new defectors as they appear, suggesting attention to the entire group’s behavior rather than fixating on a single offender. They cease punishing once full cooperation is restored, consistent with instrumental norm enforcement rather than spite. Overall, they behave like a prosocial, third-party enforcer of contribution norms who tolerates some personal cost to sustain cooperation but also occasionally defects themselves, implying some inconsistency between their own behavior and the standard they enforce.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey never use the reward mechanism, despite frequent opportunities and repeated high contributions from almost all others. This indicates a strong asymmetry between negative and positive sanctions: they rely on punishment, not reward, to shape behavior. Possible interpretations include a belief that contribution is merely expected and not something to be positively reinforced, or an efficiency-minded preference to spend resources only on high-impact punishments rather than low-leverage rewards. It is also possible they regard the reward tool as unnecessary when a high-contribution norm is already in place. Their lack of reward use persists even when players who previously defected move to full cooperation, suggesting little inclination toward gratitude signaling or rehabilitative reinforcement; once behavior meets the norm, they simply withhold both punishment and reward."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a mostly-cooperative but strategically inconsistent contributor who alternates between full cooperation and full defection. They use only the extreme options available rather than intermediate strategies (when constrained to 0 vs 20, they choose one or the other rather than mixing over time in a stable pattern). Their behavior shows that they are not a pure free-rider: they are willing to forgo private payoff and contribute fully to the public good in most rounds. At the same time, they sometimes free-ride even when others are consistently cooperative, indicating that maximizing personal payoff remains an important motive.\n\nTheir contribution pattern suggests conditionality, but in a non-straightforward way. They do not simply match others’ cooperation; they defect at times when others appear highly cooperative and cooperate even when some others defect. This implies that they are not a naive conditional cooperator who just “follows the crowd.” Instead, they appear to be experimenting with when to free-ride and when to contribute, possibly testing how much they can exploit group cooperation while still maintaining overall gains and/or group stability. The alternation between cooperation and defection suggests they are consciously balancing self-interest and some concern for collective outcomes, rather than committing to one extreme.\n\nIn terms of fairness norms, they seem to tolerate substantial inequality and personal disadvantage without visible adjustment in punishment or reward. Being heavily targeted by others (as implied by large deductions in some cooperative-context defections) does not lead them to retaliate via the sanctioning mechanism or to permanently switch into purely cooperative or purely selfish behavior. This resilience hints at either low concern for procedural fairness (they accept being sanctioned as a consequence of defection) or a pragmatic focus on outcomes rather than emotional responses to being treated harshly.\n\nOverall, they show moderate risk tolerance: they are willing to defect even when the environment is highly cooperative and punishment is powerful, which is strategically risky. Yet they also repeatedly choose full contribution when defection would be individually profitable, showing a willingness to bear short-term cost to participate in the group production process. Their type is best described as a “payoff-conscious, experimenting cooperator” rather than a firm altruist or a strict egoist.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nUnknown. There is no visible chat content or evidence of messages sent or received in the transcript. As a result, their tone, use of persuasion, responsiveness to others’ verbal cues, and coordination attempts through communication are all unknown. Their engagement style in chat (whether proactive, reactive, or silent) cannot be inferred.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThe player does not exhibit a classic end-game collapse of cooperation. Their final-round behavior remains fully cooperative, even though the horizon is known and there is no future opportunity for reciprocity. They neither escalate defection at the end nor switch into aggressive sanctioning. This suggests that their cooperative choices are not purely driven by future-oriented strategic reciprocity; they are at least partially willing to cooperate in “last chance” settings.\n\nTheir contribution pattern does not trend monotonically downward as the game progresses; instead, they oscillate. The final action is pro-social, implying that they do not treat the last round as an automatic opportunity for exploitation, even after having previously experienced costly punishment. This can indicate either a stable underlying tendency to value cooperation for its own sake, or a belief that maintaining a cooperative stance is intrinsically preferable, irrespective of the game’s imminent termination. Their horizon awareness is known (the interface shows remaining rounds), but any explicit reasoning about the end-game (e.g., sophisticated backward induction) is unknown.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey never use the punishment option, despite multiple opportunities and despite being targeted with substantial punishment themselves. This strongly suggests a non-punitive stance. They appear unwilling to spend personal resources to penalize others, even when some peers clearly defect relative to the cooperative norm and when they themselves suffer large deductions that might motivate retaliation.\n\nThis consistent abstention implies that deterrence is not a strategy they employ: they do not attempt to shape others’ behavior with sanctions, nor do they engage in revenge. Their restraint holds both when others are highly cooperative and when some players defect, indicating that they either (a) do not see punishment as cost-effective, (b) morally or emotionally dislike harming others, or (c) prioritize preserving their own payoff without incurring punishment costs. Which of these motives dominates is unknown, but the observable trait is: they are a non-punisher, even under strong provocation and with high punishment effectiveness available.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey never use the reward option, even in environments with strong group cooperation where many others contribute fully. They do not spend resources to positively reinforce cooperative behavior or to express gratitude through the formal mechanism. This indicates that they are not a strategic rewarder and do not invest in building or signaling reciprocity via costly rewards.\n\nGiven that rewards here are exactly cost-equal to the amount transferred, using them does not increase total group surplus and only redistributes between players. Their non-use is consistent with a payoff-preserving stance: they keep their own coins rather than reallocate them, even to highly cooperative partners. It may also indicate a preference for “silent cooperation” over explicit social reinforcement. They rely on their own contribution decisions, not on incentivizing others through material rewards."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a mostly cooperative, mildly opportunistic contributor. They usually choose the fully cooperative option when group cooperation appears strong and stable. Their default is to match or support a high-cooperation environment rather than free ride on it. However, they are not a pure unconditional cooperator: when there is visible defection by others and the cooperative norm looks less secure, they are willing to withhold contribution at least once. This shift indicates conditional cooperation with some tolerance for exploiting a perceived breakdown in norms.\n\nThey do not experiment with mixed or intermediate strategies (where available) and instead treat contribution as a binary norm decision: either fully join the cooperative majority or fully opt out. Their behavior suggests moderate risk tolerance in early and mid game, as they continue to contribute fully despite observing at least one clear defector and no guaranteed individual-level enforcement. At the same time, they are sensitive to fairness: once multiple group members defect and the cooperative standard feels less universal, they temporarily switch to free riding.\n\nOverall, their contribution pattern fits a “norm-first, but not self-sacrificial” type: they want the efficient cooperative outcome when others are on board, yet they are prepared to deviate if they perceive that others are undermining that norm.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nunknown. There is no observable chat content or turn-taking in communication in the transcript, so their tone, persuasion style, and responsiveness to others’ messages cannot be inferred.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThis player shows clear awareness of the game horizon and treats the final stage differently from the immediate prior period. After testing or exploiting a lapse in cooperation shortly before the end, they revert to full cooperation at the final opportunity when everyone else is also cooperating. This pattern is inconsistent with a pure backward-induction “defect at the end” logic and is more consistent with either norm-maintenance or payoff-salience at the final stage.\n\nThey appear responsive to the current social environment in the end game: seeing universal or near-universal cooperation, they align with it instead of taking a last-moment free-ride. This suggests that, near the end, their behavior is shaped more by a desire to conform to an established cooperative standard and secure the efficient outcome than by a short-term temptation to defect. Their cooperation does not decay as the end approaches; if anything, it recovers after a brief deviation, indicating either learning from negative feedback or a deliberate choice to leave on a cooperative footing.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey never use the punishment mechanism, despite at least some opportunities where punishing low contributors might be a straightforward norm-enforcing response. This strongly indicates a reluctance to spend their own resources to sanction others, even when punishment is highly cost-effective in terms of imposed loss versus personal cost.\n\nTheir non-use of punishment occurs even when they themselves are targeted by punishment from others. They do not retaliate or engage in second-order punishment, suggesting they are either indifferent to such sanctions, strategically focused on preserving their own payoff, or unwilling to escalate conflict. Their behavior fits a “non-punishing conditional cooperator”: they adjust their own contributions in response to others’ behavior instead of using the formal sanctioning tools to deter or correct defection.\n\nTheir motives for avoiding punishment could be efficiency-oriented (avoid wasteful costs), conflict-averse, or simply indifferent to enforcement; the transcript does not allow distinguishing these, so this is unknown.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey never use the reward mechanism, even in periods of strong cooperation where rewarding could reinforce prosocial behavior. Given that rewarding is cost-neutral in expectation (one coin spent to give one coin), their abstention suggests they are unwilling to spend any resources, even break-even, to shape others’ incentives or to express gratitude.\n\nThis pattern implies a strictly self-payoff-focused approach to the sanctioning stage: they rely on their own contributions as their cooperative signal and do not engage in explicit positive reinforcement of others. They appear to treat high contributions by others as expected behavior rather than something to be actively rewarded.\n\nOverall, they resemble a “quiet conditional cooperator” who supports cooperation mainly through their own contribution choices and adapts those choices based on the group’s behavior, while systematically abstaining from both punishment and reward tools."

Their contributions are not random; they appear conditional on perceived fairness and possibly on whether low contributors adjust their behavior. When the group is largely cooperative, they are willing to continue contributing fully. However, they are not a rigid altruist: they are willing to withhold contribution at least once when norms of full cooperation appear less secure, indicating moderate sensitivity to free-riding and some willingness to exploit an opportunity when others also defect. Their pattern suggests a preference for near-universal cooperation, but not at any personal cost and not unconditionally. Risk tolerance is moderate: they are willing to repeatedly invest in the public good despite the risk of others free-riding, but they also show that they can switch to self-interest when cooperative norms look fragile. Fairness norms appear important: they expect full or near-full contributions from everyone and adjust their behavior when this is violated.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nUnknown. There is no chat content in the transcript, so their tone, persuasion attempts, and responsiveness in communication are not observable. It is therefore unknown whether they try to coordinate, explain punishments, or influence others verbally.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThey demonstrate horizon awareness in the sense that they do not slide into a classic end-game collapse. In the final stage, once full cooperation is reestablished, they return to full contribution rather than exploiting the last opportunity to free-ride. This suggests that they value maintaining cooperative norms and/or maximizing group efficiency even at the end, provided others are also cooperating. There is no evidence of escalating punishment or last-round opportunism. Their strategy near the end appears more norm-following than strictly backward-induction-based, and they seem satisfied to finish in a fully cooperative state once defectors have conformed.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey are willing to use costly punishment and do so selectively against identifiable free-riders. They do not punish when everyone cooperates. When a specific player deviates by contributing nothing in an otherwise cooperative environment, they impose a single punishment unit, which is strong relative to its cost given the punishment technology, indicating a readiness to enforce norms even at significant personal expense. When a previously punished or low-contributing player later cooperates, they do not continue to punish, which suggests their motive is deterrence and norm enforcement rather than hostility or spite. They do not appear to use punishment opportunistically or for profit (since the mechanism is not profitable), only as a response to under-contribution. Their threshold for punishing seems tied to clear deviation from the apparent full-contribution norm; milder deviations or ambiguous cases do not appear in the transcript, so their response to those is unknown. They also tolerate being punished themselves at one point without any clear retaliatory punishment against others, suggesting they are not strongly revenge-oriented, or at least that they do not automatically respond to being punished with counter-punishment.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey never use the reward option, despite it being available every round. Given that several others consistently contribute fully, their lack of rewarding suggests one or more of the following beliefs or preferences: (a) they see cooperation as the expected baseline and not something that merits explicit positive reinforcement; (b) they view the reward mechanism as inefficient, since it is one-to-one in cost/benefit and thus does not leverage the strong externalities that punishment does; or (c) they prioritize conserving their own payoff over costly encouragement of already cooperative behavior. In any case, their strategic toolkit is one-sided: they rely on punishment to shape behavior, not rewards. They do not appear to use reward to signal gratitude, build alliances, or stabilize cooperation once it is achieved."

They begin with a moderate contribution that sits between full free-riding and full cooperation and then move to full cooperation. This pattern suggests they are generally willing to support the public good and do not anchor on pure self-interest. The increase in contribution is consistent with positive conditional cooperation: they appear to respond to the relatively high cooperative environment by raising their own contribution, rather than exploiting it. They are not rigidly fixed to one level; instead, they adjust upward when others’ behavior indicates strong group-oriented norms. They show willingness to sacrifice private payoff for group benefit and appear comfortable bearing some risk that others might not match their cooperation. Their behavior suggests a concern for being at least in line with, and at times above, the perceived norm of contribution, but there is insufficient evidence to conclude specific fairness rules (e.g., exact matching to others); they simply lean clearly toward the cooperative side.

They overwhelmingly choose to contribute fully to the public good even when others partially shirk, and they do not appear to condition their own contributions strongly on others’ deviations. The one deliberate zero contribution early on coincides with many others still giving; their own payoff then is strictly higher, so they do demonstrate understanding (or at least experience) that free-riding is lucrative. However, they immediately return to full contributions and maintain them for essentially the entire game, including in late rounds when group contributions wobble and when the marginal incentive to defect is especially strong. Their pattern suggests they prioritize maintaining group cooperation and stable earnings over exploiting occasional defection.\n\nTheir contributions are stable rather than volatile: apart from the single early zero and a period where others mistakenly perceive them as non-contributing despite them continuing to give, there is no oscillation between 0 and 20. They do not appear to retaliate against low contributors; they keep contributing even when specific others repeatedly give nothing, indicating a tolerance for inequity or a belief that maintaining the norm is more important than punishing defectors. They also do not appear to strategically time any end-game defection, instead continuing to cooperate when the game is close to ending (from the experimenter’s perspective), suggesting either limited strategic end-game calculation, an intrinsic cooperative preference, or a heuristic of “just keep contributing” once a norm is established.\n\nIncentive-wise, they seem motivated by a mix of money and social cohesion but lean towards sustaining cooperation: they join and support a high-contribution equilibrium and stick with it, likely recognizing that their own long-run earnings are better when the group stays cooperative. Their risk tolerance in the social sense is moderate: they are willing to risk being exploited by a few defectors to preserve the cooperative climate, rather than switching to pure self-protection. Fairness norms are present but not aggressively enforced; they do not initiate blame or pressure when others call them a “freeloader” in error and instead quietly keep cooperating, implying they value outcome fairness but are not driven to correct every misperception. Overall, their type is “loyal cooperator with mild early experimentation and low reactivity.”\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThey communicate sparingly compared to the more vocal players, and mostly in a light, affiliative tone rather than as a strategist or moralizer. They acknowledge positive group outcomes and shared identity, and they readily respond when directly addressed or when a social prompt invites personal information (such as location or dinner status). They do not take the lead in coordination: they neither propose explicit contribution strategies nor enforce norms with scolding or persuasion. Instead, they follow existing cooperative norms established by others and occasionally signal alignment (for example, affirming they are human when that becomes a topic, or confirming their region when others share theirs).\n\nWhen they are absent for a brief period and others incorrectly accuse them of not contributing, they do not defend themselves point-by-point or challenge the accusation; later, they simply state that they are “back on it” and implicitly recommit to the cooperative effort. This indicates a low-conflict, harmony-preserving style: they avoid confrontation, accept that misunderstandings occur, and focus on rejoining the group action rather than correcting reputational detail. Their engagement is responsive rather than initiatory: they answer questions and join small talk but do not redirect conversation or use chat to manipulate others’ contribution decisions.\n\nThey show no clear attempts at persuasion or sanctioning through language; they neither shame defectors nor appeal to collective earnings in a calculated way. Their beliefs about others appear trustful and group-oriented—there is no expressed suspicion or cynicism about others’ motives. Stylistically, they are sociable but not dominant, cooperative but not preachy, and they adapt by quietly matching the cooperative climate rather than actively shaping it."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a “committed conditional cooperator with one brief experimental deviation.” They overwhelmingly contribute the maximum possible amount and do so from the start without hesitation. Their pattern is highly stable: nearly every round they give the full endowment, indicating that they treat “maxing” as the default norm, not something to be bargained over each time. There is a single conspicuous low contribution where they choose the absolute minimum; this looks more like a one-off experiment or momentary defection than a change in long‑run strategy, because they immediately revert to full contributions afterward and sustain that to the end.\n\nTheir contributions are not mechanically unconditional: they closely observe others’ behavior, explicitly comment on whether “we” keep giving to the pot, and voice a belief that the game may react to contribution levels. Nonetheless, they continue to cooperate even when some others free‑ride, suggesting relatively high tolerance for exploitation and a prioritization of the group’s total earnings over personal, short‑term advantage.\n\nThey display an intuitive understanding that the game is very favorable to contribution, and their actual behavior aligns with that: they do not try to fine‑tune contributions based on marginal fluctuations in others’ giving; instead, they stick to a simple, payoff‑maximizing rule of “always (or almost always) max.” Fairness norms appear to be present but not rigidly enforced through their own actions. They do not directly retaliate against specific low contributors via their contribution choices; rather than conditionally reducing their own contributions to punish others, they maintain high contributions to preserve the collective payoff stream.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nTheir tone is light, playful, and socially oriented. They use casual slang, jokes, and off‑topic chatter (about bank bonuses, pets, and payouts) more than task‑focused exhortations. When they do talk about the game mechanics, they do it briefly and in a quasi‑philosophical or meta way (e.g., talking about “playing the game” or speculating about when it ends) rather than arguing detailed strategy.\n\nThey attempt mild coordination but not in a directive style. They initially ask clarifying questions about payoffs and whether maxing out is optimal, then quickly align with the emerging “max” consensus. Later, they float ideas like everyone contributing a minimal amount “out of spite,” but do not follow through themselves, indicating that these suggestions are more rhetorical than genuine attempts at re‑coordination. They seem comfortable engaging in group banter and responding to others’ jokes, including leaning into an in‑joke about the “green bird.”\n\nThey respond to being discussed (as “green bird”) not with defensiveness but by joking along and re‑entering the social flow, which points to relatively thick skin and a social, affiliative style. They provide some informational content (survey income, browser extension, bonus mechanics), suggesting they like to be helpful and knowledgeable in the group.\n\nThey are moderately responsive: they react to the ongoing conversation, adjust topics (from payoffs to survey earnings to payment mechanisms), and occasionally answer or riff on others’ statements. However, they rarely address specific individuals’ strategic misbehavior directly; their communication is broad and group‑oriented rather than confrontational. Overall, they engage rather than withdraw, and they contribute to a playful, cooperative group culture.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThis player clearly tracks group outcomes and others’ contributions. They comment on how much everyone is earning per round and how that depends on collective giving. They show awareness that when some players contribute less, the shared payoff decreases for all, and they echo or reinforce the idea that “easy money” is available if people simply keep contributing.\n\nTheir emotional response to others’ free‑riding is restrained and indirect. While other players use insults or strong language toward low contributors, this player does not join in that hostility. When they mention “doing us dirty” or discuss stopping contributions, it is framed in a joking or speculative way rather than as angry condemnation. They seem more interested in understanding or predicting system‑level behavior (e.g., whether the game ends if contributions drop) than in morally judging individual defectors.\n\nDespite being aware of exploitation, they do not shift into a punitive contribution strategy. Even after observing several low contributors and declining group averages, they revert to and maintain maximum contributions. This indicates a preference for maintaining group earnings over engaging in mutual destruction through widespread defection. They show no evidence of using their own contributions as a targeted response to specific players’ payoffs; their one very low contribution aligns with a moment when many others also reduce, but they do not persist in that mode.\n\nOverall, the player interprets others’ outcomes mainly through the lens of collective opportunity: as long as enough people cooperate, everyone—including themselves—earns well. Their reactions are pragmatic and mildly humorous rather than vindictive, and they continue to support a high‑cooperation equilibrium even under some free‑riding."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a strongly pro-social, near-unconditional high contributor who anchors the group on full cooperation. They almost always give the maximum possible amount, with one notable deviation to a mid-level contribution when the group briefly unravels, after which they immediately revert to max-giving and stay there. Their default heuristic is that contributing fully is obviously optimal because the marginal return on a contributed coin is low if kept privately and high when pooled; they explicitly articulate that there is “no reason not” to give everything. They are not purely altruistic in the sense of sacrificing for fairness: they understand and accept that minimal contributors and free riders earn more in some rounds, but they still keep contributing fully because the absolute payoffs are high and stable when the group cooperates. This shows relatively high risk tolerance with respect to exploitation and a preference for maximizing group surplus and the “easy money” flow over tracking their relative advantage. Their contributions are only weakly conditional on others’ behavior: they complain, scold, and momentarily lower their own contribution at one point, yet they do not adopt a sustained retaliatory or tit-for-tat pattern. They tolerate persistent low contributors, including a repeatedly undergiving peer, without systematically lowering their own giving in response. They hold and promote an efficiency norm: the correct “game-theoretic” move, in their mind, is to keep everyone at the maximum to maximize the per-round surplus, even when some individuals behave “tightly.” Self-interest matters, but in the sense of maximizing expected earnings through stable cooperation rather than through exploiting others.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThe player is outspoken, initiative-taking, and uses chat as a primary tool to coordinate high cooperation and to enforce social norms. They greet the group, propose the cooperative strategy early, and continue to reinforce the “always max” norm throughout. Their tone is mostly casual and pragmatic, with some light humor, but periodically escalates into explicit profanity and direct insults toward perceived free riders or “tight” contributors. They use shaming language and moralizing (“acting like a dick,” “cant even think,” “fuck you,” “what a dick”) when frustrated by low contributions or perceived hypocrisy, signaling low tolerance for opportunism once norms are established. At the same time, they engage in side conversation about surveys, earnings, and working from home, indicating comfort with informal social interaction and not being solely focused on the game. They use simple economic reasoning about payoff structure in their persuasion: they stress that the per-coin return is poor privately, that the small private endowment is trivial, and that maximizing contributions generates a large, reliable bonus. They reference “game theory” to frame the behavior normatively, suggesting they see themselves as rational and analytically minded, and they expect others to think in such terms as well. They respond to others’ questions and comments, reinforcing coordination statements from cooperative peers and answering about payment structure and bonuses. Overall, they are engaged, reactive, and often take a leadership/cheerleading role in pushing for maximum cooperation, but they express irritation openly when others deviate.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThe player tracks others’ contribution behavior and group-level outcomes quite closely and interprets them through a fairness and efficiency lens. They notice when particular individuals contribute less than the group and repeatedly refer to these as “tight” or “fuckers,” indicating a negative moral and emotional reaction to unequal burdens, even though they do not directly adjust their own contributions in a systematic punitive pattern. They understand that low contributors can earn more individually while others keep maxing and call this out explicitly, showing that they are not naïve about free riding. Yet their primary concern appears to be the erosion of trust and the risk that others will stop contributing, which would collapse the high-bonus regime; they warn that if “trust is lost,” payoffs will drop towards the trivial baseline. They thus interpret outcome trends (declining average returns when contributions fall) as evidence of harmful greed and use those observations to scold deviants and to re-motivate cooperators. They do not have access to direct punishment or reward tools in this game, so their main “sanction” response is verbal: shaming, labeling, and trying to reframe defection as short-sighted or stupid. They are aware that non-contributors or minimal contributors sometimes end up with higher round payoffs and they sarcastically frame such players as thinking they are “clever,” but rather than imitating them, they double down on the call for everyone to keep giving. Their adaptation is thus primarily in rhetoric, not in their own contribution strategy: they continue to give highly even in the presence of exploitation, with only a brief, isolated drop, and focus on steering the social narrative back toward “easy money for all” through mutual cooperation."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is best described as a “principled high-contributor with one experiment in free-riding.” They almost always contribute the full endowment, showing a strong and persistent preference for group-efficient outcomes over individual short-term gain. Their contributions are highly stable across the game: they continue to give the maximum even when others start lowering their contributions, and even when the group briefly coordinates around cynical or retaliatory strategies. There is a single clear deviation where they sharply reduce their contribution while many others also experiment with lower amounts; this looks more like a one-off test or momentary alignment with the group mood than a shift in their basic strategy, because they immediately revert to maximal giving and then maintain it.\n\nTheir behavior is conditional only in a very weak sense: they do not appear to condition their contributions strongly on observed defection by others. Instead, they act as if contributing the maximum is “the right play” almost regardless of others’ behavior. They repeatedly frame the small private endowment as nearly worthless compared to the redistributed payoff, indicating an internal fairness/efficiency heuristic: maximizing the public good is seen as obviously rational for everyone, and keeping coins is treated as both irrational and self-defeating in the long run.\n\nThey seem relatively risk-tolerant in a social sense: they continue to cooperate even as some players lower contributions, accepting the risk of being exploited in order to preserve a high-payoff norm. They do not hedge by giving intermediate amounts; their pattern is essentially “all-in cooperation” with one brief low-contribution outlier. They also appear focused on expected monetary value rather than narrow fairness of shares: they tolerate that low contributors sometimes earn more in a given round if they believe that maintaining high contributions keeps absolute payoffs large for themselves as well.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nTheir tone is concise, pragmatic, and generally cooperative, with occasional light informality. They participate in early social bonding but quickly shift toward commenting on payoffs, effective hourly earnings, and the benefit of sustained cooperation. They explicitly encourage others to maintain high contributions, using simple cost–benefit arguments: the per-round bonus is framed as “easy money,” the private endowment as trivial. They repeatedly remind the group that reducing contributions will sharply reduce everyone’s income, and they emphasize that the value of the shared pot far exceeds the small, forgone 20-coin endowment.\n\nThey attempt mild persuasion rather than confrontation. When criticized by others (who misattribute low contributions to “green bird”), they do not retaliate or argue about blame; instead, they restate the efficiency logic and urge continued max contributions. Their arguments focus on long-run group outcomes rather than moral condemnation. They also give meta-comments about the game’s duration and earnings, which signals attention to the experimental context and incentive structure.\n\nThey engage playfully at times (joining in on joking or off-topic chat), which suggests they are socially comfortable and not purely instrumental. However, their core use of communication is to reinforce a cooperative norm and reorient others away from short-term free-riding. They explicitly advise ignoring those proposing zero-contribution strategies, signaling an intent to stabilize expectations around full cooperation.\n\nResponsiveness is moderate: they react to the group’s strategic discussions (about donating zero, about round length, about survey payment structure) and tailor their comments to these concerns. They do not individually call out specific low contributors by name, which fits a preference for system-level persuasion rather than interpersonal conflict.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey clearly track group outcomes: they reference pay per round in real-money terms and explicitly note how lower contributions reduce everyone’s payoff. They interpret others’ defections primarily through an efficiency lens: low contributors are not just opportunistic; their behavior is described as self-harming in the long run because it undermines the high-earning equilibrium. Their repeated insistence that the private coins are nearly worthless relative to the redistributed pot shows that they benchmark behavior against aggregate earnings, not just relative standing.\n\nThey do not express direct anger or resentment toward low contributors, even when others in chat become insulting or adversarial. Instead, they use these moments as opportunities to restate that under-contributing “hurts them in the end” and that the rational response is to keep maxing out. This indicates a low inclination toward punitive or spiteful responses and a higher inclination toward didactic, efficiency-based reassurance.\n\nThey appear relatively insensitive to being personally misattributed as a low contributor (the “green bird” comments): there is no observable attempt to defend their reputation or correct the record. From their behavior, their primary response to others’ outcomes is to preserve the cooperative norm that sustains high payoffs, rather than to seek fairness in the distribution of gains or to protect their own image. They do not suggest reciprocal punishment strategies (e.g., “if others give 0, we should all give 0 back”); instead, they warn that such retaliation only collapses the pot and leaves everyone with minimal returns.\n\nOverall, they respond to others’ outcomes as a payoff-maximizing cooperators’ advocate: they see the public good level and per-round earnings as the key signals, and use communication and their own consistent contributions to nudge the group back toward the high-contribution equilibrium whenever it starts to wobble."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a highly stable high contributor who almost always gives the full endowment. Their default is to contribute the maximum available amount, and they maintain this pattern from the beginning through the end of the game. There is a single clear deviation to a lower (but still positive) contribution; it coincides with an explicit statement about intending to contribute nothing in a subsequent round and with a moment of visible group frustration and experimentation. Despite that declaration, they immediately revert back to full contributions in all following rounds, including when others around them reduce their own giving.\n\nTheir strategy appears primarily efficiency‑oriented rather than narrowly self‑interested: they consistently choose the option that, under this multiplier, maximizes joint returns. They do not seem to condition their contributions on the exact degree of cooperation of others; even when several group members start free‑riding or partially defecting, this player keeps giving the maximum instead of punishing by cutting their own contribution. This suggests weak conditional cooperation and a tendency toward “unconditional cooperator” behavior in practice.\n\nThey show some willingness to experiment strategically at one point when trust momentarily declines, but the experiment is minimal, very short‑lived, and they promptly return to the cooperative norm. They tolerate the risk of being exploited by low contributors in order to preserve high group earnings, indicating low aversion to being the “sucker” and relatively high risk tolerance in service of collective gains. Fairness concerns, if present, are subordinated to maintaining the high‑contribution equilibrium.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nTheir tone is light, somewhat ironic, and socially engaged rather than moralizing or confrontational. They join the initial social greetings, participate in off‑topic banter about bank switches and the meta‑nature of the experiment, and occasionally joke about another player likely being a bot. They do not attempt to lead or organize the group around contribution norms: they never lecture about the payoff structure, never scold low contributors, and do not push explicit coordination instructions.\n\nThey respond to others’ topics rather than initiating new strategic discussions themselves. When the chat drifts into non‑game topics (banks, surveys, PhDs), they chime in with brief, humorous, or acknowledging comments. When they talk about contribution strategy, they do so in a casually provocative way (e.g., announcing an intention to contribute nothing next round during a tense moment), which reads more like playing with the social dynamics than mounting a serious revolt. Their subsequent behavior contradicts that declaration, implying it is not a firm commitment but more of a performative or joking threat.\n\nThey are attentive to the game’s structure and practicalities: they ask about the number of rounds, publicly report their current cumulative payoff when others discuss totals, and acknowledge the conversion rule for the bonus. They answer direct informational prompts (e.g., confirming the bonus rate) but do not try to persuade others through detailed argument. Overall, they engage socially, maintain a playful tone, and avoid direct conflict or moral condemnation.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThis player observes others’ outcomes and contribution patterns but does not visibly retaliate or reward through their own contributions. When some group members free‑ride or give less, they continue to fully contribute, even though this reduces their relative advantage and makes them vulnerable to exploitation. They do not publicly complain about making less than low contributors, nor do they express resentment when those players earn higher round payoffs as a result of under‑contributing.\n\nTheir one noticeable behavioral deviation to a lower contribution aligns with a moment of collective frustration and talk of withholding contributions, but there is no sustained pattern of conditional response to specific individuals’ outcomes. After that brief dip, they remain cooperative even as fluctuations in others’ contributions continue. This suggests they place substantial weight on maintaining a cooperative environment and high total pot, and relatively little on punishing defectors via their own actions.\n\nIn chat, they occasionally frame others’ behavior jokingly (such as calling a persistently under‑contributing player a bot) but not in a way that escalates conflict or tries to enforce norms. They neither join the more aggressive name‑calling nor defend the low contributor. Their main visible response to seeing group earnings rise and fall is to keep doing what they know yields high payoffs collectively and to share their own cumulative payoff when asked. Overall, they behave as a robust cooperator who monitors outcomes but does not let inequities or short‑term exploitation strongly alter their own cooperative strategy."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a strongly pro‑cooperative, near-constant high contributor who treats “maxing” as the default strategy. They contribute the full endowment in essentially every round, with one clear deviation when they sharply reduce their contribution once, then immediately revert to full contributions afterward. That deviation appears as an experimental or emotional blip rather than a new long‑run strategy, given its singular nature and the immediate return to full giving.\n\nTheir baseline norm is: everyone should contribute the maximum, and they personally abide by it even when others free‑ride. They do not condition their contributions tightly on others’ recent behavior; they keep contributing fully through periods with noticeable under‑contributors and only once momentarily drop below full contribution despite repeated opportunities to defect profitably. This points to a “conditional in principle, but stubbornly cooperative in practice” type: they understand the exploitation risk but still prioritize maintaining the cooperative equilibrium.\n\nThey appear payoff‑aware and accept that high contribution is individually profitable in this parameter setting, yet their persistence when others under‑contribute indicates they are willing to sacrifice short‑term advantage to sustain group cooperation. Risk tolerance seems moderate: they tolerate the risk of being exploited by a few low contributors as long as the majority keeps cooperating, and they do not pre‑emptively defect when some defection shows up.\n\nThey show a nascent willingness to rethink the “always max” rule late in the game, discouraging maximal contributions once after repeated exploitation and mixed behavior from others. However, they do not act on this in their own choices beyond the single low‑contribution round, suggesting that their internal threshold for abandoning cooperation is high. Fairness norms are clearly strong: they want everyone to contribute equally and visibly dislike inequitable sharing, but they respond mainly through talk and social pressure rather than by systematically cutting their own contribution.\n\nOverall type: “Stubborn high cooperator with a brief, non‑sustained flirtation with defection.”\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThe player is verbally sparse but strategically active when they do speak. Their tone is concise, cooperative, and mildly corrective rather than angry. Early on, they explicitly align themselves with the group’s “max contribution” norm, endorsing the consensus when others promote it. As the game progresses, they occasionally step in to steer group norms: they oppose a suggestion that everyone contribute nothing, instead urging others to keep contributing maximally, and later they briefly reverse that stance, advising against continued maxing when exploitation and inconsistency have become salient.\n\nThey rarely initiate new topics; instead they respond to existing coordination discourse. Their messages focus almost entirely on contribution norms rather than off‑topic chatting or personal small talk. This indicates a task‑oriented, efficiency‑focused communication style: they speak when they think it affects group strategy, not to socialize.\n\nThey sometimes echo or reinforce pro‑cooperation messages from other high contributors, positioning themselves as part of the “responsible cooperators” subgroup that tries to keep the group on track. When they briefly advise against maxing, they do not justify it explicitly in words, but the timing coincides with increased free‑riding; their communications then reflect a more cautious or disillusioned stance, suggesting they are responsive to perceived norm erosion.\n\nThey do not join in personal attacks on low contributors and do not use insults; their one direct challenge (“or not”) to a proposal to all defect is minimal and dry rather than emotional. Altogether, they are a low‑volume, norm‑focused communicator who engages selectively for coordination and mild persuasion, avoids hostility, and adjusts their verbal advice as their assessment of the situation changes.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThis player clearly attends to others’ contributions and resulting outcomes and uses them to update their beliefs and recommendations, though they do not make large or sustained changes to their own contribution pattern. They see that some players consistently under‑contribute and still receive the same redistributed payoff, and they recognize the classical free‑rider problem: their comments and endorsements of “max” norms are attempts to protect the high‑payoff cooperative equilibrium despite visible exploitation.\n\nWhen chat participants complain about the “green bird” or other low contributors effectively earning more per coin by giving less, the focal player does not echo the hostility but does take it into account strategically: they oppose nihilistic suggestions to make everyone drop to zero, arguing implicitly that maintaining high contributions is still better, then later express the opposite norm (“no don’t put max”) once continued exploitation and inconsistency have accumulated. This sequence suggests they update their stance in light of the group’s observed behavior and aggregate payoffs, but do so cautiously and without consistent follow‑through in their own choices.\n\nThey show no evidence of envy over individuals temporarily earning more by contributing little; instead, their concern is about the stability of group cooperation and the overall payoff level. They do not celebrate or punish specific individuals, nor do they single out particular players by name. Their reactions are at the level of group norms rather than interpersonal scorekeeping.\n\nIn sum, they watch others’ contribution/payoff patterns, understand the incentive structure, and adjust their verbal recommendations to the group when they think the cooperative arrangement is at risk, but personally remain mostly locked into a high‑contribution pattern even in the face of exploitation."

They begin with a moderate contribution and then shift to full contributions once a “max” norm is discussed, suggesting they are conditionally cooperative but willing to lead with high contributions once they believe the group will follow. Their contributions are very stable: they give the maximum in all but one round, where they explicitly announce and execute a deviation to zero as a retaliatory or experimental response to another player’s persistent free-riding.\n\nTheir behavior shows a clear understanding of the payoff structure: they explicitly assert that contributing more yields a larger overall return and that holding back “doesn’t make sense” or leaves people worse off, and they reinforce the idea that one should end each decision with nothing kept. They exhibit relatively low risk aversion regarding others’ cooperation: they continue to fully contribute even while a known defector persists in low or zero contributions for many rounds. Only after extended frustration do they briefly abandon the cooperative norm, then immediately return to full contributions.\n\nThey strongly endorse a fairness norm that everyone should contribute the maximum each time; they judge deviators harshly, label them as greedy or bad at math, and at one point encourage a coordinated zero-contribution response as a form of social sanction. Their one-zero deviation appears strategic and expressive (to punish or test the suspected exploiter and/or see if others will follow) rather than a shift in long-term strategy. Overall, their type is a “principled cooperator with retaliatory impulse”: they default to collective efficiency and high giving, but are willing to momentarily defect to punish perceived exploitation or to demonstrate a point.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThe player is highly engaged in chat, reactive to others, and comfortable using humor and mild insults. Their tone mixes sarcasm and irritation with informational content. They align themselves with the cooperative majority and repeatedly reinforce the norm of maximal contributions, sometimes in very succinct, directive messages. They participate in coordination efforts by declaring their own intended contribution, echoing group norms, and endorsing simple rules of thumb (“max,” “0 once,” “you should be holding 0 when you’re done”).\n\nThey are particularly focused on the under-contributing “chicken” player. Early on, they join others in calling out that player’s low contributions, directly stating that the numbers observed contradict the claimed behavior, and they explicitly attribute the pattern to poor understanding, trolling, or being a plant/bot. Over time, their language toward this player becomes more openly negative (calling them greedy, bad at math, a troll) and they even ask the “researchers” to remove that player. They do, however, also provide concrete instructions on how to interact with the interface, indicating that they are not purely hostile; they are willing to help but quickly lose patience when the pattern persists.\n\nThey show responsiveness to group queries and information: they correct mistaken beliefs about the number of rounds, reference the stated time range for the session, and repeat or clarify the payoff logic for others. Their persuasion style is blunt rather than diplomatic: they use socially charged labels (e.g., greedy, trolling) as part of normative enforcement, and they explicitly lobby for a coordinated zero-contribution move as a collective punishment tactic when they feel exploited. They remain actively conversational until the end, continuing to comment on others’ behavior and to restate negative judgments about the persistent low contributor.\n\nPersonality-wise, they present as confident, norm-enforcing, and somewhat confrontational. They are socially engaged, prefer explicit coordination, and care about both efficiency and fairness, but they are quick to express contempt for those they perceive as knowingly exploiting the group. They do not withdraw from interaction; instead, they lean into engagement, using communication as a tool to enforce norms, signal their own strategy, and shape group behavior."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a generally high, near-max contributor with a few opportunistic deviations. After initially contributing below the emerging group norm, they quickly align with the dominant “contribute the maximum” convention and maintain that as their default. Their pattern suggests that once they grasp that high contribution is both expected and individually profitable given others’ behavior, they follow it reliably rather than experimenting much.\n\nThey are not perfectly unconditional: on two late occasions they contribute a moderate amount instead of the full maximum, coinciding with visible coordination breakdown and talk of switching to low contributions. These deviations are modest rather than extreme, which indicates a weak form of conditional cooperation: they are willing to shave contributions down a bit when others openly discuss defecting, but they do not push all the way to full free-riding. They also once contribute nothing while nearly everyone else contributes highly, which is inconsistent with their usual pattern and not directly justified in chat; this may reflect confusion, opportunism, or a one-off test of how payoffs respond to defection. Motivation for that specific move is unknown.\n\nAcross the game, they appear comfortable taking some individual risk early on (by matching the group’s proposed high-contribution norm) and then continue to accept that risk even in the presence of one persistent low contributor. They do not join efforts to punish the low contributor via coordinated defection, nor do they consistently follow such calls, suggesting a stronger attachment to maintaining high-payoff cooperation than to enforcing strict fairness via retaliation.\n\nThey appear payoff-sensitive: they experience and can observe that high contributions in this environment are individually lucrative, and their stable high-contribution pattern is consistent with “rational cooperation” rather than pure altruism. At the same time, their intermittent partial deviations show that fairness and norm-following are not absolute; they are willing to tilt slightly toward self-interest when norms become ambiguous or contested. Risk tolerance seems moderate: they are willing to depend on others’ cooperation for most of the game, but they hedge slightly near the end when defections are publicly discussed.\n\nOverall, this player fits a “mostly cooperative, lightly conditional contributor” type: they default to full cooperation when a strong norm is present and perceived payoffs are good, show only limited responsiveness to norm violations, and never adopt a fully exploitative or fully punitive stance.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThis player is quiet and low-initiative in chat, participating minimally and almost never steering the group’s strategy. Their tone is neutral and polite rather than emotional or confrontational. They introduce themselves briefly at the start and then largely observe the conversation, speaking only when they need clarification or when answering a direct informational question.\n\nThey openly ask others to confirm whether they are “doing it right,” which signals uncertainty about the mechanism or payoffs and a willingness to rely on the group for guidance rather than deriving the optimal strategy alone. This question appears after they have already been contributing highly, suggesting they may still feel unsure about the exact interface or payoff logic even while conforming to the apparent norm. Once other players respond and the cooperative norm is reinforced, they do not continue to press for details, indicating that basic reassurance is sufficient for them.\n\nThey participate in coordination only in a light, follow-the-leader way. When others propose contributing the maximum, they explicitly agree and then match the suggested behavior. When someone confused asks what to contribute, this player briefly echoes the group’s “max contribution” advice in simple terms, reinforcing the existing norm rather than proposing anything new. They do not join the more aggressive or mocking tone some players use toward the low contributor, nor do they attempt to defend or criticize anyone; their communication is non-punitive and non-confrontational.\n\nThey do not visibly try to persuade defectors to change, nor do they lobby for group-wide retaliation when someone free-rides. They appear more interested in understanding the “correct” way to play and quietly aligning with it than in managing others’ behavior. Their engagement style is low-conflict, low-ego, and deferential: they accept that others set the narrative of “20 is best,” adopt it, and then mostly stay silent, using chat only for minimal coordination and reassurance rather than social bonding or argument."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a mostly unconditional high contributor with a brief early defection and one isolated low-contribution outlier. They start by contributing well below the emerging group norm, taking advantage of others’ generosity while the environment is still being figured out. Immediately afterward, once a strong group norm of full contribution forms and is reinforced in chat, they switch to consistently contributing the maximum. This pattern holds almost the entire game, including after observing some others occasionally withholding or experimenting with zero. \n\nThe single very low contribution appears once, midgame, during a period when frustration and joking about free-riding are visible in chat. The player does not persist with this behavior; they quickly revert to full contributions thereafter. This suggests a momentary deviation (possibly opportunistic or experimental) rather than a stable strategy of exploitation or retaliation.\n\nOverall, they behave like a “norm-following high cooperator”: willing to cooperate fully as long as there is a visible cooperative majority, and not strongly conditional on the exact fairness of each other individual’s behavior. They do not systematically punish low contributors via their own contributions, even when given obvious opportunities to do so. They appear comfortable sustaining high cooperation even in the presence of a conspicuous freerider, treating that as noise rather than as a reason to unravel the public good.\n\nTheir contributions also indicate relatively low risk aversion with respect to group cooperation: they continue to invest fully even when a few others coordinate to temporarily defect and even near the end of the game, despite not knowing when the task will stop. They seem to prioritize the expected gain from the group multiplier over short-term private gains from holding back, and they do not try to time an “endgame collapse.”\n\nIn environments without punishment or reward options, this player’s default is to keep contributing at or near the maximum once a cooperative equilibrium is established. They show little inclination to lead a defection or to closely fine-tune contributions as a function of minor norm violations. If placed in a group that is mostly cooperative, they almost certainly continue to be a near-maximum contributor; if placed in a mostly non-cooperative group, their behavior is less clear (unknown), as there is no evidence of them facing a sustained low-cooperation environment.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThe player does not speak in the chat at any point. They are a completely silent participant, despite very active communication from others and multiple invitations to coordinate. This indicates an engagement style that is observant but non-verbal: they read and respond behaviorally to the group’s stated norms but choose not to participate in the social discourse.\n\nTheir non-participation means they neither cajole nor criticize others, avoid joking or moralizing, and do not publicly align with any faction (those supportive of the struggling player vs. those hostile, or the cooperators vs. would-be defectors). They let others handle norm enforcement and persuasion, and simply react at the decision screen.\n\nThis silence suggests a preference for low social visibility, low conflict, and perhaps a focus on the task’s payoff structure over social dynamics. Nevertheless, their actions track the cooperative narrative being developed in chat: once the group converges on “we should all put in the maximum,” they align their contributions accordingly and maintain that line, even when some others later try to organize a collective move to zero. They do not publicly resist these calls; they simply ignore them in their choices.\n\nIn new PGG environments, this player is best characterized as a quiet, behaviorally cooperative type: they listen, infer the prevailing cooperative standard from others’ contributions and messages, but refrain from active persuasion, leadership, or confrontation. Their influence on the group is purely via their consistent high contributions, not via communication."

They do not condition their own contributions on others’ behavior in any systematic way; there is no evidence of retaliation, strategic withholding, or “teaching” via contribution changes. Instead, they appear to treat their own contribution level as a fixed norm once they infer that full contribution is payoff-maximizing for the group.\n\nTheir comments show that they understand the structure of the game and believe that full contribution is individually rational when others also contribute, and they endorse the idea that non-contributors are being “stingy.” They show willingness to tolerate exploitation by a persistent low contributor rather than sacrifice their own cooperative standard. Even when a small coalition proposes mutual defection to punish the free-rider, they do not join and instead continue to give the maximum. This suggests low willingness to use contribution as a punitive or strategic lever and a relatively low appetite for payoff-destroying punishment even in the face of frustration. Risk tolerance appears moderate to high at the social level: they consistently “bet” on cooperation and maintain that bet even after evidence of opportunism. Their fairness norms emphasize what others “should” do (everyone contributing fully) more than matching others’ behavior; they express disapproval verbally but do not translate that into behavioral defection.

They clearly understand the cooperative logic of the game and explicitly endorse it, briefly encouraging full contributions and criticizing under-contributors as “stingy” or trolling. Their style mixes joking with mild exasperation: they make wry comments about others’ math skills and speculate that a problematic player may be a researcher plant or troll, but these remarks remain relatively light and not overtly hostile.\n\nThey participate in group-level norm-setting but are not a primary organizer of detailed coordination plans; they chime in to support full-contribution norms rather than propose complex strategies. When the group’s mood shifts from anger toward the problematic player to more playful or resigned banter, they adapt by using humor themselves. They also occasionally offer short supportive or approving messages when someone appears to cooperate in line with the group’s preference, suggesting a tendency to reinforce prosocial behavior socially rather than through contribution changes.\n\nThey do not appear to dominate the conversation; instead they interject periodically, react to others’ comments, and contribute to the shared narrative about who is cooperative and who might be trolling. Their responses to persistent norm violations are verbal (sarcastic comments, sighs, expressions of disbelief) rather than escalatory or coordinated sanction attempts. Overall, they are an engaged, cooperative communicator who uses brief, emotionally expressive remarks to signal norms, express mild frustration, and maintain group cohesion without pushing hard or taking a leadership role."

Their contributions are maximally stable and show no volatility or contingent response to free-riding, partial cooperation, or shifts in overall group contribution levels.\n\nThey follow a simple, fixed rule: fully invest in the public fund every time. This suggests they prioritize the social optimum or a strong internal norm over individual payoff maximization. They do not appear to condition on fairness (others contributing less does not reduce their own contributions, and spikes in group cooperation do not increase them because they are already at the maximum). There is no evidence that they try to match, punish, reward, or strategically respond to particular peers’ patterns.\n\nGiven that the marginal per capita return is above 1 for the group but below 1 individually, this unwavering full contribution implies high tolerance for exploitation risk. They are willing to be taken advantage of by low contributors, at least within the confines of the game, and do not hedge or “test” the group. They behave as if the correct or expected thing is to cooperate fully, independent of short-term personal incentives.\n\nTheir behavior is consistent with a strong, possibly unconditional prosocial or rule-following orientation: once they understand that contributions benefit the group, they lock into the cooperative option and do not deviate. There is no observed learning curve or strategic experimentation; if learning happens, it is completed before or immediately at the start of observed play.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThe player shows no visible end-game effect. Their strategy remains unchanged when the game is near completion: they keep contributing fully even when the remaining number of rounds is small and when many others either maintain cooperative behavior or drop/oscillate. There is no sign of the typical cooperation decay, last-round defection, or even a mild reduction in contributions as the horizon approaches.\n\nThis suggests that they either do not factor the finite horizon into their strategy, or they choose to ignore it in favor of a fixed cooperation norm. They act as if the time horizon is irrelevant to what they “should” do. If they reason about the end-game, they still prefer to maintain a consistent cooperative identity rather than exploit the final rounds.\n\nOverall, they appear to be a time-invariant, principle-driven cooperator whose behavior is not strategically altered by approaching termination."

When facing a one-shot or unknown-horizon public goods setting, they allocate their entire endowment to the public fund rather than keeping any for themselves. This indicates a strong cooperative or pro-social orientation that does not appear to be hedged by self-protective caution in this instance.\n\nTheir contribution pattern is maximally generous within the game’s constraints and aligns with a belief (implicit or explicit) that collective investment is desirable, even when no direct mechanisms for punishment or reward are available. They treat the decision as if mutual high cooperation is either likely enough or normatively correct enough to justify foregoing private payoff.\n\nBecause only a single decision is observed, stability across rounds and sensitivity to others’ behavior are unknown. It is unclear whether they would maintain full cooperation if others contributed less, or if they would adjust in future rounds based on exploitation concerns. There is no direct evidence of conditional cooperation thresholds, tit-for-tat tendencies, or decay in contributions; these are therefore unknown.\n\nTheir choice suggests relatively low risk aversion with respect to being exploited by free-riders in this instance, or alternatively, a strong preference for acting in line with a cooperative norm regardless of exploitation risk. Given that they choose the most generous feasible action even in a setting without punishment, without communication, and with limited feedback, they likely prioritize group benefit and/or internal consistency with a cooperative self-image over short-term individual gain.\n\nThey do not appear to be driven by narrow outcome-maximization for themselves in the present decision; instead, they act as if maximizing the joint surplus or adhering to a fairness/cooperation principle is more important. Whether this stems from utilitarian reasoning, reciprocity expectations, or identity-based motives is unknown."

Their behavior fits a “committed cooperator” or “ethical cooperator” type: contribution decisions appear driven by an internal norm to contribute fully rather than by strategic adjustment.\n\nThey do not condition their contributions on others’ past behavior; reduced cooperation by peers does not trigger any visible retaliation or downward adjustment. This suggests either a strong fairness/efficiency norm that they follow regardless of others, or a belief that maintaining full cooperation is still the best response even in a partially free-riding group. They show high tolerance for payoff inequality to their own disadvantage, continuing to cooperate as others gain more by contributing less.\n\nRisk-wise, they accept the personal risk of being exploited and do not hedge by partially lowering contributions. Instead of experimenting or adapting, they lock into a simple, extreme strategy. There is no evidence of exploratory behavior or concern with maximizing own payoff under the given multiplier; they appear primarily motivated by cooperative or moral principles rather than outcome optimization.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThis player shows no end-game defection or decay in cooperation. Awareness of the finite horizon does not lead them to reduce contributions. Their behavior is time-consistent: they treat the final interaction the same as earlier ones, even after observing others shifting toward more self-regarding strategies over time.\n\nThis suggests they either (a) ignore standard end-game logic on principle, (b) place intrinsic value on acting cooperatively independent of future consequences, or (c) possibly misunderstand or disregard the strategic implications of the last round. Based solely on actions, they appear to follow a rule like “always fully contribute” rather than recalculating near the end. They do not escalate or retaliate when approaching the final round; their cooperative stance remains stable and uncompromising.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThis player continues to fully contribute even as others obtain higher payoffs by contributing little or nothing, indicating strong tolerance for being out-earned and no observable envy-driven response. They do not attempt to protect themselves against free riders by reducing cooperation, despite clear evidence that some group members benefit disproportionately.\n\nThey do not differentiate between moderately cooperative and strongly uncooperative peers in their subsequent behavior; outcomes showing others doing very well through low contributions do not alter their strategy. There is no sign of reactive adjustment based on observed payoff distributions, suggesting either low sensitivity to relative earnings or a deliberate choice to prioritize their cooperative norm over distributional concerns.\n\nBecause there are no punishment or reward tools available, their direct response is limited to changing contributions, and they choose not to use that channel for sanctioning or signaling. Their type therefore looks like a non-conditional, non-sanctioning cooperator who accepts unequal outcomes as the cost of adhering to a personal cooperation rule. Beliefs about others’ intentions or fairness concerns remain unknown beyond what is implied by their unchanging cooperation."

Their pattern indicates that they prioritize group efficiency over individual payoff, even when others systematically free-ride and when it is clear that contributing yields them strictly lower individual earnings than defecting.\n\nThey do not display conditional cooperation: their contributions do not track the average contributions of others, nor do they react to declines in group cooperation. This suggests that either (a) they adhere to a strong internal norm of always contributing, or (b) they follow a simple, pre-committed strategy not updated by experience. There is no evidence that they experiment with defection or mixed strategies.\n\nThey tolerate being exploited by free riders without changing their own behavior. This points toward a fairness or efficiency preference that is not implemented in a reciprocal way—if they care about fairness, they do not use their contribution decision to enforce it. Instead, they behave like a pure cooperator in a one-shot sense, every round.\n\nIn terms of risk, they accept the “risk” of systematically lower individual payoffs to maintain maximum public good provision. Given the parameters of the game, full contribution is individually irrational but socially optimal, so their behavior is consistent with strong pro-social or rule-following tendencies and low sensitivity to short-term material losses relative to internal principles.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThe player’s cooperation is insensitive to others’ payoffs and contribution patterns. As others alternate between relatively cooperative and more free-riding profiles, including periods where free riders earn strictly more than contributors, the player does not adjust. They neither reduce their contributions to avoid being exploited nor appear to reward cooperative phases by increasing from a previously lower level; their behavior is flat.\n\nThey observe that some players systematically benefit from contributing nothing while still receiving substantial returns from the group. Despite this, they do not respond by imitating the profitable strategy or by withdrawing their own support. This suggests that either they do not prioritize payoff comparison, or they do but choose not to act on it. There is no evidence of emotional reciprocity (retaliation, “teaching a lesson,” or strategic forgiveness) because they never change their action in response to others’ outcomes.\n\nBecause there is no punishment or reward mechanism available in this environment, we cannot observe how they would allocate costly sanctions or bonuses; their latent willingness to punish defectors or reward cooperators is unknown. All that can be inferred is that, when the only lever they have is their own contribution, they do not use it as a contingent response to others’ earnings or behavior. Their type is best characterized as a steadfast, non-conditional cooperator whose choices are effectively independent of others’ outcomes."

With the option limited to all-or-nothing contributions, they consistently choose the maximally cooperative action rather than alternating or experimenting. Their behavior does not track short-term personal payoff advantages: they continue to cooperate even when free riders earn more in the group and when overall group cooperation fluctuates. This indicates that immediate self-interest and strict payoff maximization are not their primary decision criteria.\n\nTheir contribution rule appears simple and rigid rather than contingent on others’ recent behavior. They do not adjust downward in response to persistent free riding, nor upward (beyond the already-maximal level) in response to higher cooperation. This suggests a strong internal norm or heuristic in favor of contributing everything, rather than a calibrated conditional-cooperator rule such as “match others’ average” or “cooperate only if enough others do.” Because they always select the cooperative option, their risk tolerance with respect to exploitation is high: they repeatedly accept being vulnerable to systematic free riding by others.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, they accept inequitable outcomes in which non-contributors consistently earn more than contributors. They do not respond by defecting to close this payoff gap, which implies that equalization of material payoffs is not an overriding motive. Instead, they prioritize maintaining the public good itself or adhering to a moral/strategic principle of cooperation. There is no evidence of strategic deviation near the end of the game, suggesting they are not using backward induction or end-game thinking in any observable way. Overall, they function as a principled, payoff-insensitive full cooperator within the constraint that contributions are binary.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThe player repeatedly observes that many others free ride and obtain higher payoffs, yet they do not alter their own cooperative behavior in response. This indicates a high tolerance for unequal outcomes and exploitation, or alternatively a deliberate choice to ignore such inequities. They do not engage in responsive strategies such as “retaliatory defection” or “protecting themselves” once it becomes clear that some group members systematically benefit more by contributing nothing.\n\nBecause punishment and reward are not available in this environment, there is no direct behavioral evidence of how they would spend costly points to sanction or reward others. However, their willingness to keep cooperating despite persistent free riding suggests they are unlikely to favor harsh, payoff-correcting responses; they appear more focused on sustaining contribution than on disciplining defectors or selectively incentivizing cooperators. Their behavior provides no indication of tracking specific individuals’ outcomes for reciprocation or targeted response; they treat the group as a whole and maintain their cooperative stance regardless of how advantageous the situation is for particular others. Overall, they react to others’ higher or lower earnings with behavioral inertia: they register these outcomes enough to see that exploitation is possible but do not let it redirect their own strategy."

There is no observable sensitivity to changes in the average contribution of others, to shifts in the balance of cooperators vs. freeriders, or to repeated evidence that contributing yields them a lower personal payoff than defecting would. This suggests that payoff-maximization is not their primary decision rule, at least in this context.\n\nThey accept a payoff structure where freeriders often earn more than they do, continuing to contribute fully. This indicates a willingness to tolerate exploitation and an apparent prioritization of collective efficiency over their own relative earnings. They behave as if they endorse a norm that “everyone should contribute fully,” but there is no indication that they condition their own behavior on whether that norm is met. Their risk tolerance appears high in social terms: they repeatedly expose themselves to the risk of being taken advantage of without ever hedging by defecting.\n\nOverall, they fit a “principled cooperator” type: someone who acts in line with a fixed cooperative principle, rather than adjusting strategically to others’ contributions or to changing incentives. Whether this principle is driven by moral preference, intrinsic satisfaction from cooperating, or a misunderstanding of the payoff structure is unknown.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThe player observes that non-contributors systematically attain higher individual payoffs when others contribute, yet they do not adjust their own behavior in response. They neither reduce cooperation when freeriders benefit more, nor increase cooperation beyond the already-maximal level when others contribute more. Their response to others’ outcomes is thus behaviorally inert: they maintain full cooperation regardless of who gains or loses.\n\nSince no explicit punishment or reward mechanisms are available, there is no direct evidence about how they would allocate costly sanctions or rewards. However, from their unwavering cooperative stance in the face of repeated exploitation, it is reasonable (though still uncertain) to infer that they are either strongly inequality-tolerant when inequality arises from under-contribution, or that they focus on the absolute level of group welfare rather than its distribution. They appear not to use others’ higher payoffs as a trigger for strategic retaliation via defection.\n\nThere is no sign of reactive learning from outcome patterns. Even when low group contributions reduce everyone’s earnings, they do not respond by protecting themselves through defection. This suggests a player who either discounts relative payoffs and outcome-based reciprocity, or who does not infer that deviating themselves would improve their own earnings.

When the group briefly collapses to minimal cooperation, they still maintain the same maximal contribution pattern, indicating either (a) a strong internal norm of “always contribute,” (b) a rule-based or heuristic strategy that they do not revise, or (c) low sensitivity to short-term payoff losses.

They tolerate persistent free-riding by another player without changing their own behavior, which suggests either acceptance of unequal benefit sharing, indifference to inequity, or a strong commitment to cooperation independent of fairness considerations.\n\nRisk tolerance appears high with respect to payoff variance: the player repeatedly exposes themselves to the risk of low private returns by contributing fully even when group behavior is unstable. At the same time, they do not experiment with alternative strategies, which suggests low exploration and high adherence to a single, pre-chosen rule.\n\nConditionality is effectively absent in the observed behavior: contributions are not contingent on recent group contributions, on the presence of a consistent free-rider, or on the temporary breakdown of cooperation.

Their behavior indicates that they prioritize maximizing group efficiency over individual short-term gain, even when the marginal per-capita return is below 1. They do not reduce their contribution when others briefly lower theirs, suggesting they are not conditionally cooperative in the usual sense but instead follow a pre-committed rule: always contribute fully. This rule appears to be grounded in an instrumental belief that such behavior yields the highest payoffs in these settings, rather than in an explicitly stated fairness or moral norm. Their risk tolerance is high with respect to exploitation: they remain fully cooperative even when doing so temporarily lowers their own payoff relative to others, indicating a willingness to accept short-term disadvantage to preserve or restore full-cooperation dynamics. Fairness concerns are present but implicit; they do not attempt to equalize outcomes via defection and do not retaliate when others earn more than they do.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nTheir communication style is brief, confident, and directive. They initiate coordination immediately by publicly committing to a simple, strong rule and inviting others to follow it. They frame full contribution as the payoff-maximizing strategy in this environment, using an appeal to prior knowledge about similar studies rather than emotional or moral arguments. This suggests a preference for rational-argument coordination over social pressure or moralizing. They are responsive enough to reinforce the joint strategy after another player affirms the plan, but they do not engage in extended conversation or relational small talk. Once the cooperation norm is established, they cease chatting and rely on actions to maintain it, indicating an efficiency-oriented, low-verbal-engagement style. Overall, they use communication strategically to set a clear norm early, then withdraw from further discussion when the group appears aligned.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey monitor others’ contributions and payoffs but maintain their own strategy regardless of short-term deviations. When others match their full-cooperation strategy, they simply continue with the existing plan, showing satisfaction with symmetric high payoffs and no desire to optimize further or to free-ride. When others reduce their contributions and obtain higher payoffs than the focal player, there is no observable retaliatory response, no reduction in contribution, and no attempt to confront or shame them in chat. Instead, the player continues to fully contribute, implicitly signaling a desire to sustain or restore full cooperation rather than escalate a breakdown. Once others return to full contribution, the player does not comment on the earlier deviation, suggesting low interest in blame or backward-looking fairness enforcement and a stronger focus on forward-looking efficiency. Overall, their reaction pattern indicates a tolerant, non-punitive, norm-stabilizing type who absorbs temporary inequities without strategic adjustment, in the expectation that unconditional cooperation is still best in the long run."

This suggests that either (a) they adopt a rule-based norm such as “always contribute” and follow it rigidly, or (b) they have a strong preference for maximizing group welfare and are willing to accept systematic exploitation. Because the contribution choice is binary, no inference can be made about fine-grained fairness thresholds, but they do not appear sensitive to inequity in a way that leads to behavioral change. Their risk tolerance with respect to cooperation is high: they continue to invest even when the cooperative climate is mixed and when it would be individually profitable to withhold. There is no evidence of opportunism or payoff-maximizing defection; they prioritize cooperation over individual gain under all observed conditions.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThe player shows no end-game decline in cooperation. Their contribution rule is the same at the beginning, middle, and very end of the game, even when the number of remaining rounds is small and all incentives to “harvest” without contributing are at their highest. This indicates strong horizon awareness is either not behaviorally relevant or overridden by a fixed cooperative rule or intrinsic motivation. They do not appear to engage in backward induction or strategic planning about the final rounds; instead, they maintain a constant cooperative stance through to the last decision. This pattern is consistent with a type that treats cooperation as a standing principle rather than a calculative, time-contingent strategy.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThe player has full visibility of others’ contributions and payoffs and often sees clear free-riding and payoff advantages for non-contributors, yet their behavior remains unchanged. They do not punish or reward (these mechanisms are unavailable), but more importantly they do not “self-punish” others by withdrawing their own cooperation in response to unfair outcomes. They tolerate being systematically out-earned by low contributors when that occurs and do not retaliate by defecting in subsequent rounds. This suggests low behavioral reactivity to inequality and a high tolerance for being exploited, at least within the constraints of this game. They appear not to condition their actions on others’ specific identities or histories: they continue to cooperate even in the presence of persistent low contributors and even when overall group cooperation fluctuates. Their implicit belief about others is uncertain, but their revealed preference is to cooperate independently of others’ outcomes, indicating either optimism about group benefit, indifference to relative standing, or a strong norm-driven motive that does not depend on others’ behavior."

Risk tolerance regarding being the “sucker” is high; they appear insensitive to the strategic risk that others might underprovide.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThe player shows no end-game decay in cooperation. Even as the game progresses and the remaining number of rounds shrinks to zero, they continue to contribute fully, without any sign of tapering, hedging, or last‑round defection. They behave as if the horizon does not alter the appropriate contribution level.\n\nThis suggests that they either (a) do not use backward induction or strategic horizon reasoning in their decisions, or (b) choose to ignore such logic in favor of a stable cooperative principle. They treat the final rounds identically to early and middle rounds, implying that the knowledge that interaction is about to end does not weaken their cooperative norm.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThe player’s behavior is invariant to others’ payoffs and contribution choices. They repeatedly observe that some peers earn higher payoffs by contributing nothing or less, yet they do not adjust their own strategy toward defection, nor do they reduce contributions in response to perceived free‑riding.

Their giving pattern suggests either a strong internal norm of consistent cooperation or a simple heuristic of “always contribute everything,” rather than a strategy that encodes concern for reciprocity, revenge, or payoff fairness.

They always give the entire endowment to the public fund and never deviate, even as others fluctuate and as their own relative payoff is persistently lower than that of several group members. There is no evidence of conditional cooperation; their behavior does not adjust upward or downward in response to higher or lower average contributions, nor to changes in who is contributing more or less. They appear to hold a strong internal norm that “the right thing” is to fully contribute regardless of what others do, and they tolerate being exploited by lower contributors without reacting in their own contribution choice. Risk tolerance is high in the sense that they persist with full cooperation despite clear information that others free-ride and that this leaves them earning less than others. Fairness norms seem to be internally driven rather than reciprocal: they behave fairly (by contributing fully) but do not condition on whether the environment is fair to them.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey never use punishment at all, despite repeated and salient opportunities and despite the presence of clear low contributors and a powerful, high-leverage punishment technology. They also see other players frequently using punishment (in particular against a chronically low-contributing target), yet they neither join in nor imitate this behavior. This suggests a very high threshold for punishing; either they avoid harming others on principle, or they reject the cost of sanctioning as an acceptable tool, even when it would be efficient or group-beneficial. There is no sign of retaliatory punishment, as they are never punished themselves and never punish in return. There is also no sign of using punishment strategically for deterrence or norm enforcement; they do not appear to try to shape others’ contributions through negative incentives. Overall, they present as a non-punisher with strong reluctance to impose costs on others, even on clear free riders.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nUnknown. They are never the target of punishment, so there is no evidence of how they respond when punished or how they treat identifiable punishers afterward. Their tendencies toward unconditional cooperation and non-punishment suggest, with low confidence, that they would be unlikely to retaliate and might either ignore punishment or possibly interpret it as information rather than a provocation, but this is speculative.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey never use rewards, despite the mechanism being clearly explained and despite visible examples of others using positive rewards. They do not reward either high contributors who match their own behavior or players who reward them. This indicates that they do not engage in explicit positive reinforcement, alliance signaling, or gratitude expression through the reward tool. Given that they already cooperate maximally without conditioning on others, they may see rewarding as unnecessary, too costly, or outside their preferred way of interacting. Their cooperativeness is “silent”: they help the group through contributions but do not invest extra resources to shape or encourage others’ behavior via rewards.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThey receive rewards several times from specific co-players, but they never reciprocate with rewards of their own and they do not alter their contribution behavior, which is already at the maximum. There is no observable attempt to form a mutual-reward alliance or to differentially favor those who reward them versus those who do not. Their gratitude, if present, is not expressed through the available mechanisms. This suggests a style where they maintain their own cooperative standard independently of social approval or side payments, and do not translate being rewarded into explicit reciprocity via the reward tool. Whether they feel gratitude internally is unknown; behaviorally, they remain unchanged and non-reciprocal with respect to rewards.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey repeatedly observe that some players contribute less while earning higher payoffs and sometimes also face heavy punishment from others. Despite this clear evidence of free-riding, payoff inequality, and active sanctioning norms in the group, they neither adjust their own contributions nor participate in enforcement. They tolerate being a consistent net contributor who often earns less than others without any visible attempt to protect themselves or to pressure laggards. They similarly observe positive rewards flowing among others (and to themselves at times) without changing their behavior. Overall, they appear largely indifferent, in terms of strategic adjustment, to others’ payoffs, to how much others spend on punishment or reward, and to who is targeted. Their primary reference point seems to be their own internal rule to fully cooperate, not the evolving distribution of costs and benefits in the group."

Their strategy is non-conditional: they do not reduce their contribution in response to low contributors, free riders, or declines in the average. They also do not escalate beyond full contribution because they are already at the maximum. This suggests a strong internal norm or rule (“always cooperate fully”) that overrides short-term profit motives.\n\nThey tolerate substantial risk of exploitation: they keep contributing fully even when multiple others repeatedly contribute little or nothing, and even when their personal payoff is materially reduced by others’ behavior and by punishment. Their fairness standard appears unconditional and collective: they behave as if the right thing is to maximize group efficiency through full contributions, regardless of whether others reciprocate. There is no sign of strategic experimentation; the contribution pattern is fixed from start to finish.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nAwareness of the horizon does not change their behavior. They maintain the same full-contribution rule through early, middle, and final rounds, including the very last round where future reciprocity is impossible. There is no observable end-game decay, no attempt to “cash out” by free-riding at the end, and no indication of increased opportunism when continuation value drops to zero. This is consistent with a principle-driven or commitment-based type rather than a forward-looking payoff maximizer. If anything, the consistency into the final round indicates that their rule is time-invariant and not tied to expectations of future rewards or punishments.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey never use punishment, despite multiple opportunities where punishing low contributors, free riders, or retaliatory punishers could be justified on either fairness or deterrence grounds. This holds even when they themselves are punished repeatedly and sometimes very heavily, and even when the technology of punishment is highly effective. Their non-use of punishment appears to be a stable policy, not a function of everyone behaving well.\n\nMotivationally, this suggests either a strong aversion to harming others (even at a profit to the group or as revenge), or a view that engaging in punishment is not worthwhile or not part of their role. There is no evidence that they selectively punish (e.g., only extreme free riders); instead, they opt out entirely. Deterrence is not part of their toolkit; they rely on their own consistent cooperation rather than on enforcing norms.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nThey are punished multiple times, including instances of substantial cumulative deductions. Punishers are identifiable, so they can in principle target them. Yet they do not retaliate, do not lower contributions in response, and do not adapt their strategy to avoid further punishment. Their contribution level remains maximal and their punishment behavior remains zero.\n\nThis pattern indicates high forgiveness or, at minimum, a strong non-retaliation stance. They neither “teach a lesson” to punishers nor shift towards self-protective defection. They appear willing to absorb personal losses without changing behavior. There is no sign that they attempt to appease punishers by changing contributions (they are already fully cooperative), which implies they interpret punishment as something they will endure rather than something to respond to strategically. Whether they update their beliefs about others’ intentions is unknown; behaviorally, they remain steadfast.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey never reward anyone, despite the presence of many consistently high contributors, including others who also contribute fully. This cannot be explained by lack of candidates: there are plenty of cooperative peers. It is more consistent with either a systematic reluctance to spend on others at all beyond contribution, or a judgment that the reward mechanism is too inefficient to justify use. Given that they are already making maximal contributions, their non-use of reward suggests that, in their mind, “cooperating in the PGG” and “using side-payments to shape behavior” are distinct, and they only endorse the former.\n\nThey do not appear to use reward as a strategic reinforcement tool (e.g., to support other full contributors) or as an expression of gratitude. Their cooperative stance is enacted entirely through direct contributions, not through meta-actions such as rewarding.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThey receive several rewards over the course of the game. Because rewarders are identifiable, they could in principle reciprocate with rewards or form implicit “alliances” of mutual rewarding. They do neither. Their reward behavior remains at zero; their contribution behavior is already at the maximum and does not change in response to being rewarded.\n\nThis suggests a limited use of reciprocity at the meta level. They accept rewards passively but do not mirror them, even toward clearly cooperative peers. Their cooperation is thus not contingent on others’ support or acknowledgment; it appears self-driven. Whether they feel gratitude is unknown, but they do not convert that into strategic or emotional reciprocity through the available mechanisms.\n\nOverall, this player is best characterized as a principled, unconditional cooperator who always fully contributes, never engages in punishment or reward, does not retaliate when harmed, and does not adjust behavior in response to end-game incentives or social feedback."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a strong, almost unconditional cooperator. They consistently give the full endowment to the public fund in nearly every round, including the very first and the very last. The only exception is a single mid-game deviation where they contribute half their endowment while the group is broadly cooperative; this looks more like an experiment or temporary adjustment than a strategy shift, as they immediately return to full contributions and then maintain them through to the end. Their behavior indicates a stable fairness norm that favors high cooperation regardless of whether others free-ride. They tolerate persistent low contributions by at least one player without using their own contribution level as a retaliatory tool. They seem risk-tolerant regarding exploitation and prioritize maintaining a high-contribution environment over guarding against being taken advantage of. There is no clear evidence that their contributions are conditionally responsive to others’ individual choices; instead, they act as a consistent “moral anchor” for cooperation.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nUnknown. There is no chat content in the transcript, so their tone, persuasion attempts, and responsiveness in communication cannot be inferred. Their behavioral pattern (steadfast high contributions plus intermittent punishment) is consistent with someone who might advocate for fairness and cooperation, but this is speculative and unsupported by direct evidence.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThey show clear horizon awareness (the number of rounds is visible), but they do not reduce cooperation as the game approaches the final rounds. In the closing phase, they maintain maximal contributions and keep using punishment selectively, including in the very last rounds. There is no decay in their cooperative behavior or obvious “last-round defection.” Their pattern suggests they treat the end-game similarly to earlier stages, remaining focused on norm enforcement and group welfare even when there is no future opportunity for others to reciprocate. Any subtle adjustments in punishment size near the end appear small and do not amount to a qualitative shift in strategy.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey are clearly willing to incur substantial personal costs to punish. They do not punish in every round, but when they do, they often spend a non-trivial portion of their payoff. Their punishment is selective and appears targeted at players whose behavior deviates from a cooperative norm: primarily very low contributors or those who repeatedly contribute far less than the group of high contributors. They sometimes punish even when group contributions are already high, consistent with enforcing a principle (“everyone should at least match the group norm”) rather than purely responding to immediate payoff losses. Their punishment is not obviously tit-for-tat or retaliatory against those who punish them personally; instead, it seems oriented toward norm enforcement and deterrence, even at a net cost to themselves. They do not escalate indiscriminately when they receive deductions; after absorbing punishment from unknown others, they continue to cooperate and sometimes still punish apparent free-riders rather than attempting broad revenge.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey appear attentive to how others’ contribution and punishment choices translate into payoffs. When they punish, they often choose amounts that significantly reduce a target’s payoff, indicating sensitivity to the relative advantage that low contributors or non-punishers might gain. They do not mimic others’ strategies in a straightforward way: even when others gain by contributing little or by spending heavily on punishment, this player does not follow those patterns. Instead, they maintain their own cooperative standard and use punishment to narrow payoff gaps created by perceived free-riding. They do not reward high contributors, even implicitly, beyond maintaining high contributions themselves. There is no clear evidence of resentment-based targeting of players who end up with particularly high payoffs if those players are also cooperative; their concern seems more about contribution fairness than about absolute earnings. Overall, they respond to outcome patterns by reinforcing cooperation through stable giving and by strategically penalizing behavior that undermines that outcome structure."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a stable, unconditional full cooperator within the available choice set. They always allocate their entire endowment to the public fund, even when others defect or when defection appears profitable. Their behavior suggests a strong internal norm favoring maximum collective efficiency over personal earnings. They do not condition their contributions on others’ past or current behavior, nor on observed punishment patterns. There is no evidence of strategic adjustment, experimentation, or hedging; they maintain the same cooperative choice in the presence of persistent free-riding and heavy punitive activity by others. This implies either a principled commitment to contribution, a belief that sustained cooperation is optimal regardless of others’ deviations, or a lack of concern with fine-tuning payoffs. Their tolerance for being exploited by non-contributors appears high, and they do not react by reducing cooperation, indicating a preference for norm-following or efficiency over outcome-based reciprocity. Risk tolerance regarding payoff variance is unknown; what is observable is a willingness to accept lower relative payoffs to uphold a cooperative norm.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey never use the punishment option, despite repeated exposure to non-contributing peers and clear evidence that others are willing to incur substantial costs to sanction defectors. This consistent non-use holds regardless of whether free-riders are lightly or heavily punished by others, and regardless of whether defectors are repeat offenders. Their pattern is best described as non-punitive or pacifist within the game: they forego both first-order enforcement (punishing defectors) and any form of second-order punishment (punishing cooperators who do or do not punish). The transcript does not allow them to express their reasoning, so their underlying motives are uncertain. Plausible interpretations include a strict payoff-maximization at the individual level regarding punishment (avoiding the direct cost), a deontological aversion to harming others even when they defect, or a reliance on others to perform enforcement (“free-riding” on punishment while still contributing). Because they always cooperate yet never punish, they do not fit the classic “strong reciprocator” profile; instead, they align more with a “pure cooperator” type: contributing fully without engaging in costly enforcement. There is no sign of retaliatory, strategic, or signaling use of punishment.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nThey are never punished in the observed play, so direct responses to being sanctioned cannot be inferred. Consequently, their propensity for forgiveness, retaliation, or compliance in the face of personal punishment is unknown. Since punishers are identifiable in this environment but they never become a target, there is no evidence of them engaging in counter-punishment or reward-like compensatory behavior toward those who punish others. Their combination of full cooperation and zero punishment might make them an unlikely punishment target in general, but that remains speculative. Overall, their behavioral response to punishers is unknown, and their sensitivity to social signaling via punishment cannot be determined from the available data.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey observe substantial variability in others’ contributions, payoffs, and punishment behavior, including repeated free-riding by some players and heavy, targeted sanctions imposed by others. Despite this, they maintain unchanged full cooperation and zero punishment. They do not appear to adjust behavior in response to the severity or direction of punishment (who gets punished, how much is spent, or how much is deducted), which suggests they are not using others’ outcomes as a learning signal for strategic adaptation. They also do not appear to respond to fairness cues: even when free-riders obtain relatively high payoffs before or after punishment, the focal player does not shift toward defection or enforcement. This indicates low behavioral reactivity to inequality, exploitation, or aggressive sanctioning by others. There is no evidence of them rewarding or aligning with particular “coalitions” of punishers or cooperators; they simply keep contributing maximally and refrain from intervening, regardless of the emerging payoff landscape. Their implicit belief about others’ future behavior is unknown, but their actions imply that they do not rely on predictive adjustments: they behave as if their own norm of cooperation is largely independent of how others are currently performing or being treated."

They always contribute their entire endowment, regardless of how others behave or how the group’s average contribution changes. Their behavior suggests a strong internal norm favoring full contribution rather than a conditional “cooperate if others do” rule. They do not visibly adjust to repeated free-riding by some group members, indicating either principled commitment to cooperation, indifference to relative disadvantage, or an instrumental belief that consistent high contributions are best for long-run payoffs. They appear risk-tolerant with respect to exploitation: they keep contributing fully even when low contributors earn more in those periods and even when punishment by others is already heavily targeting defectors. Overall, they act as a pure, norm-driven cooperator who does not condition on others’ fairness or on apparent endgame considerations.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey never use the punishment option, despite recurrent and sometimes severe free-riding by others and despite clear evidence that other cooperators are willing to spend heavily to sanction low contributors. This indicates a strong reluctance to engage in costly punishment, even when it would be norm-consistent (punishing defectors) and socially supported (many others are doing it). The most direct inference is that they prioritize preserving their own payoff and/or avoiding harming others, over enforcing contribution norms. Motives could include a pacifist or non-interventionist disposition, an efficiency concern about the deadweight loss from punishment, or uncertainty about the fairness or accuracy of punishing specific individuals; which of these dominates is unknown. They also never punish in response to any prior pattern of others’ contributions or punishment behavior, suggesting they are not motivated by retaliation or by strategic deterrence. Their punishment behavior is best described as strictly non-punishing and non-retaliatory.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nThey are never targeted with punishment in the observed interaction, so their direct reaction to being punished is unknown. However, they clearly see that some players repeatedly spend substantial amounts on punishing others; despite this, they neither join in punishing nor shift their own contribution pattern. This implies that the mere presence of active punishers does not induce them to become an enforcer or to lower their contributions out of fear or resentment. Their likely stance toward punishers is tolerant or at least non-confrontational: they do not counter-punish, do not imitate, and do not visibly adjust behavior to align with punishers’ apparent norms. Whether they would forgive or retaliate if personally punished is unknown and cannot be inferred with confidence.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey consistently observe that defectors sometimes earn more and are sometimes heavily punished, while punishers incur large costs. Despite this, they make no observable adjustments either toward free-riding (to match high private payoffs) or toward punishing (to support norm enforcement). This suggests they are not strongly payoff-comparative: relative earnings and others’ costs do not appear to drive their choices. They also do not appear to “reward” cooperators via differential punishment (e.g., sparing some and punishing others), since they never punish at all. They seem behaviorally “decoupled” from others’ outcomes: they maintain their own cooperative strategy regardless of whether cooperation is collectively rewarded or undermined by defectors. Learning or adaptation to the emerging incentive landscape is minimal or absent; they behave as if guided by a fixed rule (“always contribute fully; never punish”), rather than by responsive updating to observed payoffs, sanctions, or evolving group norms."

They consistently give their entire endowment to the public fund every time, with no adjustment in response to others’ free-riding or mixed contribution patterns. Their behavior fits a strong cooperative or “moral contributor” type: they act as if contributing fully is the right thing to do, independent of short-term payoff optimization.\n\nThey tolerate systematic free-riding by several others without ever reducing their own contribution. This suggests a fairness norm that is internal and not contingent on reciprocity in this environment, or a belief that maintaining high contributions is more important than correcting exploitation. Risk tolerance appears high regarding being exploited: they accept lower relative payoffs so long as the group project remains well-funded. There is no observable strategic experimentation; they do not probe others’ reactions by changing their own contributions.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey never use the punishment option, despite repeated and clear opportunities to sanction identifiable low contributors at a relatively efficient punishment technology. This holds even when free-riders gain substantially higher payoffs than contributors and when others are actively punishing those same free-riders.\n\nTheir type is therefore a “non-punishing cooperator.” They are either unwilling to incur personal costs to discipline defectors, or they judge that punishing is not worthwhile or not appropriate in this setting. There is no evidence that their restraint depends on who is defecting or on how severe the defection is; their non-punishment stance is consistent across varying contribution patterns and across changes in how intensely others punish.\n\nBecause they never punish, any underlying motive—deterrence, retaliation, or norm-enforcement—remains unexpressed; the safest inference is that they prioritize keeping all of their payoff once contributions are made, and/or they reject costly sanctioning as a tool.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nThey are never punished by others at any point, so there is no direct behavioral evidence of how they respond to being sanctioned. Their willingness to maintain full contributions while seeing others heavily engage in punishment indicates that they do not react to others’ punitive behavior by joining in or by withdrawing cooperation. However, this is a response to the presence of punishment in the group, not to being personally targeted.\n\nTheir inclination to never punish, even when others do so aggressively, suggests they are not easily drawn into cycles of retaliation. Whether they would forgive, comply, or retaliate if directly punished is unknown; confidence in any more specific characterization here is low.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey observe substantial differences in others’ payoffs driven by both contribution levels and punishment costs/deductions. Some players sacrifice large amounts to punish, and some low contributors earn higher or lower payoffs depending on how much they are sanctioned. The focal player does not visibly adapt their own behavior—neither contributions nor punishment usage—in response to these observed outcomes.\n\nThey do not appear to mimic high earners, avoid strategies that lead to being punished (they are already fully cooperative), or align with heavy punishers despite seeing them incur large costs. Likewise, they do not seem to respond in any way to the fact that free-riders sometimes end up better off or worse off than contributors; their strategy is unchanged and rigid.\n\nThis pattern is consistent with a player who treats others’ outcomes as largely irrelevant to their own chosen rule of behavior. They neither exploit punishment as a tool to shape others’ payoffs nor adjust to the evolving payoff structure generated by others’ sanctions. Any deeper beliefs about fairness of these outcomes, or emotional reactions to them, are unknown from the data."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a strict, stable full contributor. They always give the entire endowment and never deviate, even when a few others free‑ride at the start and at the end. Their behavior suggests they treat full contribution as the obvious, default “correct” action rather than a contingent response. Early comments show they hold a fairness and efficiency norm that everyone should contribute; they frame non‑contributors as “selfish.” Once the group reaches universal cooperation, they maintain full contributions without hesitation, apparently prioritizing group payoff and norm consistency over individual short‑term gain. They do not appear to condition contributions on others’ recent behavior in any fine‑grained way; instead they exhibit a rule‑based strategy: everyone ought to contribute fully, including themselves, regardless of small deviations. Risk tolerance around being exploited is relatively high—they keep cooperating even when a free‑rider briefly appears again near the end. Their choices are highly predictable and non‑volatile.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nTheir tone is norm‑setting and mildly moralizing but not hostile. Early on, they actively try to coordinate the group around full contributions, explicitly stating that contributing is best for everyone and discouraging selfishness. Once cooperation is established, they mostly step back, offering occasional positive reinforcement to the group and encouraging them to “keep it going.” They do not join off‑topic banter and ignore side conversations about geography, earnings platforms, or jokes; their communication is task‑focused and sparse. They respond to the group’s success with brief praise, aligning themselves with cooperative group identity. They show no signs of aggression, sarcasm, or trolling, and they do not escalate when others defect; instead they rely on gentle social pressure and a single explicit threat of sanction to support the cooperation norm. Responsiveness to others is selective: they engage when it concerns contribution behavior and norms, but otherwise remain quiet.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey never actually use the punishment mechanism, despite having multiple opportunities and at least two clear instances of others contributing nothing. However, they explicitly state a conditional intention to punish a specific low contributor if that behavior continues, targeting a repeat defector rather than punishing immediately. This suggests they are willing in principle to use punishment as a deterrent against persistent free‑riding, but prefer to give others a chance to comply after social pressure. They appear selective: sanctions are reserved for clear, repeated norm violations, not one‑off mistakes. They do not express any desire for revenge, only for enforcing contribution norms. Once the target complies, they drop the idea and never revisit punishment, even when another player defects later; that last defection occurs against a backdrop of strong overall cooperation and end‑game uncertainty, and they still abstain from punishing. Overall, they are a reluctant, conditional punisher who prioritizes communication and group coordination over costly sanctions.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nThey are never punished in this game, so their direct reactions to being sanctioned are unknown. They never observe a need to retaliate or to respond publicly to punishment, because no one targets them. Based on their general style, if punished in a future setting, they are more likely to interpret it as norm enforcement than as a personal attack, and could update or at least acknowledge it, but this is speculative and low confidence. Their behavior provides no evidence of retaliatory tendencies or of forgiving explicit punishers, so their exact response pattern to identifiable punishers remains unknown."

There is no sign that they condition contributions on fairness, reciprocity, or average group contribution levels; their strategy is simple and consistent rather than contingent. Their type is best characterized as a norm-driven unconditional cooperator rather than a calculating conditional cooperator.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThis player never uses punishment at any point, despite frequent and salient opportunities: they see repeated low contributors, extreme “antisocial” punishers who sink their own payoffs, and targets who are heavily sanctioned by others. They still refrain from punishing. This indicates either a strong aversion to harming others, a belief that punishment is not their role or not effective, or a strict focus on conserving their own coins for income rather than norm enforcement via costly harm. There is no evidence they use punishment strategically for deterrence, reciprocity, or retaliation, even when non-cooperators could be targeted or when others spend large amounts on punishment. Their punishment threshold, if any, appears extremely high or practically unreachable in this environment. Overall, they are a non-punisher by type.\n\n<REWARD>\nThis player also never uses reward, despite the reward mechanism being relatively efficient and heavily used by some other participants. They receive rewards multiple times yet do not reciprocate or join in rewarding high contributors. This suggests either indifference to gratitude signaling, a preference not to intervene in others’ outcomes, or a very strict cost-minimizing stance with respect to second-order actions (even prosocial ones). There is no evidence of targeted reinforcement of high contributors, coalition-building via mutual rewarding, or attempts to steer group behavior. Their strategy regarding reward is purely passive: they accept rewards but never spend to give them, even when many others do. As a type, they are a non-rewarder who decouples their own cooperation from any second-order prosocial signaling.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThis player appears behaviorally insensitive to others’ payoffs, punishment costs, and rewards. They continue the same full-contribution, zero-punishment, zero-reward pattern through episodes where some players are harshly punished, some spend extreme amounts on punishment, some give out large volumes of reward, and some free-ride or oscillate. There is no observable adjustment to the distribution of earnings, to instances of players taking heavy losses, or to players who profit from low contributions. This suggests they either (a) largely ignore the detailed social dynamics and focus on playing their own fixed strategy, or (b) maintain a principled stance that their own behavior should not be contingent on others’ outcomes. They do not appear to seek reciprocity, alliance formation, revenge, or “teaching” through payoff manipulation. In personality terms, they present as a steadfast, norm-driven cooperator who treats cooperation as a personal rule, and who is disengaged from or uninterested in second-order social control, even when it might be profitable or socially expressive. Their beliefs about others’ motives and learning are unknown, but their observable response to others’ outcomes is extreme passivity and non-reactivity."

They do not appear to condition their contribution on group averages, on the presence of free riders, or on prior punishment/reward received. This suggests a rule-based or norm-following strategy: they decide that full contribution is the “correct” action and stick to it. Risk tolerance appears moderate to high: they accept exposure to exploitation by lower contributors without hedging. Their fairness notion seems oriented to “doing their part” rather than enforcing proportionality or reciprocity in contributions, since they never reduce their own contribution in response to others contributing less.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThe player is a *non-punisher* in practice. They never use punitive options, even when there are clear low contributors who benefit from the public fund. This reluctance holds despite punishment being relatively efficient at reducing others’ payoffs. They thus show no observable inclination toward either deterrence or retaliation. The absence of any punishment, combined with unwavering full cooperation, is compatible with several possible motives: disliking payoff destruction on principle, prioritizing their own earnings, or doubting the effectiveness or justice of anonymous punishment when individual impacts are hard to track. Because they never punish, their specific triggers or selectivity thresholds remain unknown. There is no evidence that being punished themselves motivates any punitive response; they do not escalate or “even the score.” Overall, they behave as a high-cooperation, low-enforcement type: willing to contribute but not to incur additional costs to discipline free riders.\n\n<REWARD>\nThe player is also a *non-rewarder* in practice. They never spend resources to reward others, even though many group members match their full-cooperation strategy. This suggests they do not use positive incentives as a strategic tool, either to encourage high contributors or to build reciprocal ties. Their consistent refusal to reward, together with their non-punishing stance, points to a generally low willingness to spend beyond the initial contribution, even for prosocial regulation. Whether this reflects a belief that rewards are unnecessary, an effort to protect their own payoff after contributing fully, or low confidence in the impact of anonymous rewards is unknown. They do not appear to use rewards as gratitude signals for being rewarded themselves; receiving rewards does not change their non-rewarding pattern. In sum, they are a pure unconditional cooperator who leaves the incentive environment untouched: they rely entirely on their own contribution rather than on rewards or sanctions to shape group behavior."

They always give the maximum possible amount to the public good in every decision, regardless of what others do, whether others free-ride, whether contributions dip, or whether they themselves are occasionally targeted with deductions.

They therefore appear principled or rule-driven rather than outcome-responsive.\n\nThey show no evidence of experimenting with selfish deviation, even when they would clearly profit monetarily by contributing nothing while others contribute fully. This suggests that they prioritize a cooperation norm or efficiency motive over individual payoff optimization. Their willingness to keep contributing fully despite sometimes being singled out with small deductions indicates tolerance for risk and for exploitation: they accept the possibility of unfair outcomes without changing their cooperative stance. There is no indication that they track or react to small deviations in others’ contributions; they contribute fully both in perfectly cooperative environments and when there are one or two non-contributors.\n\nOverall, their contribution pattern is best described as unconditional, high-cost cooperation anchored in a stable internal norm (e.g., “always do the socially efficient thing”) rather than responsive reciprocity.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThis player never uses punishment at any point, despite frequent opportunities and many clear targets (low contributors, extreme punishers, and erratic rewarders). Their willingness to absorb the cost of others’ defection and of being punished themselves, without ever punishing back, indicates an aversion to using sanctions as a tool.\n\nThey do not retaliate when they personally receive deductions; they also do not engage in third-party punishment of clear low contributors or heavy free-riders on others’ reward efforts. Given that they repeatedly observe strong punishment against low contributors and against particular individuals, their inaction looks intentional rather than uninformed. This suggests either a principled rejection of punitive behavior (“I don’t do punishment”) or a strict efficiency calculus that sees punishment as too wasteful, even when it might deter future defection.\n\nThey also do not appear to use punishment strategically to signal toughness or enforce norms. Their stance is consistent with a non-punitive, non-retaliatory type who tolerates norm violations and noise rather than paying to discipline others.\n\n<REWARD>\nThis player also never uses reward, despite being surrounded by others who sometimes spend heavily on rewarding. They receive positive transfers from multiple others in various cooperative phases but never reciprocate with reward behavior, even in periods of uniformly high contribution where rewarding cooperators could be justified either by gratitude or by a desire to stabilize cooperation.\n\nTheir refusal to reward holds even when many others are clearly willing to incur substantial costs to reward the group. This makes it unlikely that they simply “don’t understand” the mechanism; instead, they seem to regard reward as unnecessary or inefficient. They show no use of reward as a strategic tool for reinforcing full contributions or attracting future reciprocity, nor as an emotional response to being rewarded.\n\nTaken together with their non-use of punishment, they appear to adopt a “pure contribution only” approach: they contribute maximally to the public good but opt out of all second-order mechanisms, whether positive or negative.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThis player is behaviorally indifferent to others’ payoffs, punishment, and reward activity in the sense that these observations do not alter their own strategy. They observe severe punishment of some players, heavy reward-giving by others, occasional free-riding, and spontaneous waves of cooperation and sanctioning, yet their own pattern—always full contribution, no sanctions, no rewards—remains unchanged.\n\nThey do not appear to reward those who reward them, nor punish those who deduct from them. This suggests they either (a) do not place weight on fairness in second-order interactions, focusing only on their own contribution norm, or (b) consciously separate “what I do” (contribute fully) from “what others do,” choosing not to engage in payoff-based responses.\n\nTheir lack of behavioral adjustment in response to being occasionally targeted with deductions implies a high level of tolerance for inequality and noise: they absorb unfair or unexplained hits without attempting to correct them or signal disapproval. At the same time, they do not exploit others’ generosity; they never take advantage of reward-heavy or punishment-enforced cooperative phases by secretly defecting. Instead, they seem to treat the entire environment—others’ contributions, punishments, and rewards—as background conditions, while they adhere rigidly to a simple personal policy: always cooperate fully, and never spend on social control.\n\nIn summary, this player is a “principled non-enforcing cooperator”: they consistently maximize their contribution to the group, ignore both temptations to free-ride and opportunities to sanction or reward, and remain unaffected in behavior by the complex and sometimes extreme payoff patterns generated by others."

They do not anchor on a single contribution level; instead, they frequently shift between very low and very high contributions. They clearly understand that contributing can be profitable when others also contribute, because they repeatedly choose high contributions in environments where group contributions appear strong. At the same time, they are comfortable free-riding and sometimes take the full endowment while still benefiting from others’ cooperation.\n\nTheir contributions track the perceived cooperativeness of the group in a broad, qualitative way: when others as a whole appear generous, the player is generally willing to join in, though rarely as the most altruistic member. When the group seems more mixed or deteriorating, they reduce their own contribution sharply, sometimes down to zero, even if cooperation has not completely collapsed. They do not insist on strict equality or fairness; they tolerate contributing more than many low contributors around them at times, and at other times they themselves are among the least generous while others are still contributing substantially. This suggests weak or flexible fairness norms: they care about payoff-relevant conditions (is it lucrative to contribute now?) more than about matching others exactly.\n\nRisk-wise, the player shows a willingness to “gamble” on high contributions when the environment looks cooperative, accepting the immediate personal sacrifice for the expectation of a good group return. However, they do not sustain high contributions unconditionally. Their pattern indicates a payoff-sensitive, opportunistic stance rather than a principled commitment to cooperation or a strict free-riding strategy.\n\nOverall, they are a payoff-oriented conditional cooperator: willing to support the public good when it seems profitable and somewhat socially supported, but quick to scale back and free-ride when they sense fragility or unevenness in group contributions. Their strategy is adaptive rather than rigid, but also noisy and inconsistent, suggesting that they update heuristically rather than following a clear, stable rule.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThe player appears aware that the game has a finite horizon, but they do not exhibit a simple linear decay or a pure “end-spurt” of defection. In the final portion of the game, they continue to vary their contributions, sometimes contributing very little and sometimes at moderate-to-high levels. They do not switch into a pure defector mode in the last few rounds, nor do they escalate to full cooperation as a final gesture.\n\nInstead, their late-game behavior remains conditional and opportunistic: they adjust contributions up when the group as a whole still looks reasonably cooperative, and they reduce them when the environment seems more mixed or deteriorating, even very close to the final round. This implies that, even when the end is near, their primary reference remains the current cooperative climate and expected payoff, not a strict backward-induction logic or a moral norm about “finishing strong.”\n\nIn short, their end-game strategy continues the same pattern as earlier: flexible conditional cooperation with intermittent free-riding, rather than a clear terminal collapse or a final cooperative surge."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a highly volatile, opportunistic conditional cooperator who oscillates between full free-riding and substantial giving. Their average contribution level is moderate, but it is composed of many zeros and multiple high or even maximum contributions. This pattern indicates they do not follow a simple fixed rule (always cooperate / always defect / constant amount); instead, they adjust frequently and in large jumps.\n\nThey clearly understand that others are often contributing generously and that high group contributions yield high payoffs for everyone, including themselves. They repeatedly free-ride in situations where many others contribute heavily, indicating they are willing to exploit cooperative environments for personal gain. At the same time, they also sometimes match or exceed the group’s cooperative stance with large or maximum contributions, showing they value or at least strategically support high public-good provision when they judge it worthwhile.\n\nThe instability in their giving suggests they are experimenting and reacting more than following a rigid fairness norm. They do not anchor on an equal-share or proportional contribution principle; at times they contribute less than most others when the group is generous, and at other times they contribute more than some peers when the group is mixed. This points to a flexible, payoff-sensitive mindset rather than a strong fairness-driven identity.\n\nTheir willingness both to contribute the maximum and to contribute nothing, even when the social environment looks broadly similar, indicates relatively high risk tolerance and a readiness to test extreme strategies. They appear comfortable with temporary exploitation but are not locked into pure defection; they seem to treat cooperation as a tool that can be switched on and off depending on perceived returns and perhaps on a desire to sustain or restore group cooperation.\n\nOverall, this type is best characterized as a payoff-oriented, strategically adaptive participant who conditionally cooperates when they believe it will sustain high collective returns, but who also frequently free-rides when the environment looks robust enough to tolerate their defection.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThe player remains willing to contribute substantial amounts in the final phase and does not converge to pure defection as the horizon approaches. They continue to mix low and higher contributions near the end, including multiple mid-to-high contributions when only a few rounds remain. This indicates clear awareness of the remaining number of rounds (as it is displayed) but no simple end-game collapse strategy.\n\nThere is no monotonic downward drift in contributions as the game approaches its final rounds; instead, the same pattern of conditional, volatile behavior persists. The player does not appear to treat the final round as a special opportunity for a last-moment exploit; they still contribute a nontrivial amount at the very end rather than dropping to zero. This suggests that their primary decision rule is not a backward-induction style “defect at the end and work backward,” but an ongoing evaluation of group context and payoffs that continues unchanged through the horizon.\n\nIn new environments, this implies that even in finite-horizon settings the player does not automatically defect in late rounds. They are likely to maintain a mixed cooperative strategy until the end, adjusting to perceived group behavior rather than sharply switching to all-out free-riding solely because the interaction is about to conclude."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is an opportunistic low contributor with sporadic high-cooperation spikes. Their average contribution is low relative to the endowment and to the group’s cooperative benchmarks, but they occasionally choose very high or full contributions. These high-input decisions are not stable; they appear as isolated experiments or brief cooperative bursts rather than a maintained norm.\n\nThey adjust contributions in response to the apparent cooperation level of others. When the group’s contributions look strong and widespread, they are willing to join with a substantial or even maximal contribution. When cooperation softens, fragments, or looks unreliable, they quickly revert to minimal giving and often free-ride on others’ efforts. This indicates conditional cooperation in principle, but with a strong self-serving tilt: they are more comfortable benefiting from others’ generosity than bearing the cost of trying to sustain it themselves.\n\nFairness norms appear weak and asymmetric. The player occasionally behaves “generously” and accepts very poor payoffs for themselves, suggesting they are not purely payoff-maximizing and that they understand and sometimes value the public good. However, those moves are not followed by persistence or clear attempts to stabilize a fair, high-contribution norm. Once they see that their own big contributions do not reliably elicit matching behavior or superior outcomes, they shift toward exploiting cooperative environments rather than sacrificing to improve them.\n\nRisk tolerance is situation-dependent. They are capable of high-risk cooperative moves that expose them to large relative losses when others don’t match, which implies some tolerance for strategic risk or experimentation. Yet over time, their contribution pattern converges toward low, low-variance contributions with occasional small deviations, consistent with a cautious, payoff-protective baseline. The combination suggests that they test bold strategies but quickly revert to safer free-riding when the social return is uncertain or disappointing.\n\nIn summary, this player is a conditional, self-protective cooperator: willing to invest heavily under certain perceived conditions but defaulting to low cooperation and strategic free-riding, with limited commitment to enforcing or upholding fairness norms.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThe player shows awareness of the game horizon and increasingly treats later decisions as low-responsibility opportunities to free-ride. While there is no clear monotonic decline across all later rounds, the closing phase is characterized by consistently low contributions, even when others remain substantially cooperative.\n\nIn the final set of rounds, the player still sometimes contributes small positive amounts, indicating they do not adopt a strict “always zero at the end” rule. However, the overall pattern is that, as the end approaches, they are more inclined to keep their endowment and let others shoulder the cost of maintaining the public good. They do not appear to use the last rounds to reward cooperators, repair norms, or send a prosocial signal; instead, they preserve their own payoff and accept benefiting from others’ final-round generosity.\n\nThis behavior is consistent with an end-game strategy that recognizes diminishing future interactions: when there is little or no prospect of future reciprocal gain, the player prioritizes immediate private returns over sustaining cooperation. Their cooperation thus decays in strategic terms: they still occasionally give a token amount, but the dominant end-game motive is payoff extraction rather than norm maintenance or fairness."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThe player is a moderately cooperative, payoff-sensitive conditional cooperator with sizeable free-riding tendencies. Their typical contribution sits in the mid range rather than at the extremes: they neither consistently exploit others by always giving nothing nor commit to strong unconditional cooperation. Contributions vary with the apparent cooperativeness of the group: when others appear to contribute more on average, they are willing to increase their own giving into the mid-to-high range; when others appear to contribute little, they pull back sharply or even drop to zero. This pattern indicates conditional cooperation anchored more on relative than absolute fairness: they seem comfortable contributing less than the highest contributors while still participating in the public good. They display clear responsiveness to payoffs—they sometimes experiment with higher contributions, but when these trials produce visibly lower payoffs for them relative to low-contribution rounds, they reduce later contributions. Their risk tolerance for being a “sucker” is limited; they rarely position themselves at the top of the contribution distribution for the group and often remain at or below the group mean. Over time, they maintain cooperation at a moderate level rather than escalating it, suggesting a preference for balancing earnings with some degree of group-oriented behavior.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThe player is aware of the finite horizon and exhibits a mild but clear end-game effect. In the middle and later stages, when cooperation in the group looks relatively strong, they are willing to contribute at or above their own typical mid-level, signaling that they do not immediately unravel cooperation as the final rounds approach. However, their final-round decision shows a decisive shift toward self-interest, with a contribution that is lower than their established mid-range tendency despite the presence of many cooperative peers. This indicates that, while they are willing to sustain cooperation close to the end when it seems profitable and socially supported, they ultimately prioritize maximizing their final payoff once there is no future interaction. The decay is not gradual and systematic from the midpoint onward; rather, it appears as a late-stage strategic drop that reflects horizon awareness and a willingness to free-ride when future repercussions are absent. Overall, they are an end-game defector who cooperates conditionally up to very near the end, then opportunistically withdraws contribution in the last opportunity."

They are willing to contribute the full endowment in most rounds, including when others are not fully cooperative, which suggests a pro-social or efficiency-oriented baseline rather than pure payoff maximization. However, they sometimes contribute nothing even when group contributions are reasonably high, indicating that they notice and exploit profitable free-riding opportunities rather than adhering to a rigid moral or fairness rule.\n\nTheir pattern shows some conditionality: they tend to contribute when they see broad cooperation and when they appear engaged with the game, but they also withhold contributions at times when others are contributing enough to sustain a good payoff or when contributions fluctuate. There is no evidence of strict reciprocity targeted at specific individuals; their shifts between contributing and not contributing do not consistently track any one peer’s behavior. Instead, their conditionality looks coarse and group-level: they are comfortable benefitting from the public good without contributing when they believe the group will still function.\n\nThey tolerate inequality when it favors them: they accept earning well above others’ average contribution levels when they free-ride, and they continue to contribute fully even after having benefitted from others’ cooperation in prior rounds. They do not protest others’ non-contributions, nor do they actively attempt to enforce fair shares, so fairness norms appear weak or at least secondary to maintaining flow and engagement.\n\nRisk tolerance is moderate to high regarding cooperation: they repeatedly contribute fully despite uncertainty about others’ future actions. They do not appear to systematically reduce contributions after low-return experiences; instead, they oscillate between cooperation and free-riding in a way that suggests either experimentation or a relaxed attitude toward payoff optimization. Over the game, their contributions stabilize at a high level, consistent with accepting the cooperative equilibrium as “good enough” even when not perfectly exploited for maximal private gain.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThe player’s communication is brief, informal, and socially oriented rather than explicitly strategic. They use light humor and mild impatience to comment on others’ speed and behavior, which positions them as engaged and socially aware but not strongly directive. Their comments focus on pacing and variety rather than explicit coordination about contribution levels.\n\nThey attempt very soft, indirect coordination by drawing attention to the tempo of play and joking about another player’s slowness, but they never make explicit proposals about everyone contributing or about norms for cooperation. This suggests low motivation to lead or organize formal agreements, and a preference for maintaining a casual atmosphere.\n\nThey respond to the emerging situation in chat: they echo another player’s impatience and then react with surprised enthusiasm when group cooperation improves, indicating that they pay attention to both outcomes and social signals. Their tone is playful and non-confrontational; even when they single out a slow player, the style is teasing rather than accusatory, and they never criticize non-contributors for free-riding. When they later remark on “mixing it up,” they frame contribution behavior as something to vary for interest rather than as a moral obligation or strategic plan.\n\nOverall, they engage in low-intensity social participation, using chat to express mood and react to events rather than to push a strong agenda. They show responsiveness to others’ messages but do not sustain extended dialogue or negotiation, suggesting a sociable but somewhat detached interaction style.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThe player shows no clear end-game defection pattern. As the remaining rounds decrease, they continue to contribute fully and do not shift toward systematic non-contribution, even when others intermittently reduce their contributions and when at least one peer openly questions the point of contributing. This indicates either limited attention to backward-induction logic, or a deliberate choice to sustain cooperation to the end despite the finite horizon.\n\nThey do not adjust their chat or behavior to the approaching final round in any obvious way: there is no visible attempt to rally last-minute cooperation, no threat of end-of-game free-riding, and no explicit acknowledgment of the horizon. Their strategy in late rounds is consistent with their mid-game cooperative mode rather than a distinct terminal strategy.\n\nGiven the absence of explicit horizon-aware comments and the persistence of high contributions all the way through, their end-game response is best characterized as horizon-insensitive cooperative persistence with occasional earlier free-riding that does not intensify as the game closes. Their behavior suggests that maintaining a simple, mostly cooperative pattern is more salient to them than exploiting the final rounds for maximum private gain."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a predominantly high contributor who occasionally experiments with free-riding. Their default action is to contribute fully, and they return to full contribution after short deviations. Contribution behavior is moderately stable rather than rigid: most decisions align with a cooperative norm, but there are a few deliberate switches to non-contribution even when others are still giving.\n\nThey appear conditionally cooperative in a loose, probabilistic way. When the group environment is clearly cooperative, they continue to contribute fully. When cooperation becomes patchy or some players hold back, they sometimes test defection. These tests are brief; they do not initiate a sustained collapse into full-time free-riding. This suggests they value the efficiency of the public good but are also sensitive to the temptation to exploit it.\n\nThey show some willingness to free-ride on others’ high contributions, but not in a purely exploitative pattern. Instead of consistently defecting when others are generous, they alternate between joining the cooperative majority and taking occasional advantage. This implies mixed motives: they care about payoff maximization but do not fully abandon cooperative norms.\n\nFairness norms are present but not strict or strongly enforced in their behavior. They do not consistently punish low contributors through retaliation (e.g., switching to 0 whenever others do), nor do they insist on perfect reciprocity. They tolerate a moderate level of inequality in contributions, continuing to contribute in many situations where others are not unanimous. At the same time, the intermittent zero contributions indicate at least some concern about not being the “sucker” who always pays while others benefit.\n\nRisk tolerance in contribution decisions appears moderate. The player often invests fully despite uncertainty about others’ behavior, indicating comfort with the risk of being exploited when group returns could be high. However, sporadic defections show that they hedge by occasionally locking in the private payoff and the redistributed share from others. Their pattern looks more like intuitive or experiential learning than strict payoff optimization.\n\nOverall, the contribution profile fits a “mostly cooperative but opportunistic tester” type: someone who prefers mutual cooperation, typically contributes fully, but periodically checks whether defecting yields better outcomes, then quickly drifts back toward cooperation.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThe player does not speak in chat at any point. They neither initiate messages nor respond directly to others’ comments or questions, even when another player explicitly references their contribution choices. This silence suggests a low-communication, observant style rather than an active coordinating or persuading role.\n\nTheir lack of verbal engagement persists despite a lively chat environment, where others encourage speed, joke, and comment on contribution choices. The silent stance can indicate several possible traits: social reticence, preference for non-verbal (action-based) communication, or strategic avoidance of social commitments that might constrain their flexibility in contributing. Exact motivation is unknown.\n\nThey also do not use chat defensively or justificatorily when another player questions a zero contribution. Instead, they “communicate” only through subsequent behavior (returning to contribution) rather than through explanation or argument. This suggests a tendency to adapt at the level of actions without engaging in explicit negotiation.\n\nThere are no signs of attempts to coordinate group strategies, enforce norms through language, or persuade defectors to contribute. They neither join in playful banter nor in explicit strategic discussion. This player can be characterized as a quiet participant who lets their contribution pattern, rather than their words, express their stance.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nAwareness of the game horizon is structurally present in the interface, but the player does not show a strong end-game defection spike. In the final segment of the game, they continue to contribute fully in most of the last rounds instead of switching to consistent free-riding.\n\nTheir behavior near the end is a mix of one late defection embedded within an otherwise cooperative finish. This pattern does not fit a textbook backward-induction strategy where cooperation collapses sharply as the last round approaches. Instead, they maintain substantial cooperation almost all the way through, including the final round.\n\nThis suggests that immediate horizon considerations do not dominate their strategy. They do not systematically exploit the last opportunities to defect even when there are no future rounds in which others could retaliate. Either they are not applying strict game-theoretic backward reasoning, or they place weight on internal norms or habits of cooperation that persist even when strategic incentives to cooperate are weakest.\n\nThe isolated late zero contribution appears more as a continuation of their earlier occasional testing of defection than as a specific response to the approaching end. There is no clear sign that they increase the frequency or intensity of free-riding solely because the game is ending. Their end-game profile is best described as “mostly stable cooperation with minor, non-escalating defection,” indicating limited sensitivity to the finite horizon and a tendency to preserve their existing behavioral pattern rather than radically revise it at the end."

They sometimes free-ride when overall cooperation appears unstable or when others explicitly question the point of contributing, yet they also continue to contribute fully in some mixed or partially uncooperative environments. This suggests a “weak conditional cooperator”: they are influenced by group behavior and talk, but they do not mechanically match the group average.\n\nThey appear to understand that high collective contributions are beneficial: when others contribute more, they respond positively and are willing to rejoin or sustain high contribution profiles. At the same time, they opportunistically exploit cooperative episodes by withholding their own contribution while benefiting from others’ efforts, showing a non-negligible self-interested streak and comfort with strategic free-riding.\n\nRisk tolerance is moderate. They are willing to risk contributing when others are unreliable, but they also hedge by sometimes choosing zero contributions even when cooperation is possible. Fairness concerns are present but not rigid: they do not visibly protest specific free-riders and occasionally take advantage of generous group behavior themselves, implying a pragmatic rather than moralistic approach to fairness.\n\nOverall, they sit between a pure cooperator and a pure free-rider: generally pro-cooperation, somewhat responsive to the social and strategic context, and prepared to deviate when cooperation seems fragile or “pointless.”\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThe player’s communication style is brief, sociable, and coordination-oriented. They engage in light, informal chat rather than remaining silent, and they direct at least one message toward motivating or cueing a slower or less responsive participant, suggesting a mild leadership or nudging tendency. They frame their prompts in a casual and humorous way rather than confrontationally, which points to a desire to keep the atmosphere friendly while still moving the game along.\n\nThey also respond positively when cooperation improves, using upbeat, inclusive language to reinforce a moment of high group contribution. This indicates they pay attention to shifts in group behavior and try to socially reward better coordination through tone rather than through any available sanction or reward mechanisms (which are absent here).\n\nThey do not explicitly criticize low contributors or threaten defection, and they do not engage in direct strategic persuasion (such as explaining payoffs or proposing binding agreements). Their engagement is low-to-moderate in volume but clearly indicates attentiveness to others’ pace and to the level of cooperation. They are responsive rather than domineering: they align their remarks with the unfolding chat and group state, suggesting a socially attuned but non-intrusive style.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nAwareness of the finite horizon does not lead this player to a clear, monotonic end-game defection pattern. In later rounds, they continue to alternate between full contributions and free-riding rather than moving decisively toward zero contributions as the game approaches its conclusion. They still contribute fully in the very last stage, indicating that they do not rigidly follow the standard backward-induction logic of full defection at the end.\n\nTheir later-round behavior remains contingent on perceived group cooperation and on the surrounding tone (“no point” type sentiments from others correlate with some of their defection choices), rather than directly on the countdown of remaining rounds. The horizon appears to be psychologically backgrounded: they know the game length from the interface, but their strategy continues to be driven more by current group behavior and chat signals than by time remaining.\n\nOverall, this player maintains a mixed, context-sensitive strategy through the end of the game. They neither escalate cooperation in a “last push” nor fully abandon it in classic end-game fashion, which suggests that in new PGG environments they are likely to carry their conditional, socially influenced contribution style all the way to the final rounds instead of sharply changing behavior simply because the game is ending."

After beginning as a pure defector, they shift into a pattern where they often match or exceed the group’s cooperative baseline but intermittently exploit cooperative periods by keeping their endowment. Contribution choices are binary and used flexibly rather than rigidly; they neither lock into always-give nor always-keep. They seem sensitive to whether “enough” others are contributing and are more willing to contribute when the broader environment is cooperative and somewhat stable. When others’ behavior becomes erratic or more selfish, they do not respond with a clear, consistent retaliation rule; instead, they sometimes keep contributing and other times free-ride, suggesting low but present concern for fairness and a stronger focus on personal payoff than on strict reciprocity.\n\nTheir strategy suggests they understand that contributing in a cooperative environment can be individually profitable, yet they are comfortable deviating to defection even when others are largely cooperative. They exhibit moderate risk tolerance: they are willing to contribute when others seem likely to cooperate, but they also periodically “test” how much they can gain by deviating. The pattern indicates they value both group efficiency and personal advantage, with the balance tilting toward self-interest when a one-shot gain is available and no punishment is present. Stability is medium: they show phases of sustained cooperation punctuated by isolated defections rather than random noise. They do not show strong commitment to equality of outcomes; they are willing to earn more than others when free-riding on their contributions.\n\n<COMMUNICATION>\nThe player does not send any chat messages. Their style is purely observational and non-verbal. They receive multiple social signals from others, including impatience, humor, and mild attempts to coordinate faster or more cooperative play, yet they never respond directly. This suggests a low-engagement or avoidant communication style: they do not use messages to persuade, negotiate, justify their actions, or enforce norms.\n\nDespite the silence, their behavior adjusts after periods when group members express a desire for coordination and higher contributions, implying that they register social cues but choose not to participate overtly. They appear to treat chat primarily as background information about group mood and likely behavior, not as a channel they themselves want to use. This muted presence can make them harder to read and holds down any social accountability that might come from promising or explaining their strategy. Overall, they are a quiet, reactive observer rather than an active conversational leader.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nAwareness of the finite horizon does not produce a simple monotonic end-game collapse in cooperation. In the late part of the game, the player alternates between cooperation and defection rather than clearly ramping down contributions. They do exploit some late opportunities to free-ride when others continue to cooperate, showing that they are willing to cash in on the absence of future repercussions. At the same time, they also continue to contribute in other late rounds, including the final one, even when a purely self-interested, backward-induction logic would predict consistent defection.\n\nThis pattern suggests that they understand the temptation to defect near the end and act on it intermittently, but they do not adhere to a strict end-game defection rule. Their behavior is better described as opportunistic than fully time-consistent: they look for profitable deviations but still maintain significant cooperative behavior up to and including the last round. The absence of punishment or reward mechanisms appears to make them comfortable taking advantage of cooperative others in select late rounds, but it does not completely erase their willingness to contribute. Their horizon sensitivity is thus present but moderate, producing fluctuating rather than steadily declining cooperation near the end."

Across essentially the entire game, they consistently choose the maximal contribution available rather than free-riding, even when others around them sometimes keep their endowment and receive higher payoffs.\n\nThey treat contribution as the default rather than as something to be calibrated round by round. Their behavior does not track short-term variations in group cooperation: they continue to fully contribute through periods where some others contribute nothing and reap higher individual payoffs. This indicates that they prioritize the efficiency and fairness of the public outcome over immediate relative gains.\n\nTheir cooperation style fits a “principled high contributor” more than a purely payoff-maximizing conditional cooperator. They appear willing to accept being exploited by intermittent free-riders as a cost of maintaining a high-contribution environment, at least as long as the overall group remains moderately cooperative.\n\nThe one clear deviation is an abrupt switch to zero contribution only at the very final opportunity, despite the group contributing fully. This pattern suggests that they understand the incentive structure and the finite horizon: they know that defection in the last interaction is individually profitable and cannot be disciplined in the future. They maintain cooperation up to that point either due to norm adherence, long-run payoff thinking, or both.\n\nGiven the high multiplier, their behavior is compatible with someone who recognizes that full contribution is socially efficient and likely also individually profitable if others mostly cooperate. Their persistent full contributions, even when nontrivial free-riding exists, suggest relatively low risk-aversion with respect to being exploited, and/or a strong preference for sustaining a cooperative norm rather than reacting defensively.\n\nOverall, they are best characterized as a cooperative, norm-oriented player who understands but largely resists the temptation to free-ride, yielding only at the very end when future interactions no longer matter.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThe player clearly exhibits horizon awareness: they maintain maximal cooperation through the entire finite horizon and then exploit the final round by withholding contribution while others continue to give fully.\n\nThey do not show any gradual decay of cooperation as the end approaches. Instead, their pattern is “all-cooperate until the last chance, then defect once.” This suggests that, in their internal reasoning, backward induction is applied only at the terminal point, not recursively extended to earlier rounds. They seem willing to preserve cooperative dynamics while there is any continuation value, even if the number of remaining rounds becomes small.\n\nThis late defection is not driven by observed collapse of group cooperation; it occurs when the group is actually at its most uniformly cooperative. That points to a deliberate, payoff-aware final-round strategy rather than a reactive response to others. It is consistent with a player who accepts cooperative norms during the repeated phase but views the last period as a permissible or even “rationally justified” moment to secure an individual bonus, given the absence of future repercussions.\n\nIn new environments, this suggests that the player is likely to uphold high cooperation until they perceive that the interaction is definitively ending and then consider opportunistic defection on the final move. If the horizon is uncertain or indefinite, their behavior is more likely to remain cooperative, since the clean “last round” anchor is absent.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThe player observes detailed information about others’ contributions and payoffs but shows no behavioral adjustment that mirrors short-term inequities. Even when some peers repeatedly earn more by not contributing, the focal player continues to fully contribute. This suggests a relatively low sensitivity to disadvantageous inequality in the short run, at least within the levels experienced here.\n\nThey do not appear to update their strategy in response to specific individuals’ behavior; their contribution pattern stays the same whether particular peers free-ride intermittently or the group is close to universally cooperative. This indicates that they are not using a tit-for-tat or “conditional on average contribution” rule in any fine-grained way, even though they could. Instead, they effectively follow a simple heuristic: maintain full cooperation throughout the repeated interaction, ignoring minor opportunism, and then exploit only the final, non-punishable opportunity.\n\nBecause no punishment or reward is available, we learn about their reaction to outcomes solely from their contribution choices. Their indifference to short-run exploitation implies tolerance and a willingness to absorb occasional unfair outcomes for the sake of a high public good level. They do not make visible efforts to discipline free-riders through reduced contributions, even when doing so would be individually understandable.\n\nIn sum, their response to others’ outcomes is muted and norm-maintaining during the repeated phase and becomes payoff-maximizing only at the terminal point, when others’ future responses are irrelevant."

However, they are not a pure defector; they regularly choose non-minimal contributions, sometimes relatively high ones. This mix suggests they balance personal earnings with some willingness to support group efficiency, rather than following a strict selfish or altruistic rule.\n\nTheir contribution pattern is volatile rather than fixed. They move between low and high contributions multiple times, indicating ongoing adjustment rather than a simple early decision.

This suggests a limited internal standard of “doing their share,” though that standard is inconsistent.\n\nRisk tolerance appears moderate. The player is willing to “invest” in the public fund in situations where they cannot predict exact future behavior of others but where recent evidence suggests a cooperative environment. At the same time, they often hedge by choosing mid-level contributions rather than always going to the maximum, signaling some caution about overexposure if others defect.\n\nOverall, the player is best described as a strategically adaptive, opportunistic cooperator: they exploit cooperative environments at times but also help sustain them once they trust that others are reliably contributing. Their cooperativeness is conditional, fluctuating with their assessment of the group’s behavior and their own payoff experience.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThe player is clearly aware of the finite horizon and does not follow a simple “cooperate to the end” rule. In the last several rounds, their contributions remain variable rather than monotonically declining or increasing. They sometimes contribute substantial amounts close to the end, but they also intersperse zero contributions, including in the final round.\n\nThere is no consistent pattern of escalating generosity or systematic end-game defection. Instead, their late-game behavior looks like a continuation of their earlier conditional style: they respond to the current cooperative climate more than to the abstract fact that the game is ending. When others remain relatively cooperative late in the game, the player is still willing to contribute non-trivially in some of those rounds, despite having no future rounds in which reputation or reciprocation can pay off. At the same time, they seize opportunities to free-ride near the end, including at the very last possible decision.\n\nThis combination suggests that horizon awareness is present but not dominant. The player does not appear to run a backward-induction strategy; instead, they treat late rounds largely like earlier ones, with slightly more readiness to defect opportunistically when the payoff from free-riding is salient. Their cooperation does not collapse entirely as the end approaches, but it becomes more selective and interspersed with full defection, consistent with an adaptive type that weighs immediate payoff opportunities more heavily than long-run relational concerns once the horizon is short."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is primarily a free-rider with occasional, short-lived switches to full contribution. Their baseline is to keep their entire endowment and live off others’ contributions, even when most others contribute. They only ever use the extreme options available (all or nothing) and show no gradual adjustment, suggesting simple heuristic play rather than fine-tuned optimization. Full contributions appear sporadically and do not persist even when others also contribute a lot, indicating that they do not strongly internalize a cooperative norm or aim for stable reciprocity. They tolerate benefiting from others’ generosity without matching it and do not appear concerned with aligning their behavior to group averages. Their risk tolerance regarding cooperation is low: when in doubt, they default to defection and prioritize immediate personal payoff over potential collective gain. Any cooperative moves seem exploratory or context-reactive rather than part of a sustained fairness norm. Their fairness preferences are weak or inconsistent: they sometimes join high-contribution environments but do not maintain that stance when it would require sacrificing their own payoff repeatedly.\n\n<PUNISHMENT>\nThey make relatively infrequent use of punishment and, when they do punish, it is light and isolated rather than part of a systematic enforcement strategy. There is no clear pattern of punishing low contributors versus high contributors; their punishment choices do not obviously track cooperative norms, defectors, or extreme punishers. They do not appear to engage in costly norm enforcement aimed at stabilizing cooperation, nor do they join group-wide punishment cascades. Their spending on punishment is modest overall, consistent with a preference to preserve their own payoffs rather than invest heavily in shaping others’ behavior. Motivationally, the limited and sporadic punishment suggests either mild expressive reactions (e.g., annoyance at being targeted or at seeming unfairness) or experimentation with the mechanism rather than deliberate deterrence. They are not vengeful in any obvious, sustained way and do not escalate punishment in response to others’ aggression. Selectivity and targeting rules are unclear (low-confidence: unknown); there is no strong evidence they systematically reward cooperators or sanction free-riders via punishment choices.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_PUNISHER>\nThey experience substantial punishment across the game but do not clearly retaliate against specific identified punishers, nor do they shift toward stable cooperation to appease them. When punished, their subsequent contributions generally remain low or revert to defection after brief cooperative excursions, suggesting limited compliance with punitive pressure. There is no consistent pattern of “hit back at whoever punished me” visible; their rare uses of punishment do not line up clearly with those who previously targeted them, at least at the coarse resolution available here. This indicates a relatively low retaliatory drive, or at least low willingness to spend on revenge. At the same time, they also do not respond with durable “forgiveness-and-cooperation” after being sanctioned; their cooperative switches are temporary and do not map cleanly onto punishments received, so any appeasement motive is weak or absent. Overall, they appear behaviorally resistant to social control via punishment: they absorb deductions and continue to prioritize self-benefit, with only short, inconsistent deviations toward cooperation.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey observe others repeatedly spending heavily on punishment and sometimes driving their own or others’ payoffs negative, yet they do not join these extremes. This suggests they notice but do not imitate costly moralistic or spiteful behavior. They seem content to let others bear the cost of enforcing or attacking, while they maintain a relatively payoff-protective stance. Very high punishment expenditures by others do not trigger a clear change in their own contribution level; they neither become significantly more cooperative to avoid becoming a target nor start punishing in solidarity with other punishers. Likewise, they do not clearly favor or protect consistent cooperators; they neither reward nor materially defend those who contribute a lot or suffer high deductions. Their reaction to others’ payoffs and punishment patterns is largely passive: they adapt contributions only weakly and remain focused on individual gain rather than on shaping group outcomes. Their beliefs about others (inferred from behavior) likely include the expectation that others will keep contributing or keep punishing each other regardless of the focal player’s own actions, leading them to treat the social environment as something to exploit rather than something to stabilize."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a “principled cooperator with occasional opportunism.” They treat full contribution as the default, repeatedly choosing the cooperative option despite mixed group behavior and without visible decay over time. Across most of the game they maintain a high, stable contribution level, suggesting they accept the social-efficiency logic of contributing even when some others free-ride. They show one clear deviation into free-riding early on, during a phase where others are contributing strongly, which indicates they are not a pure altruist; they are willing to exploit a cooperative environment at least once to test or benefit from it. However, they do not stick with this exploitative pattern, implying that free-riding is not their dominant strategy.\n\nTheir behavior appears only weakly conditional on short-term fluctuations in others’ contributions. They continue to cooperate even when a noticeable minority of players persistently contribute nothing. This points to relatively high tolerance for free-riding and a willingness to keep investing in the public good without requiring strict fairness. At the same time, they seem aware of contribution norms: they do not increase cooperation in response to others, but they avoid sustained deviation from the cooperative pattern themselves, which fits an internalized “I should do my part” norm more than a reactive tit-for-tat style.\n\nRisk-wise, they accept the risk of being exploited by low contributors repeatedly. There is no evidence of them trying to hedge by withdrawing contributions when cooperation falls. This suggests either a payoff-insensitive commitment to cooperation or a belief that long-run or group-level gains justify continued full contribution. Their one early defection indicates some payoff sensitivity, but their persistence in full contributions even afterward suggests that norm adherence or self-concept as “a cooperator” carries more weight than immediate material incentives.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThey do not exhibit a classic end-game unraveling of cooperation. Contributions remain at the cooperative level through the final rounds, with no late defection even when the horizon is very short. This indicates that knowledge of the remaining rounds does not substantially change their contribution behavior. They either discount the strategic logic of final-round free-riding or place higher value on maintaining a cooperative pattern to the end.\n\nTheir approach to the closing stages instead looks consistent and steady: they keep contributing fully despite knowing there is little time left to influence others’ future actions. This weakens the interpretation that their cooperation is primarily strategic or future-oriented and supports an interpretation of rule-based or identity-based cooperation (“I am a contributor regardless of stage of the game”). There is no sign that they attempt a last-moment payoff grab by suddenly free-riding, even though such a move would be highly profitable and unpunishable here. Thus, horizon awareness is present but does not translate into opportunistic behavior; they seem to prioritize internal consistency over end-game optimization.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey are “selective but willing rewarder,” using the reward mechanism intermittently rather than systematically. They clearly accept the idea of paying a personal cost to benefit others, but they do not reward every round and sometimes choose not to reward even when others are cooperating. This pattern suggests that they treat rewarding as a targeted tool rather than a standing obligation.\n\nThey appear to use rewards primarily to reinforce cooperation and possibly to reciprocate when they themselves are being rewarded. Their largest reward expenditures coincide with periods when they are receiving substantial rewards, consistent with a gratitude or generalized reciprocity motive: when they feel supported by the group, they are more willing to incur sizeable costs to support others. In contrast, when no rewards flow to them, they become more conservative in rewarding, sometimes not using the mechanism at all. This asymmetry points to an underlying conditional preference: they like reciprocity and mutual support, and their willingness to bear costs for others increases when they perceive themselves as beneficiaries of the group.\n\nThey do not appear to use rewards as a strict, fine-grained enforcement tool—there is no clear evidence of them carefully rewarding only perfect cooperators and withholding from marginal ones in a consistent way. Instead, their pattern fits a looser, emotionally or norm-driven reinforcement: reward is used in bursts and then dialed back, more like a signal of appreciation or solidarity than an optimized incentive scheme. They also never experiment with extremely high or zero reward levels for extended stretches, implying a moderate, balanced orientation rather than extreme generosity or extreme self-interest. Overall, they are cooperative in both contribution and reward domains, but their rewarding is more context-sensitive and reciprocity-driven than their near-constant willingness to contribute."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a generally high contributor who starts off as a near-unconditional cooperator and then becomes a selective, moderately selfish conditional cooperator. Early on, they reliably give the full or near-full endowment, even when others include some clear low contributors. Over time, they begin to adjust downward in response to declining group contributions and visible free-riding, shifting to mid-range contributions and occasionally low-to-mid levels. They never move to outright zero contributions, even when the group’s average falls sharply, suggesting they maintain some baseline pro-social or norm-following tendency rather than fully defecting.\n\nTheir pattern indicates conditionality: when the group is broadly cooperative, they match or exceed the group; when cooperation erodes, they partially protect their own payoff while still putting some amount into the public account. The adjustments are not highly volatile from round to round; instead, they make relatively infrequent, step-like changes that appear to respond to sustained changes in group behavior rather than single outliers. This suggests they track overall cooperation rather than reacting instantly to every deviation.\n\nThey seem tolerant of some inequality and free-riding but not indefinitely. They continue contributing substantially while others oscillate, then cut back once it becomes clear that both high and low contributions coexist and that some players consistently earn high payoffs at low cost. Their willingness to continue giving something even in very low-contribution environments indicates either an internal fairness or “ought to contribute something” norm, or a risk-averse preference for not being one of the worst contributors relative to others. Overall, they fit a “pragmatic high contributor who downshifts when exploited but does not fully defect” profile.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThe player is horizon-aware but does not sharply unravel cooperation. In later rounds, contributions decrease on average compared to their early-game maximum, but this decline begins well before the final round and appears more tied to observed group behavior than to the countdown alone. Near the very end, with only a few rounds remaining and others increasingly mixing high and very low contributions, they do not escalate cooperation to a final-round “gift” and do not drop to zero either. Instead, they choose modest positive contributions, staying in the game cooperatively but protecting their own payoff.\n\nThere is no evidence that they attempt last-round signalling or “legacy building” through an all-in contribution. Likewise, there is no clear last-round opportunistic crash where they fully exploit the public good. Their end-game behavior is consistent with a learned adjustment: by that point they treat the environment as unstable and partially uncooperative and respond with moderate self-protection, rather than with a dramatic strategic shift triggered specifically by the terminal round.\n\n<REWARD>\nThey never spend any coins on rewards. This is consistent and unconditional across cooperative and uncooperative environments. They therefore behave as a pure non-rewarder in this institution: they do not use rewards to encourage high contributors, to reciprocate kindness, to build coalitions, or to thank people who reward them.\n\nThis pattern holds despite them personally contributing a lot and despite the presence of multiple players who visibly spend heavily to reward cooperators. They experience the reward system as a recipient but never activate it themselves. This could be driven by a monetary focus (they see no net payoff advantage to spending on rewards, since the tech is neutral), by a preference not to intervene socially, or by skepticism that rewards effectively steer group behavior. From the data alone, the motivation is unknown; what is clear is that they consistently prioritize keeping their own payoff over paying to influence others, even in situations where peers heavily reward high contributors.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThey are repeatedly rewarded by several others, including in periods where they contribute at or near the group maximum. However, they do not reciprocate with rewards: they neither reward those who reward them nor switch to rewarding any others after receiving rewards. There is no instance where a new reward-giving action appears after they have been rewarded, nor any change in their contribution behavior that clearly corresponds to having been rewarded.\n\nTheir cooperative behavior appears driven mainly by their own assessment of group contributions and payoff structure, not by gratitude toward specific rewarders. Being rewarded does not induce targeted reciprocity, alliance formation, or differentiated treatment of particular players. The player therefore acts as a “reward-insensitive cooperator”: they accept the additional earnings but do not treat rewards as social currency to be repaid. Any internal feeling of appreciation or obligation is unknown, but behaviorally, they do not engage in reciprocal reward exchanges.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey observe a wide range of others’ outcomes: some players contribute high and also spend on rewards, others contribute low and receive no social sanction, and some earn very high payoffs through minimal contributions plus received rewards or through saving both contributions and reward costs. Over time, they adjust their own contributions downward in a way that is broadly consistent with responding to perceived exploitation and payoff disparities.\n\nSpecifically, as they see persistent patterns where certain players free-ride or under-contribute yet still earn strong payoffs (often because others reward liberally), they reduce their own cooperative level but do not completely withdraw. This suggests they are sensitive to the fairness of the outcome distribution and are unwilling to indefinitely subsidize what looks like an inefficient or inequitable system. However, they stop short of punitive behavior: they do not use rewards to counteract inequality (e.g., by selectively boosting only generous players), nor do they have access to punishment, so they simply adjust their own provision rate.\n\nThey also do not chase the highest possible payoff by mimicking the most selfish strategies. When others drop to very low contributions and still do well, the player responds only partially; they preserve some level of contribution that keeps them aligned with a minimum cooperation standard. Overall, they monitor others’ contributions and payoffs, react to sustained low cooperation or reward distortions by reducing their own generosity, but remain reluctant to adopt extreme free-riding or to spend resources manipulating others’ incentives."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a mid-to-high but flexible contributor who treats contribution as a strategic lever rather than a fixed moral rule. They commonly choose intermediate contributions around the middle of the endowment, occasionally moving to very high contributions and sometimes downshifting to low ones. These changes align with shifts in group cooperation levels: when others are generally contributing a lot, the player often increases their own contribution; when group contributions or the implied norm weaken, they are willing to reduce theirs. They do not insist on perfectly matching the group average but seem comfortable being somewhat below or above it depending on context. They show no sign of extreme risk-taking or pure free-riding; instead, they balance earning with maintaining some level of group provision. Their behavior suggests a conditional cooperator guided by rough fairness norms—willing to be generous when the environment supports cooperation but not sacrificing unconditionally when others backslide.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nAwareness of the finite horizon does not produce a simple monotonic decay in contributions. Near the end, the player alternates between high and low contributions rather than sliding steadily downward. They still make some of their largest contributions late, but also exhibit low contributions in other late rounds, indicating that immediate group behavior and recent history matter more than the abstract fact that the game is ending. There is no clear last-round collapse into pure defection: they still contribute nontrivially at the very end. This pattern is consistent with someone who understands that the game is finite but continues to respond to the current cooperative climate rather than following a strict backward-induction logic.\n\n<REWARD>\nThe player uses rewards sparingly and selectively. Across the game, they sometimes spend on rewards and sometimes refrain entirely, even when others are rewarding actively. When they do reward, it appears targeted toward relatively cooperative peers rather than toward low contributors. They do not use reward as a large-scale coordination tool or as a persistent, costly signal; instead, they occasionally reinforce positive behavior but treat reward coins as resources to be conserved. Their spending never approaches the extremes seen in some other players, suggesting moderate willingness to pay for prosocial reinforcement but a clear limit on how much they will sacrifice. They do not attempt to micromanage others’ behavior with fine-grained or frequent rewards; their style is restrained and intermittent.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThe player receives rewards in several rounds from others, but their own subsequent reward behavior does not strongly track who rewarded them. They neither engage in obvious one-to-one reciprocity nor form a visible “reward alliance” with any particular partner. Being rewarded does not trigger a large or consistent increase in their own rewarding, nor a special favoritism toward apparent benefactors. Likewise, they do not retaliate against the absence of rewards by withdrawing cooperation toward specific individuals; their contribution decisions respond more to overall group contribution patterns than to personal reward histories. This points to weak direct reciprocity in the reward channel: they may experience rewards as pleasant or affirming but do not reorganize their strategy around reciprocal gift-giving.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThe player appears to monitor others’ contributions and payoffs enough to adjust their own behavior, but they do not react in an emotionally extreme way to others’ outcomes. They coexist with both very heavy reward spenders and more self-interested players without aggressively imitating or opposing either pattern. As some players repeatedly burn large amounts of coins to reward, the focal player does not escalate their own reward spending to match, nor do they dramatically cut their contributions in response to others gaining high payoffs through low contributions. Instead, they adjust moderately: raising or lowering contributions in line with broad shifts in group cooperation, while keeping reward use limited. They seem tolerant of payoff inequality and others’ idiosyncratic strategies, focusing on maintaining a reasonable personal payoff rather than enforcing strong norms via reward. Overall, they behave as a pragmatic conditional cooperator: attentive to the cooperative environment, responsive to group-level signals, but cautious and measured in the use of costly social tools."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a high, near-unconditional contributor for most of the game. They usually give the full endowment and appear to treat full contribution as the “default” cooperative norm, even when others’ average contributions fluctuate and sometimes fall well below their own. Their behavior suggests they value sustaining group cooperation and are willing to accept personal payoff risk to do so. \n\nThey do not perfectly follow a “simple conditional cooperator” pattern; they continue contributing fully through periods when average contributions drop and when some group members repeatedly free-ride. However, they are not completely rigid. Mid- and late-game, they introduce a few lower contributions, including one sharp reduction, which indicates some sensitivity to the emerging norm and to the diminishing horizon. These deviations are limited and do not escalate into systematic defection; instead, they look like occasional payoff-protecting moves rather than a full abandonment of cooperation.\n\nOverall, they hold a strong fairness/cooperation norm, tolerate substantial exploitation for many rounds, and only modestly adjust downward when group contributions and the end-game timing make full cooperation less attractive.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThe player is clearly aware of the finite horizon and allows it to influence contribution decisions, but only in a restrained way. Near the end, they reduce contributions in some rounds while still maintaining at least moderate giving and even returning to full contribution in the penultimate round. In the final round, they contribute minimally, consistent with standard end-game defection logic. \n\nThis pattern suggests they balance two motives: maximizing final earnings and maintaining a cooperative identity. They do not “unravel” cooperation early; instead, they hold high contributions until late and then selectively defect at the very end, when future reciprocity is impossible. The presence of occasional earlier reductions indicates that they also react to accumulating evidence of others’ opportunism and to decaying overall cooperation, but they do not drive that decay.\n\n<REWARD>\nThe player never pays to reward anyone, despite having repeated opportunities and clearly observable cooperative peers. This is stable across early, middle, and late rounds. Their restraint is not driven by lack of cooperative partners: several group members contribute highly and are actively rewarding others, yet the player still refrains from spending.\n\nGiven that each reward unit is payoff-neutral by design, their refusal to reward indicates a strong cost-avoidance or frugality norm regarding “extra” prosocial expenditures, rather than a misunderstanding of the mechanism. They appear to treat contribution as their main cooperative lever and are unwilling to incur additional direct costs, even to support high contributors or to solidify alliances.\n\nThey therefore exhibit a “cooperative but non-rewarding” type: they provide the public good generously but do not invest in formal positive reciprocity mechanisms.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nThe player receives rewards in many rounds, often from consistent high-contribution rewarders, but they never reciprocate with reward. There is no evidence of targeted payback to those who reward them, nor of strategic alliance-building via mutual reward exchange. Their contributions remain high regardless of who rewarded them, indicating that they do not condition their giving on being personally recognized or favored.\n\nThis pattern points to weak or absent gratitude signaling through the available reward channel. If gratitude or appreciation exists, it does not translate into costly reciprocation. Instead, they maintain a largely one-dimensional cooperative strategy: contribute a lot, ignore the reward system as an active tool, and continue cooperating independently of whether specific others treat them well. This is consistent with a principled or norm-based cooperator who is behaviorally stubborn and not very relationally strategic.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThe player observes wide variation in others’ contributions, reward spending, and payoffs. They see some players spend heavily on rewards, some systematically reward high contributors, and others free-ride or sharply reduce contributions. Despite this, they show minimal behavioral reactivity in either direction. High reward expenditures by peers do not inspire them to start rewarding, and persistent low contributions by certain members only gradually and mildly reduce their own contributions, mostly later in the game.\n\nThey also witness others burning considerable payoff on rewarding, sometimes inefficiently, yet they do not imitate this pattern. This suggests they infer that such spending is not necessary for their own objectives. They appear payoff-conscious with respect to side-payments: they let others bear the extra cost of “policing” or reinforcing cooperation while they stick to contribution decisions alone.\n\nTaken together, the player seems to interpret others’ outcomes and choices mainly as a loose signal about the group’s cooperative climate—adjusting contributions slightly when overall cooperation erodes and the end approaches—but does not engage in fine-grained, actor-specific responses. Their type is that of a robust, norm-driven high contributor who is strategically cautious about additional costs, relatively indifferent to the social signaling and alliance benefits of rewards, and only modestly adaptive to others’ evolving behavior."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a generally high contributor who leans cooperative even when others free‑ride. They often give close to or at the full endowment, with only occasional reductions. These lower contributions appear more like mild shading in response to deteriorating group cooperation or end‑game position than a switch to full free‑riding. They do not match others’ low contributions closely; instead, they maintain contributions above the group’s minimum tendency, suggesting an internal norm of “should contribute fairly a lot” rather than strict payoff maximization. Their behavior indicates moderate risk tolerance: they keep contributing substantially despite weak assurance that others will do the same. Conditionality is present but soft—when the public contribution level drops or becomes erratic, they reduce somewhat, yet they never exploit very high group contributions by sharply under‑contributing. Fairness norms seem pro‑social: they appear more willing to risk being the sucker than to risk dragging the public good down.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nAwareness of the finite horizon does not trigger a collapse to zero cooperation. In later rounds, they do trim contributions relative to their own earlier highs, but they remain a positive contributor even when others start dropping. This pattern suggests that the player understands that payoffs are declining and cooperation is becoming less reliable, yet they continue to treat the interaction as worth sustaining. There is no strong last‑round defection spike; instead they end with a moderate contribution when many others severely cut back or drop to near zero. This implies that they either discount backward‑induction logic or prioritize norm consistency and “how I play” over strict end‑game payoff optimization. Their behavior is consistent with someone who values maintaining a cooperative identity through to the end more than squeezing out maximal final‑round earnings.\n\n<REWARD>\nThis player is a very heavy and persistent rewarder. They spend substantial portions of their payoff on rewarding others across many rounds, often at levels that noticeably erode their own earnings. They continue to reward even when returns to doing so are weak or one‑sided from the standpoint of their own payoffs. The triggers for reward are primarily prosocial behavior: they direct rewards most strongly toward high or reliable contributors and seldom, if ever, toward very low contributors. They appear to target players who either consistently support the public good or who step up in otherwise low‑contribution environments. The pattern indicates that they use reward as a normative signal rather than as a tightly optimized investment. They seem willing to “overpay” to support or encourage cooperators, and they maintain this generosity through both good and bad contribution climates. There is no evidence of them withdrawing rewards in systematic retaliation for low contributions; instead, they tend to simply omit reward for weak contributors rather than spending strategically to reshape them.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nWhen others reward them, they do not strongly pivot their strategy toward direct reciprocity. Though they do receive rewards from several peers, there is no clear pattern of them selectively increasing reward back to those same individuals relative to similarly cooperative others. Their reward behavior remains broad‑based and anchored more on contribution patterns than on who has personally transferred coins to them. This points to low emphasis on personalized alliances or tit‑for‑tat relationships and higher emphasis on group‑level norms. Being rewarded does not induce extreme shifts in their own contribution levels, suggesting that they see rewards more as confirmation that cooperation is valued than as contingent bargains that must be immediately repaid. If they ever do reciprocate specific rewarders more than others, it is subtle and not systematic enough to infer confidently. Overall, they behave more like a principled prosocial rewarder than a coalition‑builder or reputation trader.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThey track others’ contributions and outcomes and respond in ways that prioritize supporting high contributors and visible cooperators. Players whose payoffs are high because they both contribute and are rewarded by others often also receive this player’s reward, indicating a tendency to align with perceived “good citizens” of the group. They show little inclination to target players who already earn very high payoffs through low contributions plus others’ generosity; instead, they generally avoid rewarding clear free‑riders, even when those free‑riders’ outcomes are strong. When the overall group payoff environment deteriorates, they pull back slightly on contributions but often continue spending substantially on rewarding the remaining cooperators, implying that they are sensitive to others’ costs and are willing to shore up those who continue to bear a burden for the public good. They appear to accept personally lower payoffs as a consequence of this stance. There is no evidence of spite or envy toward high earners; their adjustments are about contribution behavior, not simply relative income. Consequently, their type is best described as a norm‑driven, inequality‑tolerant cooperator who uses reward as a costly signal of approval and encouragement rather than as a strict instrument of personal gain."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a moderate, flexible cooperator with clear conditional tendencies and some opportunism. They rarely choose extremes; most of the time they contribute an intermediate share of their endowment rather than all or nothing. Their baseline pattern is to give a stable, mid-level amount when the group appears broadly cooperative and outcomes are good.\n\nThey adjust contributions in response to the observed environment. When others’ contributions are high and fairly uniform, they are willing to stay in the cooperative range or even temporarily increase their own contribution sharply. When they see contributions drop, become more uneven, or when there is visible free-riding or volatility, they reduce their own contributions substantially, sometimes to very low levels. This indicates conditional cooperation rather than rigid adherence to a fixed norm.\n\nThey show no strict “fair split” norm relative to the group average: they sometimes contribute below what many peers give while still accepting the benefits of the public pool. At the same time, they never commit to completely exploiting others for many consecutive rounds, and they do occasionally choose relatively high or full contributions even after periods of partial free-riding. This mix suggests they care about payoff security and efficiency, but not about strict equity.\n\nRisk-wise, they are willing to risk higher contributions when past environments look cooperative and rewards circulate, but they do not sustain that risk if they perceive instability. They seem more payoff-sensitive than principle-driven but avoid the most aggressive free-riding, maintaining a “moderate contributor who adjusts to the climate” profile.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThe player appears end-game aware and willing to decouple from cooperative norms as the horizon approaches. Contributions fluctuate more in later rounds, including both notably high and very low contributions. The absence of future repercussions seems to free them to alternate between cooperative and self-serving moves depending on recent signals.\n\nThey do not display a monotonic decline in contributions typical of pure backward induction; instead, they mix opportunistic under-contribution with occasional large contributions even quite late. This pattern suggests they recognize the limited remaining rounds but still respond to the immediate contribution context rather than treating the end-game purely as a period for exploitation. Overall, they show some cooperation decay and greater volatility near the end, consistent with horizon awareness but moderated by conditional responsiveness.\n\n<REWARD>\nThis player is an active but selective user of rewards early and mid-game, and almost entirely withdraws from rewarding later on. When they do spend on rewards, they usually allocate a small number of units and target individuals whose contribution levels are relatively high or at least in the cooperative range. They do not spend on low contributors or clear free-riders. This indicates a pro-social reinforcement motive: they use rewards to signal approval of cooperation, not to subsidize non-cooperators.\n\nThey are sensitive to personal cost: they never escalate into the extreme reward-spending levels seen in some peers, and over time they systematically reduce reward spending and eventually stop using it in many later rounds. This suggests that the player learns that heavy rewarding is not personally profitable or that cooperation is sufficiently stabilized (or fragile) that further rewarding is not worth the expense.\n\nTheir reward strategy is simple and rule-like: “reward decent or high contributors a little, especially when the group looks cooperative,” rather than highly fine-tuned or relational. They do not appear to use rewards to manage complex coalitions or to bargain; instead, they treat reward as a limited tool for supporting group cooperation under favorable conditions.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_REWARDER>\nWhen this player receives reward, their behavior shows little evidence of strong direct reciprocity toward specific benefactors. They do not respond with obvious targeted reward-back patterns, nor do they appear to single out particular partners for special treatment afterwards. Any reciprocity, if present, is weak or highly diffuse and thus indistinguishable from their general tendency to reward cooperators.\n\nThey do not dramatically increase contributions after being rewarded, nor do they sustain high contributions solely due to recognition. Their main drivers remain the overall contribution environment and payoff structure rather than personal gratitude. They tolerate receiving relatively little reward compared to some high contributors and do not visibly react by retaliating (via withdrawal of reward) against generous peers who fail to reward them. This points to low emphasis on interpersonal score-keeping and alliance-building, and higher emphasis on aggregate patterns of cooperation.\n\nOverall, the player treats reward received as pleasant but non-binding; it does not appear to fundamentally alter their strategy.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_OTHERS_OUTCOME>\nThis player pays attention to others’ contributions and reward behavior and adjusts accordingly, but in a coarse-grained, pattern-based manner rather than with fine discrimination. They increase or maintain moderate contributions when many others contribute generously and when reward activity is widespread, indicating that broad cooperative climates encourage them. When they observe more uneven or declining contributions, or when some players free-ride while others still give a lot, they are quick to scale down their own contributions, suggesting aversion to being exploited and sensitivity to group-level fairness.\n\nThey do not visibly punish via reward withdrawal at the individual level; instead, their reactions look aggregate: when the group as a whole seems less cooperative or more chaotic (some giving very little, some over-rewarding), they reduce both contributions and use of reward. They also appear unresponsive to extreme patterns of others burning payoff on very high reward expenditures; such costly signaling by others does not entice them into matching that intensity.\n\nThey seem more concerned with their own payoff trajectory and broad norms of cooperation than with specific individuals’ round payoffs or net earnings. High or low payoffs for others only matter to them insofar as they reflect or predict future contribution behavior. Socially, this corresponds to a cautious, efficiency-minded conditional cooperator who is willing to support cooperators but will not sacrifice heavily to correct or counteract others’ outcomes."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a predominantly high contributor who occasionally free‑rides when conditions look especially favorable or when others already provide ample public good. After an initial exploratory defection, the player most often chooses to contribute fully, suggesting that they recognize the social efficiency of contributing and generally align with a cooperative norm. Their contribution pattern is not perfectly stable: they intersperse a few zero contributions among many full contributions, indicating some strategic opportunism rather than unconditional altruism.\n\nThey appear conditionally cooperative in a loose, aggregate sense: when the surrounding environment looks broadly cooperative, they usually continue to contribute, and brief deviations to zero do not lead to a sustained collapse of their own cooperation. However, they do not seem to condition finely on each individual peer’s past behavior; instead, they treat the group as a whole and maintain high contributions even when several specific others repeatedly contribute nothing. Fairness norms seem present but weakly enforced: the player tolerates the presence of persistent free‑riders without systematically withdrawing their own cooperation or engaging in tit‑for‑tat patterns. Risk tolerance is moderate: they are willing to incur substantial contribution and, at times, nontrivial reward costs even when returns are uncertain, but they also occasionally protect their private payoff by defecting when the group appears able to sustain high total contributions without them.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nAwareness of the finite horizon does not provoke a standard end‑game unraveling for this player. They continue to contribute fully through the final stretch and do not display a monotonic decline in cooperation as the last round approaches. Their sporadic defections appear scattered rather than concentrated at the end; there is no clear evidence of a calculated final‑round exploitation of the group. The player instead maintains a generally cooperative stance to the conclusion, suggesting either that they discount backward induction, prioritize consistency of behavior, or place value on internal norms of cooperation over short‑term final‑period gains. Any subtle adjustment of strategy specifically in response to the remaining number of rounds is unknown or at best low‑confidence.\n\n<REWARD>\nThis player is willing to use the reward mechanism, but only intermittently and in a targeted way. They do not reward every round; instead, they deploy rewards in a few episodes, sometimes at noticeable personal cost. This indicates a readiness to sacrifice private coins to support or signal approval of cooperative behavior, consistent with a pro‑social or norm‑reinforcing inclination. They do not appear to reward themselves (not possible in this design) and cannot target others individually in the record provided, so expectations about specific recipient choices are unknown. However, the timing of their reward spending tends to align with environments that are already somewhat cooperative rather than with punitive or corrective attempts in very low‑contribution contexts, suggesting that they use rewards more as positive reinforcement than as rescue attempts in failing groups.\n\nTheir own receipt of substantial rewards in at least one episode does not obviously change their subsequent willingness to reward: they neither become consistently generous nor systematically withdraw from rewarding thereafter. This points to a relatively stable but selective reward orientation rather than a reactive gratitude‑driven spree. Overall, they function as a conditional rewarder who reinforces cooperation when it seems efficacious, but who is not committed to continuous costly encouragement and remains attentive to their own payoff."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player is a mixed but cooperation-leaning contributor who alternates between full cooperation and full free-riding, rather than settling into a single stable pattern. They always choose one of the extremes (all or nothing) and never use intermediate amounts when not constrained, suggesting a tendency to think in binary terms about “cooperate vs defect” rather than fine-tuning.\n\nThey frequently match or slightly exceed the group’s prevailing cooperation level, indicating conditional cooperation: when others appear largely cooperative, they are willing to contribute fully; when they sense enough cooperation from others and/or feel they can safely free-ride without obvious backlash, they withhold their own contribution. They do not insist on strict fairness in the sense of always matching others’ average contribution; instead, they seem comfortable alternating between periods of bearing more of the cooperative burden and periods of exploiting the group benefit while contributing nothing.\n\nThey show no clear upward or downward trend across the game: their contribution choices fluctuate in response to the environment, but do not steadily escalate or decay. This suggests they are responsive rather than myopically selfish or rigidly altruistic. They tolerate personal payoff losses in some instances in order to maintain or support group provision (cooperating even when many others do not), but they also take advantage of cooperative environments when they sense they can do so.\n\nRisk-wise, they accept the risk that cooperation may not be rewarded in any given round. They continue to contribute fully even after instances where their cooperation has not clearly improved their own payoff. This indicates some baseline willingness to act prosocially independent of immediate, guaranteed personal gain, though they temper this with intermittent free-riding, which keeps them from being a pure altruist.\n\nOverall, their contribution persona is: a conditional but somewhat forgiving cooperator who oscillates strategically between full cooperation and opportunistic defection, without strong insistence on strict equality of effort.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThe player shows horizon awareness in the sense that they know how many rounds remain, but they do not engage in a classic end-game collapse of cooperation. In the final stretch, they continue to choose full contributions frequently rather than systematically shifting to pure free-riding as the game nears conclusion.\n\nTheir late-game behavior is consistent with their earlier pattern: they remain willing to contribute fully when others are mostly cooperative and do not appear to change strategy purely because the game is about to end. There is no evidence of deliberate “last-round exploitation” where they abruptly defect after a history of cooperation. Instead, they maintain approximately the same mix of cooperative and non-cooperative decisions.\n\nThis suggests that their decision rule is anchored more in the contemporaneous pattern of others’ behavior and their own underlying preferences than in backward induction about future opportunities. They either do not prioritize maximizing terminal wealth via last-round defection, or they do not fully apply that logic in practice. Their response to the end game is thus characterized by relative stability of cooperative tendencies rather than strategic unraveling.\n\n<REWARD>\nThe player is actively willing to use the reward mechanism and does so multiple times, but not in every round. They never spend extremely large amounts on rewards, yet they are prepared to incur a meaningful personal cost to transfer benefits to others, showing a willingness to pay to support or encourage certain behaviors.\n\nTheir rewarding is selective and appears contingent on perceived cooperative norms rather than random generosity. They do not automatically reward every time the group cooperates, nor do they always refrain when the group is less cooperative. Instead, they occasionally invest in rewards when the environment seems to justify reinforcing cooperation or when they may be reciprocating benefits they themselves have received. Because rewarders are not identifiable, any use of the mechanism by this player cannot be designed to build a direct reputation with specific individuals; rather, it serves as an anonymous norm-enforcement or group-level signal. Nonetheless, they still spend on rewards at a personal cost, indicating intrinsic or strategic value they place on supporting cooperation even without direct attribution.\n\nThey also accept rewards from others when they arrive, and their subsequent behavior shows that receiving rewards does not immediately cause them to free-ride more aggressively; they sometimes continue to cooperate after benefiting. This is consistent with at least partial reciprocity or gratitude-like responding, though attribution is impossible in this setup, so any such reciprocity is diffuse rather than targeted.\n\nStrategically, they do not rely exclusively on rewards as their main tool: they alternate between rewarding and not rewarding while also varying their own contributions. This points to a nuanced approach in which rewards are one instrument among several for balancing personal gains and the maintenance of a cooperative environment. Overall, their reward persona is that of a moderate, selective rewarder who is willing to incur some cost to encourage or sustain cooperation, but who does not treat rewarding as an unconditional duty."

        "text": "<CONTRIBUTION>\nThis player fits a “hyper-cooperative but erratic reciprocator with occasional free-riding” profile. They are generally willing to contribute fully to the public good and appear to treat full contribution as their default choice. Across the game, they alternate between full cooperation and full defection rather than using intermediate or mixed patterns, suggesting a simple, binary heuristic rather than fine-tuned optimization.\n\nTheir cooperation is not unconditional. They sometimes free-ride even when most others contribute fully, showing that they do not rigidly follow a fairness or equality norm. They appear comfortable benefiting from others’ contributions without always matching them, especially after periods of intense rewarding, which indicates some sensitivity to their own payoff or fatigue with bearing multiple costs at once.\n\nAt the same time, they repeatedly return to full contribution after free-riding episodes, even when the group includes some consistent non-contributors. This tendency indicates a strong underlying cooperative inclination and relatively high tolerance for being exploited. They are not strongly deterrable by the presence of defectors; they seem oriented toward sustaining group cooperation rather than strictly protecting themselves.\n\nTheir behavior suggests limited conditionality: they do not finely track who is cooperative versus not, and they do not sharply reduce contributions in direct proportion to defection. Instead, they seem to use coarse adjustments: periods of sustained full cooperation, occasional switches to full free-riding, then reversion to cooperation. This pattern is consistent with a player who values cooperation and the public good but is also somewhat impulsive or experimental, occasionally testing free-riding or taking payoff relief after high-cost rewarding episodes.\n\nRisk-wise, they exhibit a moderate willingness to accept potential exploitation: they often contribute fully in groups with visible defectors and without any punishment mechanism, implying that they either expect enough others to cooperate to make contribution attractive or that they intrinsically prefer the cooperative action even under uncertainty. However, free-riding intervals show they are not purely idealistic; they are aware of and sometimes act on the individual incentive to keep their endowment.\n\nOverall, they are a high-cooperation, somewhat volatile contributor who oscillates between pro-social commitment and opportunistic relief, but without a strong, precise contingent strategy.\n\n<RESPONSE_TO_END_GAME>\nThe player shows no clear evidence of classic end-game defection. They continue to employ full contributions through the final stretch of the game and do not shift into a systematic “last-round” free-riding mode. In the final rounds, they remain willing to contribute fully even when others are not all cooperating, suggesting that horizon effects do not strongly undermine their cooperative tendency.\n\nThere is some fluctuation near the end, but it does not follow a simple “cooperation collapses as the end approaches” pattern. Instead, they mix both contributing and free-riding late in the game while still returning to full cooperation in the very last round. This indicates that they either do not rely on backward-induction style reasoning, do not prioritize it, or prioritize other motives such as maintaining a cooperative identity or reinforcing norms independently of future payoffs.\n\nThey appear aware that the game has a finite horizon (the interface reveals remaining rounds), but their actions imply that this awareness does not dominate their behavior. Rather than conserving resources or exploiting the final stage, they remain willing to incur cooperative costs at the end. This is consistent with a type who values cooperation as a default stance and is less driven by strictly forward-looking payoff maximization as the game concludes.\n\n<REWARD>\nThis player is an extremely heavy and sometimes extreme user of the reward mechanism. They are clearly willing to spend substantial personal resources to provide rewards to peers, even at the cost of very low or negative round payoffs. This behavior signals strong pro-social or norm-enforcement motives that can override short-term self-interest.\n\nTheir rewarding is broadly directed toward cooperators rather than defectors. They do not appear to systematically reward non-contributors; instead, they seem to reward those who contribute to the public good, attempting to reinforce and encourage cooperative behavior. The amounts they spend on rewards vary widely: in some rounds they give nothing, while in others they invest heavily. This variation suggests a reactive or emotional component—when they perceive cooperative patterns they particularly like, they may respond with bursts of generous rewarding.\n\nThey do not appear to use rewards in a narrowly strategic, profit-maximizing way. Given the reward technology, modest levels of rewarding could already provide positive externalities at reasonable cost, but the player sometimes overshoots, spending far more than is necessary to send a cooperative signal or secure a marginal gain. This behavior is consistent with a “pro-social enthusiast” or “over-committed rewarder” type, who prioritizes supporting cooperators and promoting group welfare over their own monetary outcomes.\n\nThe player also appears somewhat responsive to receiving rewards themselves: after rounds in which they are rewarded, they frequently maintain or resume full cooperation and sometimes also engage in more rewarding. This pattern suggests that they internalize reward as affirmation and may participate in a cycle of mutual reinforcement—cooperation plus reward leading to more cooperation and more reward. However, because they also reward heavily even when their own payoff is harmed, their rewarding is not purely reciprocal; it is partially unconditional and driven by a desire to foster a cooperative environment in general.\n\nIn summary, they are a strong and at times excessive positive reciprocator: they use rewards primarily as a tool to support and encourage cooperative behavior, are willing to incur large personal costs to do so, and do not finely optimize the deployment of rewards for personal gain."
