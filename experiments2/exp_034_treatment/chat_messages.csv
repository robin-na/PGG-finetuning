exp_034_treatment,40f4c4f6,exp_034_treatment_game1,1,agent_2,CAT,"Let's detail our plan: each of us focus on different tasks to reduce redundancy. For example, DOG can handle a specific part of the strategy while CHICKEN tackles another. This division will optimize our collective payoff while maintaining mutual benefit and trust.",2026-01-02T02:18:54.442169
exp_034_treatment,40f4c4f6,exp_034_treatment_game1,1,agent_3,FISH,"I agree. Let's specify roles. I'll focus on resource allocation and support, while DOG and CHICKEN tackle other parts. This minimizes redundancy and maximizes our efforts' effectiveness. Sound good?",2026-01-02T02:18:56.559879
exp_034_treatment,40f4c4f6,exp_034_treatment_game1,1,agent_4,BIRD,I’m on board with the strategic plan. I'll take on task analysis and ensure we aren’t overlapping efforts. This will allow DOG and CHICKEN to focus on strategic execution while FISH manages resource allocation. Let's maximize our collective outcomes.,2026-01-02T02:18:58.189772
