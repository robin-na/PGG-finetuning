The scenario presents a classic public goods game with a group communication phase aimed at coordination. The goal is to maximize the total payoff for everyone involved by contributing to the public fund, where contributions are multiplied and redistributed.

Considering the conversation during the chat stage, all players indicated a willingness to collaborate on an equal contribution plan. Assuming everyone contributes equally, we all stand to gain from the multiplied pool. However, there is a risk here called the ‘free rider problem,’ where one or more players might decide to contribute less than agreed, hoping others make up for it.

Given the conversation, each player seems to genuinely want to cooperate. A full contribution would be in the best interest of maximizing everyone's payoff through a larger pot getting the multiplication effect. But there’s a delicate balance between trust and self-interest.

Contribution decision should thus consider both:
1. Optimistic behavior that all follow through on stated intentions of contributing equally.
2. The potential deterrent effect of future rounds or reputation, though this is not explicitly detailed for a one-round game.

For this single round, given the discussion, the optimal strategy is to assume good faith, contribute fully, thereby setting the standard and signaling trustworthiness.

Let's proceed with the maximum community contribution to show commitment to mutual benefit.

In this public goods game, our group seems to have aligned on a strategy to collaborate for mutual benefit based on equal contribution and distribution. By agreeing to contribute the entire endowment to the public fund, we maximize the multiplied benefits that are evenly distributed among all players, thereby increasing everyone's payoff. This kind of strategy assumes trust and commitment from all players to not defect by withholding contributions or withdrawing excessively.

With the multiplier of 1.7399999999999998, contributing all 20 coins results in 34.8 coins in the public fund, which will then be divided equally among the three players, giving each player a share of 11.6 coins approximately. Adding this to any amount left in our private fund after withdrawal will ensure a higher payoff compared to withdrawing for immediate but lesser private gain.

Given the communication in the chat stage and the agreement to transparency and fairness, I will contribute the entire 20 coins to ensure that the overall payoff is maximized for both myself and the group. This is based on the assumption that all players honor their commitment, which they have verbally agreed to.

However, I will also remain vigilant in the reward stage to ensure fair play if deviations by any player become apparent, and adjust my strategy in future rounds of such games accordingly.

Given the conversation in the chat stage, all players have agreed to an equitable share strategy which can maximize the total payoff if everyone contributes fully to the public fund. By understanding that the payoff from the public fund is multiplied by 1.7399999999999998 and then equally divided among players, it's clear that contributing all our coins to the public fund is optimal.

Each player starts with 20 coins, and if all contribute fully, the fund will have 60 coins. This fund is then multiplied to 104.4 (60 * 1.74), meaning 34.8 coins per player when equally divided among three players. This is considerably more than any individual could gain by keeping coins private.

Furthermore, our pre-contribution chat shows a commitment to a fair approach, suggesting an increased likelihood that all players will contribute fully. If someone deviates, they risk future retribution or reduced cooperation in any extension of this scenario.

Thus, the best strategy given this context and potential social implications of dishonoring the agreement is to contribute the entire initial 20 coins and rely on the honor system established in the chat phase.

In this decision-making stage, I aim to maximize the overall collaborative outcome and possibly improve future interactions by appropriately distributing rewards. With 34.80 coins available, I should carefully consider how to allocate rewards to potentially foster cooperation.

Firstly, rewarding CHICKEN or CAT could encourage them to reciprocate in future stages, which might increase my gains over time. The cost of rewarding is significant at 2 coins per unit, with each unit only providing a marginal benefit of 1.05 coins to the recipient. Thus, rewarding needs to be both strategic and within reason.

Assuming that both players contributed positively in previous rounds based on historical interactions (since this information is not explicitly provided here), rewarding them can enhance the collaborative spirit. However, without specific data indicating who contributed more, a uniform reward distribution might be a safer, more equitable approach.

Therefore, I decide to reward each player with 4 units. This allocation will cost me 16 coins (4 units x 2 coins x 2 players), leaving me with 18.80 coins. This ensures I am promoting a cooperative environment without exhausting my resources, preparing for future rounds and opportunities.

In making my decision about redistributing rewards, I need to assess both the potential benefits and my budget constraint. I have 34.80 coins to potentially utilize in rewarding other players, with each reward costing me 2 coins. 

Adding to the complication, I should also consider the historical behavior and strategic roles of DOG and CAT. If either has shown cooperative or altruistic behavior that may benefit me going forward, rewarding them might bolster future cooperative actions.

Moreover, since each reward unit benefits them more than it costs me in coins, strategic rewarding could foster reciprocal behavior that aids in better future payoffs. Given the information, assuming both have shown equal tendency for cooperation or lack thereof, it might be best not to allocate my entire budget for just this round, preserving resources for future scenarios or deeper need for influencing players.

For instance, allocating 10 coins to each gives them a positive incentive but still conserves 14.80 coins for future rounds. This allows a reasonable signal of cooperation without overspending.

In this redistribution stage, the goal is to strategically use rewards to potentially influence future behaviors and alliances, while keeping my budget constraints in mind. 

Rewarding a player costs 2 coins and grants them 1.05 coins. This means any reward results in a net loss of 0.95 coins for me per unit rewarded. Therefore, it's essential to consider how these rewards might impact future dynamics and whether I can derive greater long-term benefits that outweigh the immediate costs.

1. **DOG**: I need to assess if DOG's past behaviors and potential future alliance could benefit me in the game. If DOG has been cooperative in the past, rewarding them might strengthen the alliance and ensure future cooperation.

2. **CHICKEN**: Similarly, CHICKEN's past behaviors and future potential as an ally must be considered. If CHICKEN has been helpful or could be a strategic partner, rewarding them might incentivize continued cooperation.

Given that the budget is 34.80 coins, I must be judicious with rewards. Rewarding too liberally may deplete resources for future stages when they might be more urgently needed. Conversely, not rewarding at all might fail to secure beneficial alliances.

Finally, maintaining some balance without fully depleting my budget ensures I have flexibility in the latter stages of the game. Rewarding at least one unit might be prudent to signal goodwill but not excessively so as to compromise my position.

Given this strategic thinking, I will reward both DOG and CHICKEN modestly to acknowledge any potential cooperative behaviors without overcommitting my resources.
