In a public goods game like this, the optimal cooperative strategy would typically be for everyone to contribute all of their 20 coins. This is because the group benefit from maximizing the public fund's growth through the multiplication factor (2.24). Ideally, with full cooperation, each player receives the maximum possible payoff. However, the game setting allows for players to withdraw all their coins, effectively contributing nothing, which could lead to higher personal gain if others contribute fully.

Given the rules, if everyone contributes all their coins (e.g., 160 coins in the public fund), the fund would be multiplied to 358.4 coins and each player would receive 44.8 coins. (358.4/8 = 44.8). In this case, everyone benefits significantly above their initial amount.

However, if I withdraw my 20 coins and others contribute all theirs, the fund gets 140 coins initially, becomes 313.6 after multiplication, and each player would receive only 39.2 coins from the public fund. Adding the 20 private coins, I would have 59.2 coins total, but other players would receive 39.2 coins each.

The decision effectively boils down to trusting others to contribute fully. Typically, without prior coordination or established trust, players might act selfishly to maximize individual gains. For this single round, I'm tempted to test human nature's tendency toward selfish play and withdraw all my coins.

Therefore, I will strategically contribute nothing by withdrawing all 20 coins to see if my payoff increases substantially relative to others if they decide to contribute.

In this game, the total payoff for everyone is maximized when all players contribute their full 20 coins to the public fund, as the fund will be multiplied by 2.24 and then distributed evenly, providing a strong overall return. However, without communication, trust becomes a critical issue. If everyone contributes, each person will get back 2.24 times the average contribution of 20 coins. But the dilemma arises due to the possibility of other players choosing to withdraw all their coins, thus gaining more individually if everyone else contributes.

While contributing all coins maximizes collective benefits, individual players may opt to withhold their contributions for personal gain, benefiting from others' cooperation. Given the lack of communication and the temptation for others to free-ride, the safest approach is to assume that not all players will contribute everything. However, to promote cooperation and potential future trustworthiness in a single round context, I will contribute the full amount.

The reasoning here is simple: maximize the group’s payoff — assuming others act similarly — at the risk of being taken advantage of if they don’t. However, in a single-round scenario, convincing others isn't an option, thus the common outcome tends to be non-cooperation. Nevertheless, I am willing to contribute all to set a cooperative tone, hoping at least some will also contribute, ensuring reasonable returns.

In this public goods game, the key is to find the balance between contributing to the public fund and maximizing personal payoff by relying on others' contributions. Since I start with 20 coins in the public fund and can only choose to withdraw either all (20) or none (0), I must decide if I will trust others to contribute or not.

If I contribute nothing (withdraw all 20 coins), I keep my initial coins and gain from the contributions of others, maximized when the others decide to contribute. For example, if everyone else contributes and the total fund becomes significant after the multiplier, my payoff can be substantial even though I did not contribute. However, if everyone thinks similarly, the fund could remain empty, and the payoff from the shared fund would be 0.

Conversely, if I choose to contribute my 20 coins, I risk having less in my private fund if others contribute minimally or not at all. However, this strategy can foster collective benefit if everyone collaborates, leading to a higher overall payoff after the public fund is multiplied.

Since this is a one-shot game without prior knowledge of the other players' behaviors, it is strategically beneficial to contribute initially. This action encourages collective cooperation, leading to better payoffs if others are also inclined to contribute. Based on typical game theory dynamics in public goods games, contributing when others are expected to do so often leads to a better group outcome.

Therefore, I'll attempt to contribute all my coins, hoping that others follow the same logic for a potentially higher payoff.

In this single-round public goods game with a one-time decision, strategic thinking plays a critical role. We have the option to withdraw all 20 coins to our private fund or leave them as a contribution to the public fund. If I choose to contribute nothing (withdraw all), I guarantee holding onto my initial 20 coins and possibly benefit from the collective contribution of others, without risking any personal loss. 

Since the public fund totals contributions from all players and is multiplied by 2.24 before redistribution, each coin contributed by players effectively becomes (2.24 / 8) = 0.28 coins for each player, including myself. Therefore, a contribution increases the total reward pool for everyone. However, if too few people contribute, the public fund's impact might be minimal, given the multiplier.

Considering possible behaviors of the other players:
1. If the others also think strategically and withdraw, contributing nothing, the payout will solely depend on initial private funds, resulting in each player merely keeping 20 coins.
2. If some cooperate, their contributions will enhance the collective payout.

In such games, there is usually a tendency for mixed strategies among players—some might contribute to potentially increase the overall payoff for everyone, while others free-ride. Given the lack of opportunity for future rounds and the absence of reputational effects or communication, the highest personal payoff this round without initial cooperation is to withdraw all 20 coins.

In a one-off setting like this, it's more rational from a self-interest perspective to prioritize retaining personal funds to maximize guaranteed individual earnings without relying on uncertain cooperative behavior from others.

In this final round of the public goods game, my decision will hinge upon the payoff dynamics and potential behavior of other players. Contributing the entire 20 coins to the public fund would entail trusting that other players will do the same, maximizing the public fund for everyone. However, if I keep all 20 coins for myself, I would ensure my private funds.

Let's analyze the potential outcomes:

1. **If everyone contributes 20 coins**: This maximizes the collective pool, leading to a public fund of 160 coins before multiplication. The fund then becomes 160 x 2.24 = 358.4 coins, and each player would receive 44.8 coins. This approach maximizes our mutual gain but relies heavily on universal cooperation.

2. **If I defect (withdraw 20 coins) and others still contribute**: For example, with a remaining public contribution of 140 coins, the multiplied fund becomes 140 x 2.24 = 313.6 coins, and each player receives 39.2. I would have 59.2 (20 kept + 39.2 payoff), benefiting from others' cooperation without contributing.

The dominant strategy in a single-shot scenario without the possibility of future cooperation or reciprocation risk, according to classical game theory, is to defect. Participating players might reason similarly, given that this is the final round with no further repercussions. Everyone acting on a strategy to defect could lead to zero funds to multiply.

Given these considerations and the alignment with classical game-theoretic approaches often observed in final-round scenarios, I will withdraw all 20 coins.

In this game, the optimal strategy is affected by both the multiplier for the public good and the potential actions of other players. The multiplier here is 2.24, which means that if we all contribute our initial coins, the total number of coins will increase significantly, and the redistributed payoff is likely to be more than the original amount each of us started with.

If each player contributes all 20 coins, the total contributed would be \(8 \times 20 = 160\). After multiplication, the fund will become \(160 \times 2.24 = 358.4\), which will be evenly divided among 8 players, resulting in each player receiving 44.8 coins. This is significantly higher than the 20 coins we each start with. 

Given these calculations, it is in my interest, as well as the interest of others, to contribute all 20 coins to maximize our collective payoff. However, there is a risk that some players might not contribute if they aim to maximize their individual payoff by free-riding. 

Since the game is only one round and there's no opportunity for building trust or strategy over multiple rounds, players might lean towards contributing nothing, expecting others to contribute. However, since I cannot communicate with others and have no prior indications of their behavior, contributing everything is still the best option to encourage a higher expected payoff for everyone.

In this public goods game, I have 20 coins that I can either contribute entirely to the public fund or withdraw completely to my private fund. If I contribute all my coins and other players do the same, the public fund will maximize its value, multiplying by 2.24 and then dividing by the 8 players. This would yield the highest possible collective benefit. However, there is a risk that other players might not contribute, aiming to benefit from a larger share without contributing themselves.

If I contribute nothing and others contribute, I still benefit from the multiplied and evenly distributed fund while retaining my private coins. This could maximize my individual payoff if enough others contribute.

Given there’s only one round and historical behavior isn’t provided, players might lean towards self-interest since there's no future consequence or reputation to maintain.

To maximize my payoff under these conditions, I should withdraw all coins (contributing nothing), since others might act similarly given the one-round framework and tendency to free ride.

In analyzing this public goods game, I'll consider both the short-term and hypothetical long-term consequences, even though it's just a single round.

1. **Payoff Calculation**: If I contribute all 20 coins, the entire amount in the public fund will be multiplied by 2.24 and distributed among the 8 players. If everyone else also contributes 20 coins, the fund would be 160 coins, resulting in a total of 358.4 coins (160 * 2.24) being shared. This means each player receives 44.8 coins back (358.4 / 8).

2. **Withdrawal and Keep Strategy**: If I withdraw all 20 coins to my private fund, I will lose the opportunity to help increase the multiplier effect on the public fund, potentially reducing everyone’s payoff, including my own, from the public fund distribution.

3. **Possible Outcomes**:
   - **If I Contribute 0**: I'll keep my 20 coins. If others contribute, I'll benefit from the shared fund after multiplication, ending up with my original coins plus whatever distribution occurs. If others contribute a full 140 coins on average, the fund returns 313.6, giving each player about 39.2 coins.
   - **If I Contribute 20**: This means risking my 20 coins for a potential collective benefit. If others contribute similar amounts, the payoff is higher for everyone.

4. **Strategic Thought**:
   - In a one-round scenario, there’s a strong temptation to ""free ride"" by withdrawing all 20 coins and hoping others contribute, maximizing personal payoff. 
   - However, altruism or group cooperation might convince others also to contribute, maximizing group payoff.

In a single-round game where cooperation has no opportunity to build over time, contributing nothing to secure a guaranteed payoff might be optimal for maximizing personal short-term payoff. However, participating by contributing might foster a collective norm if others are similarly inclined.

Given the rules and psychology often found in these types of games, players might tend toward keeping their coins unless a prior understanding of cooperation exists. Thus, my best strategy in absence of communication is to keep the coins to optimize personal earnings in this one-time scenario.
