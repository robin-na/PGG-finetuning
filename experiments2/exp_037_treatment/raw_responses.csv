In this public goods game, contributing to the public fund can potentially yield a higher collective payoff due to the 1.12 multiplication factor, which benefits all players when contributions increase. However, since contributions are not visible until after the fact, there's a risk of being the only one contributing. If I contribute all my coins (20) and the other player does not contribute any, I risk receiving less than I would by keeping my coins in my private fund.

Considering the mechanics, if both players contribute all their coins, the total fund would be 40, and after multiplication, it becomes 44.8, divided equally to provide each player with a payoff of 22.4. This is a higher payoff than not contributing anything.

In the first round, with no prior information on the other player's tendency to cooperate, contributing nothing minimizes the risk of personal loss if the other player does not cooperate. Additionally, the potential for deductions also affects decision-making—players who contribute nothing initially might face sanctions, which could discourage further retaliatory deductions. Since this is a repeated game, the first round could also set the tone for future cooperation.

With these considerations, despite the potential gains from mutual cooperation, I will choose to contribute nothing to avoid the risk of an immediate disadvantage if the other player also decides not to contribute.

In this game, contributing all 20 coins could potentially lead to a greater overall payoff if both players choose to cooperate. When both players contribute, the total in the public fund would be 40 coins, which after being multiplied by 1.12 would become 44.8 coins. Each player would then receive 22.4 coins as a payoff, which is a gain compared to just holding back and receiving only 20 coins. However, if I contribute and the other player does not, I risk losing because I would receive less than 20 on redistribution.

In the short term, contributing nothing ensures that I maintain my original 20 coins regardless of what the other player does. The key dilemma here is about trust and predicting the next player's move.

Given that this is the first round and there's no history of behavior to rely on, I will choose to contribute all 20 coins, assuming mutual cooperation can be established, which will provide a long-term benefit.

Additionally, showing trust and the intention to cooperate could reduce the likelihood of facing punitive deductions in the subsequent phase.

CHICKEN contributed 20 coins, which appears to be a reasonable contribution and suggests cooperative behavior. Without more context, such as the average contributions of other players or past behavior of CHICKEN, it's challenging to justify any punishment. As such, I will not spend any coins on punishing CHICKEN at this time. This strategy preserves my resources for future rounds or scenarios where punishment might be more justified, thereby maximizing my potential earnings in the long run.

In this redistribution stage, I must consider the strategic implications of punishing the other player, DOG, who did not contribute any coins. Punishing DOG would cost me coins but would also signal dissatisfaction towards non-cooperation.

Punishing DOG may encourage them to contribute in future rounds, fostering a cooperative environment and possibly beneficial for collective success. On the other hand, I must consider the remaining balance in my wallet to ensure I have sufficient funds for future strategic decisions or contributions.

Given that non-contribution can undermine group efforts, a slight punishment could act as a deterrent against future zero contributions without excessively depleting my coins. Maintaining some coins for strategic flexibility in upcoming rounds is also important.

Therefore, applying a minimal punishment could strike a balance between encouraging better behavior and preserving my resources.
