In this game, each player begins with 20 coins and can choose to leave either the entire amount in the public fund or withdraw all of it. After contributions, the total amount in the public fund is amplified by 2.24 and evenly distributed among all players.

If everyone contributes all 20 coins:
- Public Fund: 160 coins
- Multiplied total: 160 * 2.24 = 358.4
- Each player receives 358.4 / 8 = 44.8 coins

In this scenario, each player would end up with 44.8 coins, leading to a net gain of 24.8 coins (in addition to the original 20 coins).

If I contribute nothing and everyone else contributes:
- Public Fund: 140 coins (from 7 players)
- Multiplied total: 140 * 2.24 = 313.6
- Each contributing player receives 313.6 / 8 = 39.2 coins
- I receive 39.2 coins while also keeping my original 20 = 59.2 coins

My net gain from free-riding is higher, making this an appealing outcome, but this behavior may enforce deductions in the punishment stage.

Considering the short-term gain (59.2 vs. 44.8) against long-term group dynamics and potential deductions, contributing all would support cooperative play, minimizing punishment, and fostering potential reciprocity.

However, given no future rounds or established communication, free-riding now maximizes my gain when considering zero long-term impact.

In this public goods game, the total returns for the group are maximized when all players contribute their entire sum to the public fund because the fund is multiplied by 2.24. If everyone contributes their full 20 coins, the total contribution would be 160 coins, which becomes 358.4 after multiplication, and each player would receive 44.8 coins. This is a better payoff than keeping the 20 coins entirely for oneself.

However, there's a risk involved by contributing everything when others may not reciprocate. If I contribute all 20 coins but others do not contribute, my potential gain diminishes significantly. There's also the deduction phase to consider, where players can impose penalties. Contribution signals cooperation, potentially reducing the likelihood of being punished through deductions.

Given that there's no specific historical behavior to analyze since this is the first and only round, I'll aim to balance cooperation and self-interest. Contributing nothing while others might contribute could potentially make me liable to deductions as it would be seen as free-riding on others' contributions.

Therefore, I will contribute 0 initially by withdrawing all 20 coins to my private fund to maximize my guaranteed return, keeping an eye out for deduction retaliation.

In deciding whether to contribute all or nothing, the main consideration is the impact of my decision on my total earnings, as well as predicting the behavior of the other players.

If I withdraw all 20 coins to my private fund, I contribute nothing to the public fund. In this case, I am free-riding: I hope that others contribute so that I still benefit from the multiplied public fund without contributing myself. However, if everyone adopts this strategy, the public fund will be nonexistent, each player gets 0 from the public good, and we only have our 20 private coins.

If I withdraw none of the coins, I contribute all 20 to the public fund. Assuming others do the same, the collective benefit will be maximized, as the fund will be multiplied and equally distributed. The potential risk is that if a majority or significant minority free-rides, my contribution will largely benefit them disproportionately.

The deduction phase introduces an additional layer: if I contribute nothing and others can see this, they might punish me, costing me more than the potential gain from free-riding. On the other hand, if I contribute everything, others might refrain from punishing me, potentially causing those who free-ride to receive deductions.

Considering the multiplier effect of 2.24, if even a small subset of players contribute (e.g., 3 or more), the collective payoff could be higher than simply holding all 20 coins privately. The uncertainty of how the group would act is balanced by the fact that visible non-contribution can lead to punishment.

Taking into account both the collective payoff potential and the threat of punishment for non-cooperation, contributing all my coins reduces the risk of deductions and maximizes cooperative returns. The potential benefits from everyone cooperating are substantial enough to warrant full contribution over a zero-sum, risk-prone free-riding strategy.

In this scenario, the optimal strategy is to contribute all 20 coins to the public fund. Here's the reasoning:
1. By contributing all of my coins, I maximize the potential multiplier effect from the total contributions. Since the public fund is multiplied by 2.24 and then distributed evenly among all players, contributing all can lead to a higher collective payoff.
2. If I opt to keep coins, I lose out on the potential multiplier effect and the redistributed amount, which could end up being significantly more than keeping coins privately.
3. Playing this way improves group dynamics. If everyone contributes, we all benefit symmetrically, hence decreasing the chance of punitive measures.
4. While there is a risk others might not contribute fully, my willingness to contribute can encourage cooperation in future games (or within the dynamic, if players recognize such a strategy).
5. Since there's only one round, other players will likely lean towards cooperation to maximize their one-shot return, especially with the potential for punishing non-cooperative behavior.

Hence, the best decision is to contribute all and hope others do the same for a greater collective payoff.

In this public goods game, the total amount contributed to the public fund is doubled and then evenly distributed, creating a common incentive to maximize public contributions. However, the deduction phase can potentially deter selfish behavior. Here's my strategic reasoning:

1. Contributing all my coins (contributing 0 or withdrawing 0) maximizes the total group payout by ensuring the public fund grows as much as possible, leading to a larger collective return after redistribution.

2. If everyone contributes, collectively, each player would receive more due to the multiplication factor of 2.24. For example, if all 8 players contribute 20 coins, the public fund will have 160 coins, getting doubled to 358.4, and divided back gives each player 44.8 coins.

3. Free-riding—where a player contributes nothing and benefits from others' contributions after redistribution—initially seems advantageous because you keep your own 20 coins and receive a share of the doubled public fund. But this could draw punitive deductions from others, reducing future earnings by more than it gains through any single round benefit.

4. The potential for punitive deductions, which benefits those who contribute, requires careful consideration. Deductions effectively act as an enforcement mechanism against free-riding behaviors.

Based on these factors, contributing all my coins (withdrawing nothing) aligns with maximizing the collective benefit and mitigating the risk of punitive responses by others.

In this public goods game, the key incentive is to maximize total group earnings while balancing individual earnings. If everyone contributes all their coins, the fund multiplies effectively, yielding greater overall returns. Contributing nothing maximizes personal holdings if others contribute, but risks resentments and possible punishment, reducing total outcome for the group and personal long-term gains in a repeated setting.

Given this is a single-round game, players might lean towards maximizing individual payoff by withdrawing all coins. However, the potential for punishment after contributions are revealed exists, making it strategically beneficial to consider contributing fully to maintain harmony and potentially avoid deductions. Fully contributing facilitates the maximum collective gain, considering others emulate similar contribution behavior, resulting in a larger share post-multiplication.

In a one-off round like this with deduction risks and no continuity of interaction beyond this round, contributing possibly allows for optimized reward minus probable deductions enforced for perceived hoarding or selfish play.

Thus, I will contribute all my coins this round amply considering the risk of differentiating behavior may cause punitive deduction more than altruism, leveraging goodwill for maximizing returns across everybody.

In this game, maximizing our earnings requires balancing our individual interests with the collective benefit of all players. Contributing all coins to the public fund would encourage others to do the same, leading to a greater multiplier effect when the fund is doubled and redistributed. However, if I withdraw all my coins, I can secure 20 coins initially but forgo the chance to benefit from collective contributions.

Given that the other players may also be considering either maximization of personal gain or cooperation for a greater joint benefit, I predict a mixed strategy approach from them. As the game includes a punishment stage, actions inconsistent with group cooperation can result in penalties. If every player contributes nothing and then penalizes each other, everyone ends up with less.

Contributing nothing heavily relies on other players contributing their full amount, but since this is the final round, there's less incentive for punishment to deter free-riding behavior across multiple rounds. However, if I'm inclined to contribute fully, others might follow suit, maximizing the total payoff for the entire group.

To foster a level of trust and cooperation and to avoid potential penalties, I will opt for complete contribution with the hope it signals a commitment to cooperation this round and dissuades penalizing behavior from others.

In this public goods game, the optimal strategy from a collective perspective is for everyone to contribute all their coins to maximize the group's total payoff. However, individual incentives may lead players to withhold their contributions to maximize personal gain.

With 8 players, if everyone contributes 20 coins, the public fund will reach 160 coins. Multiplied by 2.24, it becomes 358.4 coins, resulting in a payoff of 44.8 coins per player. If I contribute nothing, the public fund will be 140 coins. Multiplied by 2.24, it becomes 313.6 coins, yielding 39.2 coins for each player while I keep my 20 coins, resulting in a total of 59.2 coins for me.

Despite the temptation to free-ride, punishment mechanisms exist. If my lack of contribution turns other players against me, they might penalize me, reducing my earnings. The cost of punishment for others (3 coins per deduction) might deter them from excessive punishment, but it’s a real risk if many players coordinate against me.

Given it’s the final round and players cannot communicate, others will likely contribute less if they expect free-riding. However, I assess that the risk of punishment outweighs the immediate gain from free-riding. Moreover, contributing fully supports a cooperative norm and minimizes chances of retaliation. Hence, I will choose to contribute all coins, aiming to avoid any deductions and possibly encourage cooperation from others.

If many players choose to contribute fully, my decision will contribute to a higher collective payoff, and I’ll benefit from a larger share.

In this round, it is evident that CHICKEN did not contribute any coins, while all other players contributed 20 coins each. CHICKEN's lack of contribution suggests a deviation from cooperative behavior, potentially undermining the collective effort of the group. 

Punishing CHICKEN could encourage them to contribute more in future rounds, aligning their actions with group norms and fairness. However, I must also consider the cost of issuing punishments, which detracts from my own earnings. The goal is to balance the immediate financial cost with the potential long-term benefit of fostering cooperation.

Given the budget constraint and the need to maintain a sufficient number of coins for future rounds, I will apply punishment to CHICKEN but keep it minimal to ensure the contribution message is sent without eroding my coins significantly. 

I will not punish the other players since they have shown cooperation and contributing behavior, which should be encouraged.

Therefore, I will distribute 2 units of punishment to CHICKEN, costing me 6 coins and lowering CHICKEN's purse by 4 coins, a balanced yet impactful decision aiming to encourage better behavior in subsequent rounds.

In this redistribution stage, the goal is to incentivize cooperative behavior while dissuading non-contributions. In this round, all players except DOG contributed the maximum possible amount of 20 coins. DOG contributed 0 coins, which indicates free-riding behavior, acting against the group’s collective benefit.

Since punishing each player costs me coins and yields a relatively small reduction in their end amount, it's crucial that I use punishments strategically. Punishing the DOG for not contributing helps reinforce the norm of contributing to the group pool, which in the long term, can encourage more consistent and higher contributions if repeated over multiple rounds.

Given that the contributions of CAT, FISH, BIRD, RABBIT, TURTLE, and HAMSTER were optimal in this game setting, they should not receive any punishments. Rewarding them is not possible under the given rules, but avoiding punishment acts as an implicit reward. Keeping coins in my wallet is also favorable to prevent unnecessary expenditure.

I have a budget of 53.60 coins. Each punishment costs me 3 coins. I will choose to punish only DOG with the maximum allowable units I can afford to send a strong message against non-contribution. This choice aligns with a strategy that looks to enhance future cooperative behavior without overspending.

I will assess how much I can realistically spend: 53.60 coins allow me to execute up to 17 punishments, but punishing the free-rider DOG alone will suffice to keep costs low while effectively signaling the importance of contribution.

Therefore, I will apply 17 punishment units to DOG.

In assessing the contributions, DOG and CHICKEN both contributed 0 coins, while the others contributed 20 coins each. Given that the total amount I can utilize is 33.60 coins, and each punishment unit costs me 3 coins, I can distribute a maximum of 11 punishment units.

Contributors who contributed 20 coins have participated maximally under the assumption that 20 coins is a standard or target contribution. Hence, they should not be punished.

The strategic approach is to primarily focus on DOG and CHICKEN who did not contribute anything. Since cooperation is usually fostered by rewarding good behavior rather than punishing, however, when all other participants have met a non-zero norm and a minority hasn't, punishment can be an incentivizing mechanism for future contribution compliance.

Considering a fair and balanced approach, it would be strategic to apply a moderate degree of punishment on both DOG and CHICKEN, dividing the available punishment units equally. This ensures that the punishment is proportional but not overly excessive, which might foster cooperation in the following rounds. I will allocate 5 punishment units to each of DOG and CHICKEN, using a total of 15 coins out of my 33.60 available, ensuring I remain within budget.

Therefore, the decision is:
- DOG: 5 punishments (15 coins * 1.5 efficiency = 7.5 coins decrease for them)
- CHICKEN: 5 punishments (15 coins * 1.5 efficiency = 7.5 coins decrease for them)
- FISH, BIRD, RABBIT, TURTLE, HAMSTER: 0 punishments as they contributed optimally.

This approach maintains enough flexibility for future rounds, preserves some of my coin balance, and ensures the message is sent clearly about contribution expectations.

In this game, the goal is to maximize my payoff by influencing future contributions through strategic punishments. Based on the contribution history, DOG and CHICKEN did not contribute any coins this round. This might indicate free-riding behavior, which could discourage other players from contributing in future rounds. Conversely, CAT, BIRD, RABBIT, TURTLE, and HAMSTER each contributed 20 coins, showing cooperative behavior.

To encourage future contributions and deter free-riding, I will focus on punishing DOG and CHICKEN as a signal that non-contributory behavior has negative consequences. I will not punish CAT, BIRD, RABBIT, TURTLE, and HAMSTER as their contributions promote collective benefit.

Given my budget constraint of 33.60 coins, I need to ensure I do not exceed this amount. The cost for each punishment unit is 3 coins, so I can afford up to 11 punishment units in total. I will spread the punishments evenly between DOG and CHICKEN, allocating 5 punishment units to each, as this will cost me 30 coins and leave a small buffer within my budget.

The remaining players demonstrated cooperative behavior, so I will not allocate any punishment units to them.

In this redistribution stage, we need to analyze the contributions of each player to determine any punishments. Our goal is to create an environment that fosters consistent contributions in future rounds, enhancing the collective wealth while also maximizing individual earnings.

Here's a breakdown of the contributions:
- DOG and CHICKEN contributed 0 coins, which negatively impacts the group's potential surplus.
- CAT, FISH, RABBIT, TURTLE, and HAMSTER each contributed 20 coins, indicating they are supporting the group effort.

Given that DOG and CHICKEN did not contribute, they may warrant punishment to incentivize them to contribute in the future. The punishment should be balanced, ensuring it deters non-contributing behavior without creating ill-will that could reduce future contributions or prompt retaliation.

CAT, FISH, RABBIT, TURTLE, and HAMSTER contributed positively. No punishment should be allocated to them as it might discourage their future contributions.

Considering my budget constraint:
- I have 33.60 coins available.
- Each punishment unit costs 3 coins, meaning I could allocate up to 11 units entirely if necessary (33.60/3 = 11.2).
- However, I will focus on strategic punishment rather than maximum punishment to maintain good alignment among players.

Thus, I would allocate:
- 3 punishment units to DOG, costing me 9 coins and deducting 6 coins from DOG.
- 3 punishment units to CHICKEN, costing me another 9 coins and deducting 6 coins from CHICKEN.

This leaves me with 33.60 - 18 = 15.60 coins unused, ensuring I stay within my budget while making a statement about the importance of contribution.

In this redistribution stage, my primary goal is to encourage fair contributions while ensuring I don't spend excessively on punishments, as they directly decrease my earnings. Analyze the contributions:

- DOG and CHICKEN contributed nothing, likely expecting to benefit from others' efforts. This behavior is detrimental to group collaboration and long-term game sustainability.
- CAT, FISH, BIRD, TURTLE, and HAMSTER each contributed 20 coins, showing consistent commitment to collective benefit.

Since I can afford some punishment without exhausting my wallet:

1. Focus punishment on low contributors to discourage future free-riding:
   - DOG: 2 units (6 coins spent to deduct 4 coins from DOG)
   - CHICKEN: 1 unit (3 coins spent to deduct 2 coins from CHICKEN)

By targeting DOG more heavily and CHICKEN to a lesser extent, I intend to signal the importance of contribution, hoping it motivates them to contribute in future rounds. I avoid punishing high contributors, as I want to sustain their cooperative behavior. This approach also preserves my wallet balance for potential future rounds where strategic spending can be necessary.

Total spending: 6 (DOG) + 3 (CHICKEN) = 9 coins. This leaves 24.60 coins, ensuring a buffer for future decisions or needs.

In this round, DOG and CHICKEN have contributed nothing, while CAT, FISH, BIRD, RABBIT, and HAMSTER each contributed 20 coins. To promote cooperation and discourage free-riding in future rounds, I should consider punishing DOG and CHICKEN for not contributing.

However, my punishment is limited by my budget of 33.60 coins. Each punishment unit costs me 3 coins, which means I can afford up to 11 punishment units in total (33.60 / 3 = 11.2, rounding down to 11 units). My goal is to encourage maximal future cooperation.

I will allocate more punishment units to DOG and CHICKEN equally, since their lack of contribution is the same. This sends a strong message to encourage future contributions, but I also want to ensure I strictly stay within my budget. Punishing them both with 5 units will cost me 30 coins in total (5 units x 6 coins total per player), leaving me with a conservative approach still within budget.
 
For the contributors CAT, FISH, BIRD, RABBIT, and HAMSTER who all made the maximum contribution, I won't allocate any punishment, since their actions align with cooperative gameplay. This positive reinforcement may implicitly encourage sustained cooperation without additional cost from my budget.

In this redistribution stage, the focus is on punishing or rewarding players based on their contribution behavior. Contributions are important for the collective benefit, meaning players who contributed 20 coins (CAT, FISH, BIRD, RABBIT, TURTLE) are supporting the group's success, while those who contributed 0 coins (DOG, CHICKEN) are not fulfilling their part.

Punishing non-contributors is a strategic move to encourage future cooperation. The goal is to create a balanced environment where contributions are seen as beneficial and non-contributors understand the consequences.

Given the budget constraint and the fact that each punishment unit costs 3 coins and reduces the punished player's coins by 2, it's efficient to focus on those who did not contribute at all. This approach helps maintain enough resources for potential future actions and encourages cooperative behavior in the next rounds.

Therefore, I will allocate punishment to DOG and CHICKEN. Each will receive 2 units of punishment. This will cost me 12 coins in total, which is within my budget, leaving 21.6 coins remaining.

Contributors will not receive any punishments or rewards in this round, as maintaining available resources is important for future strategic decisions.
