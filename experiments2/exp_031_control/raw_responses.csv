In the public goods game, the incentive is to maximize personal gain, but this is balanced against the potential cooperative gain shared amongst the group. By leaving all 20 coins in the public fund, I contribute fully, maximizing the shared pool. This will yield a payoff of (20 + contributions from others) * 0.75 / 3 for each player. 

If all players contribute fully, each gets a payoff of 15 coins, which means a net loss of 5 coins from the original 20. However, if any player chooses to withdraw all their coins, they keep 20 coins, and the public pool will be less rewarding for the others. Initially, it seems strategic to test the group's cooperation level.

By contributing fully and observing others' behavior in the first round, I can gauge the cooperativeness of my group members (DOG, CHICKEN) for future rounds. If they also contribute fully, it sets a cooperative precedent; if not, it informs future strategy adjustments.

In this game, each player starts with 20 coins and can withdraw either all or nothing. The contribution to the public fund is multiplied by 0.75 and then equally distributed among players. If I contribute all (meaning I withdraw nothing), I can potentially maximize the group's return from the multiplier, especially if other players also contribute. However, there's a chance that other players might withdraw all their coins, leaving only my 20 coins. If no one contributes (withdraws all), the group earns nothing collectively but retains individual amounts. The challenge is to think as a group without communication, balancing altruism and strategic self-interest.

To maximize potential benefits while evaluating risk, I will contribute this round to see how others respond. This initial move assumes cooperation from others and sets a potential precedent for future cooperative behavior.

In the first round, we have no prior information about how the other players might behave. The game's setup incentivizes contributions to the public fund since the payoff for the group is shared, with each coin contributed resulting in a shared benefit after multiplication by 0.75. However, withdrawing all 20 coins ensures a guaranteed private payoff of 20 coins, avoiding the risk of others not contributing.

If all players contribute, each player ends up with a payoff higher than their initial 20 coins after redistribution (since 60 coins times 0.75, divided by 3, results in 15 coins per player, plus the 20 coins each retained, totals 35 coins per player). This would be the best collective outcome.

However, in the absence of any trust or historical behavior from the other players, there's uncertainty. The safe option ensures that I don't end up worse than my starting position. My strategy will be to try to test cooperation initially by making a contribution in this round and then adapting my strategy in the subsequent rounds based on players' behavior. 

In many experimental settings, seeing an initial cooperative move can establish mutual trust, even among strangers, which might encourage further cooperation in future rounds. Since I have nothing to lose and potentially much to gain if others reciprocate, I choose to contribute all 20 coins this round.
