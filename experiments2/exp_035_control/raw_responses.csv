In this game, the key decision revolves around contributing either all or none of my coins to the public fund. If both players contribute all their coins, the total in the public fund will be 40 coins, which after being multiplied by 0.58 results in a collective payoff of 23.2 coins. This amount is then evenly split between the players, giving each 11.6 coins. Even with rounding, I would end up receiving 12 coins back which means a net loss since I contributed 20.

If I contribute nothing and my co-player contributes all their coins, the fund will contain 20 coins, which after multiplication yields a payoff of 11.6 coins shared, giving each player 5.8 coins or 6 coins due to rounding. In this scenario, I would keep my 20 coins plus the 6, totaling 26 coins, while they net a significant loss.

If both choose to contribute nothing, the total fund is multiplied by 0.58, resulting in a payoff of 0. Each player walks away with the original 20 coins.

In light of these scenarios, contributing nothing seems optimal from a purely individualistic perspective. However, if both players think the same way and contribute nothing, they're guaranteed the original 20 coins versus a possible cooperative outcome that does not considerably elevate the profit due to the multiplier.

Therefore, purely from an earnings point and considering this is a one-round game with no long-term repercussions, the most financially rewarding individual strategy is to contribute nothing.

In this public goods game, my payoff will be the sum of my remaining personal funds plus my share of the redistributed public funds. If both players contribute all their coins, the total public fund would be 40 coins, resulting in a multiplied amount of 40 * 0.58 = 23.2 coins. Each player would then receive 23.2 / 2 = 11.6 coins from the fund, giving each player a total of 11.6 coins from the fund plus any leftover personal funds.

By contributing all 20 coins, I'm relying on the other player to also contribute to maximize our shared returns. If the other player contributes nothing and keeps their 20 coins, the total fund will be 20 * 0.58 = 11.6, and I would only receive 11.6 / 2 = 5.8 coins, resulting in a lower payoff compared to if we both contributed.

On the other hand, if I contribute nothing and the other contributes all, the public fund multiplies to 11.6 coins, and I would also receive 5.8 coins, but I would keep my original 20, totaling 25.8.

The best scenario for collective gain is mutual cooperation where both contribute, but individually, the dominant strategy is to contribute nothing since it guarantees keeping the initial 20 coins plus whatever is redistributed, which would be more than if only I contributed.

Given it's a single round game with no future rounds to influence decisions through iterated interactions, rational play suggests contributing nothing is optimal to maximize personal payoff.
