exp_013_treatment,af431917,exp_013_treatment_game1,1,agent_0,DOG,contribution,"<REASONING>
In this public goods game, the best strategy for maximum collective payoff is to contribute all 20 coins to the public fund. If all players contribute, the public fund (60 coins) will be multiplied by 0.69, giving 41.4 coins, which will then be divided equally among the three players, resulting in 13.8 coins each. This payoff is higher than keeping all 20 coins in private funds since, in the latter case, each player would only secure their own 20 coins without gaining any additional coins from the fund multiplier effect.

The key to this strategy is trust among players. Given the strong alignment shown in the chat messages, where all players, DOG, CHICKEN, and CAT, have explicitly agreed to cooperate, there is a fair basis for expecting that cooperation will be upheld. Choosing to contribute nothing could lead to immediate gains but would likely result in mutual deductions, reducing overall net earnings.

Therefore, with trust being established and the alignment towards cooperation confirmed, contributing all 20 coins to the public fund appears to be the most rational strategy to maximize earnings.

Given the initial discussion among players DOG, CHICKEN, and me, there appears to be a strong agreement on cooperating to maximize our collective payoff. The multiplier of the public fund contributions when pooled as a group and divided evenly provides more value than if any individual defected and kept all their coins private. With everyone collectively committing to contributing, each shares in a larger multiplication factor, thus increasing the total payoff for all players.

However, there is always a risk of someone defecting after seeing everyone's strategic agreement, which might be tempting for short-term gain (one might keep the full 20 and benefit from others' contributions). But in this single round context, an optimal cooperative scenario is achieved when everyone contributes fully — the reward multiplication will benefit each member when divided equally. Given everyone’s expressed willingness to collaborate, the most strategic choice is to align with the group and contribute fully to the public fund.

Moreover, should anyone choose to defect, they risk retaliatory deductions which, while reducing overall earnings for the punisher as well, would punish a defector severely. The chat suggests a commitment from all, and since rewards can mitigate losses through short-term rewards/cost up to a small extent, cooperation remains the most beneficial.

Thus, I will contribute all my coins to the public fund to ensure maximum joint profit from this cooperation.

In this game, cooperation seems to be the optimal strategy for maximizing the total payoff, as stated by all participants in the chat stage. If every player contributes all their coins to the public fund, the total contribution would be multiplied by 0.69 and then distributed evenly among players, leading to a better outcome for everyone compared to contributing nothing. Given that both DOG and CHICKEN have expressed their commitment to contributing, aligning with this approach is advantageous.

Moreover, as everyone has verbally agreed to cooperate, defecting by withdrawing all coins might lead to negative repercussions in the form of deductions from the other players' potential rewards, which could outweigh any short-term gain from withholding coins.

Therefore, to maximize long-term gains and maintain trust, the best approach is to contribute all my coins to the public fund.

In this scenario, both CHICKEN and CAT contributed 20 coins each. Assuming these contributions were substantial relative to potential expectations or previous rounds, it might be strategic to encourage such behavior by providing a small reward. However, given the cost of rewards, it is not economically efficient to reward heavily because I would incur a larger cost for a less than equal benefit to them. 

The budget constraint is 13.80 coins, and I must consider maximum efficiency. Since rewarding costs me 2 coins per unit and grants them 0.94 coins, I need to balance rewarding good behavior without depleting my funds excessively. A nominal positive reinforcement approach should suffice, providing an incentive to keep contributions high without significant personal expense.

To incentivize both players lightly while maintaining a strong budgetary sense, I will reward each with 1 unit. This costs me 4 coins in total (2 coins per player), leaving plenty of funds for future rounds or any necessary punishments for undesirable behavior by other players.

In this contribution round, both DOG and CAT contributed 20 coins, which suggests cooperative behavior. I want to encourage this type of behavior to ensure continued cooperation and maximize future payoffs. Therefore, I will focus on rewarding rather than punishing. Since each reward costs 2 coins and grants 0.94 coins to the target, I aim to balance my available budget of 13.80 coins while reinforcing positive contributions.

I can afford to spend a total of 13.80 coins on rewards, if I use 6 units, it will cost me 12 coins (6 units * 2 coins per unit) and grant 5.64 coins to the target (6 units * 0.94 coins). To maintain investment, I will allocate 3 reward units to DOG and 3 reward units to CAT, which respects the budget constraint and promotes ongoing cooperation between players.

Given that both DOG and CHICKEN contributed the same amount (20 coins), there is no compelling reason to either punish or reward them disproportionately. Punishing would reduce their coins without gaining significant benefit for me, and rewarding would cost more than it benefits, considering the conversion rate for rewards (2 coins cost for only 0.94 coins given to the recipient per unit).

Considering the current rules, and aiming to preserve my available resources for future rounds (which may involve more beneficial strategic opportunities), it seems prudent not to use my coins on punishment or reward in this scenario. Maintaining a reserve potentially allows for more impactful decisions should contributions deviate or if other players decide on redistribution strategies that influence their future actions.
