Forming a cooperative strategy could lead to higher payoffs for everyone. I'll propose mutual cooperation, ensuring we remain trustworthy and maximize collective returns. This can lead to better outcomes in subsequent rounds if established early.

Let's agree to cooperate throughout the game for maximum collective gains. Consistent cooperation can lead to higher rewards for everyone. Are you all in?",2026-01-02T01:20:55.339833
exp_016_treatment,47c43f43,exp_016_treatment_game1,1,agent_1,CHICKEN,I agree with DOG's proposal. Let's cooperate consistently to enhance our collective returns this round and beyond. Is everyone willing to commit to this strategy?,2026-01-02T01:20:56.566461
exp_016_treatment,47c43f43,exp_016_treatment_game1,1,agent_2,CAT,I'm on board with cooperation but suggest we establish a trust mechanism or penalty for defecting to ensure commitment. This could help solidify our strategy and minimize risk.,2026-01-02T01:20:58.185476
exp_016_treatment,47c43f43,exp_016_treatment_game1,1,agent_3,FISH,"I support cooperation. Let's implement a rotating monitor system where one player ensures everyone's commitment each round, enhancing trust and discouraging defection. Thoughts?",2026-01-02T01:20:59.881212
exp_016_treatment,47c43f43,exp_016_treatment_game1,1,agent_4,BIRD,"<REASONING>
While cooperation is ideal, risk of defection remains. FISH's monitor system is innovative. I'll suggest implementing it with a light penalty to deter uncooperative behavior without severe consequences. The focus is on trust-building.

<MESSAGE>
I agree with the cooperation strategy and FISH's monitor idea. Let's implement it with a small penalty for defectors, ensuring commitment while minimizing risks. Does everyone agree with this addition?",2026-01-02T01:21:01.580236
exp_016_treatment,47c43f43,exp_016_treatment_game1,1,agent_5,RABBIT,I support cooperation and FISH's monitor system. Let's appoint a fixed monitor for each round and focus on consistent collective benefits. Small penalties deter defection but ensure trust.,2026-01-02T01:21:03.081931
