Forming an early alliance and contributing the maximum amount seems promising given the willingness of others to cooperate. The public fund's multiplier (1.7999999999999998) ensures that the return from the public fund, if we all contribute fully, will be significantly higher than the amount contributed (54 total contribution leads to a payout of 32.38 per player), compared to keeping funds privately (leading to a personal holding of just 20 coins per player). Committing fully in the first round signals trust and sets a positive norm for cooperation. Additionally, my full contribution could encourage similar behavior in DOG and CHICKEN, leading to maximized earnings. However, I should also be cautious and observe if any player undermines the trust in future rounds by not contributing equally.

From the chat, it appears that the other players are inclined towards forming an alliance for cooperative contribution. In a public goods game, cooperation generally leads to maximizing group payoffs. By contributing to the public fund, I can gain trust and potentially encourage others to also contribute a significant amount. Given the multiplier effect, even a high collective contribution would still result in a net gain for each player. However, there is the risk that others might defect and contribute less, benefitting from my contribution. 

The key to maximizing profit in this scenario is to strike a balance between trusting other players and protecting my own funds from exploitation. An initial strong gesture of goodwill might prompt reciprocity in future rounds. I will contribute a moderate amount that shows willingness to cooperate but also retains a buffer in case others do not contribute as much.

In order to maximize our total earnings, cooperating by contributing to the public fund could be beneficial. Given that both DOG and CAT seem open to forming an alliance aimed at increasing our group's payoffs by coordinating contributions, contributing a reasonable amount will help demonstrate commitment and encourage mutual cooperation. Furthermore, contributing a moderate amount initially can also help gauge others' responses without overcommitting. This way, there is room to adjust strategies in subsequent rounds based on observed behavior. Starting with a cooperative gesture often encourages similar behavior from other players, promoting a stable and beneficial dynamic for all. I aim to balance risk and potential rewards, considering that a significant yet not maximum contribution could establish trust and set a collaborative tone.

exp_009_treatment,599cb3c2,exp_009_treatment_game1,1,agent_0,DOG,redistribution,"<REASONING>
To make strategic decisions regarding the redistribution, I need to consider several factors. Firstly, the contribution levels: CHICKEN contributed 12 coins, while CAT contributed 10 coins. Both players made positive contributions, which indicates cooperative behavior. Punishing them would likely discourage future cooperation, which is not beneficial in the long run.

Now, analyzing the cost and effects of potential actions:
1. **Rewarding:** For each unit I reward, it costs me 3 coins and grants the other player 0.7 coins. This means for 1 reward unit, my net cost is 2.3 coins since only 0.7 gets added to the other player's total. This is quite costly relative to the benefit gained by the other player, which might not promote much increased cooperative behavior considering the small gain they actually receive.

2. **Punishing:** Costs 1 coin and deducts 1 from the target. In situations where players make significant negative contributions, punishing might be considered. Here, contributions were healthy, so punishment isn't needed.

Given the positive contributions from both CHICKEN and CAT, I choose not to punish either player. Rewards are less efficient in translating to cooperative gains, but a small reward to the player with the highest contribution might foster a positive atmosphere, promoting future high contributions. Therefore, I will only use a minimal reward on CHICKEN as an acknowledgment for slightly higher cooperation to maintain a healthy dynamic without significantly depleting my resources.

With these considerations, I'll reward CHICKEN with 1 unit and not make any changes for CAT.

In this redistribution stage, my goal is to maximize the long-term benefits of the group while also considering my budget constraints. DOG contributed significantly more coins than CAT, suggesting a higher level of cooperation and investment in the common pool. Rewarding DOG could incentivize them to maintain or increase their high contribution level in future rounds, fostering a cooperative environment.

CAT, on the other hand, contributed less, and it's crucial to decide whether to punish to deter low contributions or to ignore. Punishing CAT could lead to resentment and lower morale, potentially reducing their future contributions even more. 

Given these dynamics and my budget of 33.20 coins, rewarding DOG would cost 3 coins for every 0.7 coin rewarded to DOG, while punishing CAT would decrease both CAT's wallet and my own by the same amount for every unit.

* Rewarding DOG strengthens cooperation; however, due to the low conversion rate (0.7 coins per 3 spent), smaller rewards may be appropriate.
* Not punishing CAT avoids potential negative consequences of a punishment that might deter future contributions more.

Therefore, I will allocate a small amount towards rewarding DOG but refrain from punishing CAT to preserve my budget and maintain a cooperative spirit.

Both DOG and CHICKEN have made contributions to the common pool, with DOG contributing significantly more than CHICKEN. My main goal is to maximize my total earnings in both this and future rounds by encouraging cooperative behavior. 

Given the rules of punishment and reward:

1. Punishing costs 1 coin and deducts 1 coin from the target.
2. Rewarding costs 3 coins and grants 0.7 coins to the target.

Rewards are costly and only provide a partial return to the recipient, while punishments are straightforward but can create negative sentiment. Since my budget is limited to 35.20 coins, I need to weigh the impact of each move carefully.

DOG has contributed more and should be encouraged to continue this behavior, while CHICKEN also contributed but less so. Also, rewarding DOG might set a positive precedent, encouraging higher contributions from both DOG and others in future rounds.

Considering the budget constraint and the fact that I would like to positively reinforce high contributions:
- I will reward DOG to incentivize their high contribution.
- I will neither punish nor reward CHICKEN as their contribution was smaller but still non-zero.

Thus, I will allocate my budget solely towards rewarding DOG, for a moderate encouragement without spending excessively.
