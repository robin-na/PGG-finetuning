Each round, you are given 20 coins and need to decide how many coins to put into the shared pot (either 0 or 20).\nYou will not see others' choices before you decide.\nThe pot is multiplied by 2.8× and split equally among all players.\nYour round payoff is: coins you kept + your equal share of the multiplied pot.\nAfter contributions are redistributed, players may reward each other.\nAt the start of each round, you may optionally send ONE short message to the group.\n# GAME STARTS\n<ROUND i=\"1 of 17\">\n<ROUND_INFO> 20 coins are currently in your private pocket.
