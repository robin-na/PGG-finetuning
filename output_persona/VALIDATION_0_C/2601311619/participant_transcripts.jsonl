Recall that you're probably playing games with different people from the past, and that the exact rules of this game could differ from the ones you've played before.\n<TRANSCRIPT STARTS>\nYou are playing an online public goods game (PGG). Each round, you are given 20 coins and need to decide how many coins to put into the shared pot (integer from 0 to 20).\nYou will not see others' choices before you decide.\nThe pot is multiplied by 4.2× and split equally among all players.\nYour round payoff is: coins you kept + your equal share of the multiplied pot.\nAfter contributions are redistributed, players may reward each other.\n# GAME STARTS\n<ROUND i=\"1 of 28\">\n<ROUND_INFO> 20 coins are currently in the public fund, and you will contribute the remainder of the coins you choose to take for yourself.
